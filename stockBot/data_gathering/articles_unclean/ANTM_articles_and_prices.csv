 UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Humana would be among the big winners if the Trump-Ryan health-care bill is approved by the House on Friday, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte told CNBC. 
 Gupte, an equity research senior analyst covering health care, said the pharmaceutical industry also would come out well under the American Health Care Act.
""They didn't have drug pricing legislation built into this,"" Gupte said on ""Squawk Box.""
 ""They got a tax break. Maybe they can give some of that back to consumers in the form of co-pay assistance that may get the government off their back and the president's populist agenda gets served as well,"" she said.
The pharma industry has been scrutinized by lawmakers after leading drugmakers hiked their prices, sometimes by triple digits. Some analyst, however, say those companies are outliers.
The House is expected to vote Friday on the bill backed by President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama's  Affordable Care Act. 
The vote was postponed Thursday after Republican leaders failed to rally enough support to pass the bill because of a rebellion by the conservative Freedom Caucus and moderate Republicans. Trump has demanded that the House approve the plan as is Friday or leave Obamacare in place.

2,2017-03-30,Big Obamacare insurer Anthem seen 'leaning toward exiting' many areas where it now sells plans  ,"T.J. Kirkpatrick | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Joseph Swedish, chief executive officer of Anthem.
 A new analyst report says there is reason to believe that major Obamacare insurer Anthem ""is leaning toward exiting a high percentage"" of the insurance regions where it currently sells individual health plans.
 If that happens, millions of Obamacare customers and potential customers would be left in 2018 with even fewer choices of insurers than they have now.
The report on Thursday from Jefferies comes almost two months after Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish warned the insurer, which sells plans under the Blue Cross Blue Shield might decide within months ""whether or not we surgically extract ourselves from certain rating regions, or even on a larger scale, depending on the stability of the marketplace.""
 In recent conversations with Jeffreries analysts, Anthem management referred to the statements about ""surgical reductions, but currently seems to be leaning toward broader extraction,"" the report said.

 McConnell: Hard to predict coverage under GOP bill   
 3:22  PM ET Tue, 14 March 2017 |  01:58 
 News of the Jefferies' analysis first was reported by Bloomberg.
Anthem currently insures more than 800,000 individual plan customers in 144 rating regions in 14 states.
Other major insurers, including Aetna, UnitedHealthcare, Cigna and Humana, have already scaled back their footprints in the Obamacare markets.
But Anthem's exit would potentially have a bigger impact.
Earlier this month, an analysis by Axios.com said, ""An Anthem exit would cause arguably the most disruption nationwide.""
""Roughly 255,000 people across Colorado, Kentucky, Missouri and Ohio would have no Obamacare insurers for 2018, and 560,000 people in eight states would have just one insurer,"" the analysis by Axios.com said.
Anthem's management has indicated that it would like regulatory changes that could lower the financial risk it runs in insuring Obamacare customers.
The Jefferies report said that management told the analysts that ""regulatory advocacy needs to progress significantly in the next 'month or so.' ""
""Improvements such as eligibility verification, more rigid special enrollment periods, shortening of premium grace periods are steps in the right direction, but not enough,"" the Jefferies analysts wrote of Anthem's view.
Another factor that would play into Anthem's decision on whether, and to what extent, to pull out of Obamacare markets is the level of health claims that its current pool of customers will end up having this year.
Management told Jefferies that it normally takes up to six months of claims ""to get a sense of risk profile on its new enrollees (so, mid-year).""

 Anthem's management also expects that state insurance departments will tend to approve substantially higher premium rates for 2018 plans, as they did for plans that went into effect in January of this year, ""in efforts to sustain individual markets.""
Asked about the Jefferies report, Anthem told CNBC that the company ""has served consumers in the individual health insurance market for over seven decades.""
""Since the launch of the ACA in 2014, we have been in continuous dialogue with previous and current administrations and Congress to emphasize the importance of regulatory and statutory changes in order to ensure sustainability and affordability of the Individual market for consumers,"" Anthem said.
""We continue to actively pursue policy changes that will help with market stabilization and achieve the common goal of making quality health care more affordable and accessible for all.""
Robert Laszewski, a health insurance analyst, in a blog post on the Jefferies report, wrote, ""Will Anthem, part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield exchange market backbone left in most of the states, really exit? Or, is this just a negotiating ploy just as the Trump administration is about to make key decisions regarding the Obamacare exchange market for 2018?""
""I have my doubts that Anthem will end up exiting the Obamacare exchanges,"" wrote Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates.
""While Anthem is a publicly traded company, its legacy Blue Cross plans in the 14 states in which it participates have a long tradition of being a community partner.""

 Express Scripts CEO on Anthem contract: Time to show investors power in our core   
 7:06  PM ET Mon, 24 April 2017 |  05:23 
 The fact that Anthem wants to cut ties with Express Scripts is ""perplexing,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC on Monday.
 The pharmacy benefit manager announced on Monday its PBM contract with health-benefits company Anthem was unlikely to be extended after its expiration in late 2019.
""We've given them terrific service,"" Wentworth said in an interview with ""Closing Bell.""
 ""I would love nothing more than to find a way to keep Anthem as a client. We've offered them billions of dollars of rate relief for the next three years — price concessions, as it were — that they're not contractually entitled to.""
Shares of Express Scripts fell more than 15 percent after the bell on Monday.
Last month, a federal judge dismissed two of the six counterclaims that Express Scripts raised in health insurer Anthem's $15 billion lawsuit claiming it charged too much for drugs.
Anthem had sued Express Scripts in March 2016, accusing it of excessive pricing and operational failures. It also sought the right to terminate its 10-year contract with Express Scripts.
Wentworth called the 2009 deal with Anthem ""transformational"" and noted that Anthem ultimately wound up with $4.7 billion up front that he said Anthem used to buy its stock back.
""We got them back in business in 2009, in their sanctioned CMS business. We delivered costs savings to them out of the shoot. They actually came up short in the short run in terms of delivering claims to us, and this deal actually didn't look terrific in the early years,"" he said.
He also brushed aside any notion that there may be more pressure from its other 2,900 clients, noting that the Anthem deal was different from all the others.
""Our 98 percent retention rate, 97.5 percent last year, proves that we're actually delivering for those clients,"" said Wentworth.

4,2017-04-26,Anthem could bolt from Obamacare exchange if subsidies are cut  ,"Getty Images
 Anthem, the largest insurer providing individual Obamacare exchange plans, said it may drop out of state exchanges next year, if the uncertainty over funding of cost-sharing reduction subsidies is not resolved in Washington in the next month.
 ""We plan to file preliminary 2018 rates with the assumption that the cost-sharing reductions will be funded,"" Anthem Chairman and CEO Joseph Swedish told investors on the company's first-quarter earnings call.
""We are notifying our states that if we do not have certainty that CSRs will be funded for 2018 by early June, we will need to evaluate appropriate adjustments to our filing,"" Swedish said. Those adjustments could include resubmitting higher rates increases, ""or exiting certain individual ACA-compliant markets altogether.""
 Anthem's first-quarter profit was well above analyst expectations, helped in part by higher premium rates on its Affordable Care Act exchange plans. The health insurer earned an adjusted $4.68 per share, well above the Thomson Reuters estimate of $3.86 per share. On the top line, $22.32 billion in revenue was more than $1 billion higher than analyst expectations, driven by strong enrollment growth across its commercial, Medicaid and Medicare products.
Anthem executives said they were encouraged by some of the moves taken by the Trump administration to stabilize the market, including tighter special enrollment rules.
They said they continue to engage congressional and administration officials in Washington about additional steps that will help increase stability, including funding for high-risk pools and reinsurance to help offset very high-cost patients, as well as the CSR payments.
Health insurers, hospital groups and other health-care industry advocates have been pressing congressional leaders and the Trump administration to fund the so-called CSRs, which reduce out-of-pockets costs for millions of low-income Obamacare enrollees. The insurers front the initial costs, which for 2017 are estimated to be roughly $7 billion. Until now, the government has reimbursed them for those payments.
The administration and congressional leaders have given mixed signals about the fate of CSR funding. Republican congressional leaders, who sued the Obama administration over funding authorization for the CSRs, say they can continue for now. President Donald Trump in recent weeks hinted that continued funding for the subsidies was up for negotiation.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said Republicans are close to reaching consensus on a new health-care reform bill that addresses reducing premium costs, but the new amendment to the American Health Care Act by Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey would not address the cost-sharing subsidies.
""CSRs — we're not doing that,"" Ryan told reporters at his weekly news conference. ""That is not in the appropriation bill, that's something separate that the administration does.""
Without clarity soon on the CSRs and the health insurer tax for 2018, Anthem said the industry will have a hard time coming up with rates.
""Before accounting for any other issues, rates could increase by an additional 20 percent or more if CSR subsidies are not funded. The return of the health insurance tax is also expected to increase rates by an additional 3 to 5 percent,"" said Swedish. ""Obviously, this level of additional increase would cause further market instability.""
Anthem shares closed up more than 3 percent on Wednesday.

 Anthem to exit Ohio health-care exchange in 2018   
 6:23  PM ET Tue,  6 June 2017 |  01:07 
 A big Obamacare shoe just dropped in Ohio.
 Health insurer Anthem said Tuesday it will effectively exit its Obamacare individual plan business in Ohio, leaving potentially 18 counties in the Buckeye State with no insurer selling plans in 2018.
Anthem, which sells Obamacare plans in 14 states this year, left open the door to dropping out of other states next year.
 The company this year sold individual health plans in all 88 counties in Ohio, the only Obamacare insurer to cover the whole state.
But next year, Anthem said, it will sell just a single plan in Pike County, and that will only be available outside of the Obamacare federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov. 
There are 10,500 current Anthem customers in the 18 counties who are currently not expected to have an Obamacare plan available as a result of Anthem's planned exit, which was revealed a day after the deadline for filing proposed rates in Ohio for next year.
The company, in explaining what it called ""a difficult decision,"" pointed to continued ""volatility"" in the individual health plan market, as well as to uncertainty about whether President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress will continue paying insurers reimbursements for key Obamacare subsidies that reduce low-income customers' out-of-pocket health costs.
The company also blamed the restoration of a tax on insurers.
""An increasing lack of overall predictability simply does not provide a sustainable path forward to provide affordable plan choices for consumers,"" said Anthem. 
""As the Individual marketplace continues to evolve, Anthem will continue to advocate solutions that will stabilize the market to allow us to return to a more robust presence in the future,"" the company said.

 ""We participated in [Obamacare] exchanges in all of our 14 states this year,"" an Anthem spokeswoman said. ""Regulations and deadlines for making the decisions regarding our participation vary by state and we intend to continue our dialog with regulators in our markets until that time.""
The Ohio Department of Insurance said there were 17 companies selling Obamacare plans in the state through the federal marketplace HealthCare.gov in 2016. That dropped to just 11 companies this year. 
Anthem currently is the only Obamacare insurer in the state's 20 counties that have just one insurer. The insurance department said that based on preliminary rate filings for 2018 Anthem's pullback across the state will leave at least 18 counties with no Obamacare insurer next year.
""For the past few years, we have seen a weakening in the federal insurance marketplace as a number of companies have withdrawn from the exchange,"" said Chris Brock, a spokesman for the state's insurance department.
""We have always argued the private insurance market is the most severely impacted by the federal law and that is where congressional action is needed to restore stability.""
""The Department of Insurance is looking for options to help the approximately 10,500 Ohioans in counties where there may not be an exchange plan when this takes effect in 2018,"" Brock said.
Anthem will continue selling small-group and large-group health plans in Ohio, which currently cover about 3.4 million people.
 Gus Ruelas | Reuters
 Alleigh Marré, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said ""This news is heartbreaking for the millions of Ohioans who depend on access to affordable, high-quality healthcare, and this is a stark reminder that Obamacare is collapsing.""
""Now is the time to advance real healthcare reform that empowers individuals and families with the choices and resources they need to buy a plan that meets their healthcare needs without breaking their budgets."" Marré said. ""The American people can't afford to wait any longer.""
Katherine Hempstead, senior advisor at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said, ""The things that Anthem does are very consequential because in a lot of the markets where they are they're the only carrier or one of two, so they have a really big footprint and a really important footprint.""
Hempstead said that Anthem in recent years has more like local Blue Cross operators, maintaining a stronger commitment to the Obamacare exchanges, compared with its national peers like Aetna and Humana, which each announced a big pullback from the exchanges for 2018 earlier this year.
""I'm a little bit surprised at the Ohio decision,"" Hempstead said.
In an analysis earlier this year, Hempstead wrote,  ""Anthem is the most significant [Obamacare] marketplace participant.""
""With plans in 14 states, an Anthem exit would leave nearly 300 counties and about a quarter of a million marketplace enrollees with no carrier, mostly in Georgia, Missouri, and Kentucky,"" she wrote. ""An additional half million consumers residing in 227 other counties would find themselves with only one carrier.""
U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, in a prepared statement said, ""For the past few years we've seen premiums and deductibles skyrocket because of the Obamacare law, as we've seen a declining number of viable health care choices for families and small businesses.""
""Now, with the pullout of Anthem in Ohio, there are at least 20 counties without a single insurer offering health coverage on the Obamacare exchange,"" Portman said. ""And many other counties will have only one insurer, with no competition to get costs down for families. This is a problem not just in Ohio but across the country. Approximately one-third of the counties around the United States now only have one insurer, and more and more counties are seeing their last insurer leave just like those in Ohio.""
""Without true competition and choice in the market, we will never be able to lower health care costs for families and small businesses. This is one more reason why the status quo on health care is unsustainable. The Affordable Care Act has failed to meet the promises that were made to Ohio families,"" he said.
But Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said Anthem's departure is the result of Trump's  ""sabotage"" of Obamacare.
""Democrats believe health care is a right for all. That's why we're fighting every day to protect health care for families in Ohio and across the country,"" Perez said. ""More than 664,000 previously uninsured Ohioans have gained access to affordable health care under Obamacare, and as many as 5 million people with pre-existing conditions could have been denied coverage before the law went into effect. Now, because of Donald Trump and Republicans' efforts to sabotage health insurance markets and play games with the lives of the American people, thousands of families in up to 20 Ohio counties will lose their health insurance.""

 Anthem's CEO told CNBC on Thursday it was a ""complicated decision"" to pull out of Ohio's Obamacare market, but said the model had become unsustainable.
 The health insurer announced earlier this month that it will effectively exit its Obamacare individual plans in the Buckeye State. Anthem, which sells Affordable Care Act plans in 14 states this year, left the door open to dropping out of other states this year.
CEO Joseph Swedish told CNBC the company has repeatedly said that it very carefully evaluated the Obamacare marketplace.
 ""We've also said that it's possible without the right kinds of changes with respect to funding levels and other regulations associated with the Affordable Care Act that we may have to exit certain markets because those markets are not sustainable,"" he said in an interview with ""Closing Bell.""
Because there have been very few adjustments, the operating model has ""deteriorated substantially.""
""Adjustments have not occurred and certain decisions have not been made to further strengthen or stabilize that marketplace. ... [W]e've come to sort of a fork in the road in terms of our inability to service our communities,"" Swedish said.
""Fixing the individual market, fixing the Affordable Care Act and possibly getting to some new model of delivery for the individual marketplace will evolve so that sustainability is created,"" he said.
President Donald Trump has vowed to replace Obamacare. House Republicans passed their health-care bill last month. Now, the Senate is working on its version.

8,2017-06-21,Anthem pulls out of Obamacare markets in Wisconsin and Indiana for 2018  ,"T.J. Kirkpatrick | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Joseph Swedish, chief executive officer of Anthem.
 Big health insurer Anthem — which already had announced plans to effectively depart Ohio's Obamacare market in 2018 — said Wednesday it will almost completely leave Affordable Care Act markets in Wisconsin and Indiana in 2018.
 Anthem, as it did with its Ohio pullout, blamed a ""volatile"" market for individual health plans, as well as ""uncertainty"" about the federal government's stance on Obamacare's rules and regulations.
The insurer also said it was worried about whether the Trump administration will continue paying insurers billions of dollars in reimbursements for subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket health costs to low-income Obamacare customers.
 The administration, with Republican leaders in Congress, is pushing for legislation that could repeal and replace key parts of Obamacare, possibly resulting in millions of people ending their enrollment in individual health plans like those sold by Anthem. Those plans are bought by people who don't have health coverage through a job or elsewhere.
The administration and Congress also have refused to make a long-term guarantee to continue paying insurers the so-called cost-sharing reimbursements to insurers, without which insurers will have to significantly raise their premium prices.
Anthem said Wednesday it will offer just one individual health plan outside of the HealthCare.gov Obamacare marketplace in a single county in Wisconsin, and one such plan also sold outside of that federally run marketplace in five Indiana counties.
By offering those plans, Anthem will avoid a five-year ban on re-entering the individual health plan markets that is imposed on insurers who completely exit a state's Obamacare market.
Anthem currently sells Obamacare plans in 14 states. So far, it has announced plans to almost completely pull out of three of those states in 2018, and it is not clear how many states Anthem may depart.
""After significant dialogue with state leaders and regulators Anthem has made the difficult decision to reduce its 2018 Individual plan offerings in Wisconsin and Indiana,"" the insurer said.
""While we are pleased that some steps have been taken to address the long-term challenges all health plans serving the Individual market are facing, the Individual market remains volatile,"" Anthem said.
""Today, planning and pricing for ACA-compliant health plans has become increasingly difficult due to a shrinking and deteriorating individual market, as well as continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations, rules and guidance, including cost-sharing reduction subsidies and the restoration of taxes on fully insured coverage.""
Anthem's decision Wednesday does not affect the company's business selling employer-based health coverage, Medicare Advantage, or Medicaid plans in Wisconsin or Indiana.
""We will continue to advocate solutions that will stabilize the market and allow us return to a more robust presence in the future,"" Anthem said.
""In those states where Anthem has not yet made a final participation decision, we continue to work with regulators and remain actively engaged in dialogue.""
Larry Levitt, an Obamacare expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said: ""There is no question that Anthem has soured on the marketplace, given underlying instability and the tremendous uncertainty stoked by the Trump administration and the health-care debate in Congress.""
""Assuming other insurers in Indiana and Wisconsin stick around, there will still be at least one insurer in all counties in these states,"" Levitt said.

 A data breach may have exposed personal health information of more than 18,000 Anthem Medicare enrollees, after one of the insurer's health care consulting firms discovered that one of its employees had been involved in identity theft.
 Anthem says it was contacted about the breach by the consulting firm LaunchPoint Ventures on June 14. LaunchPoint discovered two months earlier that one of its employees had been involved in involved in a case of identity theft, and further investigation discovered that the worker had ""emailed a file with information about Anthem companies' members to his personal email address,"" a year ago.
In all, more than 18,500 Anthem Medicare members' Social Security and Medicare identification data may have been exposed. The health insurer reported the breach to the Department of Health and Human services on July 24, the same day LaunchPoint began notifying members, according to an Anthem spokeswoman. 
 Why did it take so long for them to reach out to members?
""Anthem had to work with LaunchPoint to determine if the information contained in the report corresponded to Anthem family health plan members,"" explained Anthem public relations director Gene Rodriguez, adding: ""(We) had to ensure LaunchPoint had accurate address information in order to notify those impacted.""
This is the second major data breach for Anthem in two years. Last month, the health insurer agreed to a $115 million settlement to resolve a class action lawsuit over a 2015 breach that saw hackers gain access to the personal information of nearly 80 million people. That agreement, which must still be approved by a federal judge, would mark a record for a cyber-breach.
In 2013, the company paid $1.7 million to resolve a federal complaint that it exposed protected health information of more than 600,000 people, due to online security failures.
The contractor from LaunchPoint has been ""terminated,"" according to Anthem, and is incarcerated on charges unrelated to the Anthem breach. The company further stated that LaunchPoint is reevaluating its security safeguards.
Individuals' whose data were exposed will be provided with free credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for two years.

""A stable insurance market is dependent on products that create value for consumers through the broad spreading of risk and a known set of conditions upon which rates can be developed.""
Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are required to pay subsidies to low-income consumers. These payments help these consumers offset the cost of premiums and co-payments.

 In the past, insurance companies were reimbursed by the government for these payments, but their fate is uncertain. So far the Trump administration has continued to make these payments, but it can decide against that. 
House Republicans last year successfully challenged the legality of the CSR reimbursements in federal court. The Obama administration appealed that decision and continued to make the payments while that case was being decided. However, under the Trump administration, the government could drop the appeal and halt the reimbursements. 
Insurance companies are also wondering whether or not they will have to pay a tax. Its status is unclear as the president continues to press Congress to repeal and replace the ACA. 
Amid this uncertainty, Anthem said Friday it will only offer off-exchange plans in two counties and one city in Virginia next year. The insurer's decision will not affect people with employer-based insurance, those who purchased insurance before March of 2010 or those enrolled in Medicaid or Medicare plans. 
The company sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states, according to Reuters. 
Virginia is the latest state where Anthem has decided to stop participating in Obamacare markets. Earlier this summer, the insurer announced it will exit Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio next year. It cited ""volatile"" markets and ""uncertainty"" for each decision. 
Last month, Anthem warned it may leave more marketplaces. It has until Sept. 27 to decide if it will exit more.

11,2017-09-06,"Big insurer Anthem slashes Obamacare footprint in Kentucky in half for 2018  This investor sees gold heading to $1,500 a beyond  ","Gus Ruelas | Reuters
 Anthem on Wednesday continued reducing its Obamacare business, as the big insurer said it will cut in half the number of counties in Kentucky where it sells individual health plans next year.
 Anthem's decision to sell individual plans in just 59 counties in Kentucky comes more than two months after the Blue Cross Blue Shield insurer filed proposed rates for health plans in 2018 for all 120 counties in the state.
So far, Anthem has announced that it will significantly reduce its Obamacare footprint next year in nine out of the 14 states where it currently sells individual health plans both on and outside of government-run marketplaces.
 The pullbacks do not affect Anthem's business selling group insurance or Medicaid Advantage and Medicaid plans in those states.
The insurer, as it has done with previously announced pullbacks from Obamacare marketplaces in other states, on Wednesday cited an individual health plan market that ""remains volatile"" as it disclosed its cuts in Kentucky.
""Today, planning and pricing for [Affordable Care Act]-compliant health plans has become increasingly difficult due to a shrinking and deteriorating individual market,"" Anthem said.
Anthem also blamed uncertainty over whether insurers will be guaranteed payments by the federal government that compensate them for offering lower-income Obamacare customers discounts on out-of-pocket health costs. 
The Trump administration has threatened to end those cost-sharing reduction payments.
The Senate Health Committee on Wednesday held the first of four planned hearings on a proposed bipartisan bill that would continue to fund the CSR payments to insurers, which are estimated to be worth $10 billion next year.
Kentucky's Department of Insurance, when asked about Anthem's pullback in the state, said the department had ""proactively engaged [the insurer] CareSource and Anthem to ensure that every county in Kentucky would be covered during benefit year 2018.""
""Despite the volatility in the healthcare marketplace precipitated by Obamacare, the department is committed to the best outcome for Kentuckians.""
CareSource will cover the counties in Kentucky that Anthem is not covering.
Anthem in June said it would not sell Obamacare plans in nearly all of Ohio, Wisconsin and Indiana in 2017. In August, Anthem said it was also effectively pulling out of Nevada's individual health plan market.
The insurer also has announced less-dramatic pullbacks in selling Obamacare plans in California, Missouri, Georgia, and Virginia next year.

12,2017-09-15,"Big insurer Anthem agrees to sell Obamacare plans in part of Virginia, ending risk of 'bare counties'  ","T.J. Kirkpatrick | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Joseph Swedish, chief executive officer of Anthem.
 The health insurer Anthem on Friday agreed to sell Obamacare plans next year in the parts of Virginia that were at risk of having no insurers there.
 Anthem's move means that there are currently not any parts of the United States that lack at least one insurer willing to sell individual market health plans in 2018.
Last week, Virginia officials said there were 48 counties and 15 cities in that state expected to be bare as a result of Optima Health's decision not to expand its footprint as much as it had earlier expected.
 Anthem had announced in August that it would stop selling its Blue Cross Blue Shield Obamacare plans in all of Virginia. Two other large insurers, Aetna and UnitedHealthcare, previously said they would exit the Obamacare market there.
Gov. Terry McAuliffe said that Anthem's partial reversal of its decision to leave the state would save lives.
 Tweet
 Anthem in a statement said its ""decision will positively impact up to 70,000 Virginians—many of whom would not have had access to important health care coverage.""
""Anthem will remain focused on developments in the individual marketplace and will continue to advocate for solutions that will stabilize the market and allow us to once again offer individual insurance coverage throughout the state of Virginia in the future,"" the company said.
However, to date Anthem overall has announced plans to significantly scale back its Obamacare business in 2018 in nine of the 14 states where it currently sells such individual market plans.
Earlier this week, however, the company said it will continue to sell individual plans in all of Connecticut.

 Sen. Pat Toomey on NFL anthem protests: I think they ought to be standing   
 10:04  AM ET Wed, 27 Sept 2017 |  00:56 
 NFL players and other professional athletes should stand for the national anthem to show their respect for the Americans who make sacrifices to help keep the U.S. safe, secure, and prosperous, Sen. Pat Toomey told CNBC on Wednesday.
 ""They have every right to protest as they see fit. But I think it's totally inappropriate. What they ought to do is show their respect for the people who helped secure the country that they have,""  the Pennsylvania Republican said.
Asked his opinion about the polarizing player protests of taking a knee during ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" before games, Toomey said he believes ""they ought to be standing,"" siding with President Donald Trump who's been tweeting since the weekend about the issue, saying players who don't stand should be fired.
 Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country!
 On Monday Night Football, the Cowboys, including owner Jerry Jones, knelt before the national anthem in solidarity with the hundreds of players who took a knee over the weekend. But when the anthem started, the players on Dallas and the Arizona Cardinals were standing arm in arm. Jones has been vocal in the past against protesting during the anthem.
Toomey said in a ""Squawk Box"" interview, ""This country has offered so many millions of people so many wonderful opportunities; and quite especially, the players on the field who are multimillionaires because they're really good at playing a game.""
Pennsylvania, Toomey's state, is one of a handful of states that have two NFL franchises: the Philadelphia Eagles and the Pittsburgh Steelers.

 All of the Steelers stayed in the locker room during the national anthem on Sunday except for left tackle Alejandro Villanueva, a former Army Ranger who served three tours in Afghanistan. Villanueva stood outside the tunnel with his hand over his heart during the anthem.
The Eagles on Sunday — players, coaches, executives and owner Jeffrey Lurie — locked arms during the anthem.
The kneeling protests started last season when then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first knelt to protest police brutality and racial injustice. Kaepernick opted out of his contract in March. He's a free agent, but has not been signed.
Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, told CNBC in a separate interview on Wednesday NFL players should not protest during the national anthem.
""Every man, woman, child in this country should stand for the national anthem. That should go without question,"" the South Carolina senator said.
While he does not agree with the form of the protest, Senator Scott said Americans should ask themselves why the players are kneeling.

 Sen. Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, told CNBC on Wednesday that NFL players should not protest during the national anthem.
 ""Every man, woman, child in this country should stand for the national anthem. That should go without question,"" the South Carolina senator said.
Although Scott didn't agree with the form of protest, he said Americans should ask themselves why the players are kneeling.
 ""If we were able to reinforce the fact that we all should stand and delve into the challenges that have some players kneeling, we'll be in a better place as a country,"" he said in an interview on ""Squawk Box."" ""We should all seek for unity and equality in this nation.""
President Donald Trump has been tweeting about the issue and said players who don't stand should be fired.
The firestorm started when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the national anthem last season to protest the treatment of African-Americans in the United States. He is no longer in the NFL.
On Monday night, the Dallas Cowboys, including owner Jerry Jones, knelt before the singing of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" in solidarity with the hundreds players who took a knee over the weekend after Trump's remarks. But when the national anthem started, the Dallas and Arizona Cardinal players stood arm in arm.
Scott said the Cowboys did a ""good job"" in finding a way to be clear in their support of the challenges in this country while respecting the anthem.
In a separate CNBC interview on Wednesday, Sen. Pat Toomey, Republican from Pennsylvania, said NFL players have the right to protest. ""But I think it's totally inappropriate.""
""What they ought to do is show their respect for the people who helped secure the country that they have,"" he added.

After the meeting, Scott told reporters he was ""encouraged and surprised"" by Trump, who listened more than he talked. But Scott also criticized Trump for assigning blame in a way that put white supremacist protesters on equal footing with counterdemonstrators.
Scott added Wednesday that the country has evolved over the last 50 to 60 years. It's now ""un-American to be racist,"" he said.

 Anthem won't sell new Obamacare plans in most of Maine   
 6:06  PM ET Wed, 27 Sept 2017 |  00:47 
 Big health insurer Anthem said Wednesday that it won't sell Obamacare plans to new customers in most of Maine in 2018 — and current customers will lose federal aid that reduces coverage costs if they stick with Anthem.
 The company as it has done in announcing departures from a number of other states' individual health plan markets in recent months, cited a ""volatile"" individual market that is ""shrinking and deteriorating.""
Anthem also pointed to the ""continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations"" ever since the Trump administration assumed oversight of Obamacare, a program that the White House strongly opposes.
 One of the biggest sources of uncertainty is the Trump administration's refusal to guarantee permanent continuation of billions of dollars worth of reimbursements to insurers for discounts that insurers must offer many Obamacare customers by law.
Anthem's decision, which came on the day of the deadline for insurers to sign contracts for Obamacare plans in 2018, will leave Maine with just two insurers selling plans widely when open enrollment starts Nov. 1.
The company has been selling such plans statewide to people who do not get health coverage through a job, Medicare, Medicaid or other source.
Anthem said it will not sell new customers plans next year through HealthCare.gov, the federally run Obamacare exchange that serves Maine and most other states.
The insurer also won't sell almost all of the plans it now sells outside of that exchange in Maine. Anthem will continue offering employer-based health coverage.
Low- and middle-income people who buy individual health plans can get federal subsidies to reduce both their monthly premiums and out-of-pocket health costs only if they buy coverage through HealthCare.gov or a state-run Obamacare marketplace. People who buy coverage off-exchange cannot get such financial aid.
Most of the more than 79,000 Maine residents who signed up for a plan from Anthem and two other insurers selling coverage through HealthCare.gov this year qualified for such aid.
Maine has a guaranteed renewal law that mandates customers be allowed to renew with their current insurer if that insurer is not completely exiting a market.
That will allow the 28,700 or so current Anthem customers who now buy plans via HealthCare.gov to keep their existing coverage in 2018.
""But these plans will be offered off-exchange, and they will not be eligible to receive financial assistance or subsidies,"" Anthem said in a prepared statement.
CNBC has asked Anthem whether the decision to offer solely off-exchange plans next year was the company's, or whether it was due to a regulatory constraint. A spokeswoman said she was looking into that question.
In addition to allowing existing customers to renew their coverage, albeit off-exchange, Anthem will sell just a single ""gold-level"" plan off of the federal exchange in only three counties. Gold plans cover, on average, 80 percent of their customers' medical costs, with individuals being responsible for the remaining share.
By maintaining a small toehold in Maine's individual health plan market, Anthem will keep open the option of returning to that market on a wide scale in 2019. If it did not keep that minimal presence, the insurer would be blocked from returning to the Obamacare market for five years.
Anthem said it will monitor changes in the individual market, and ""We will reevaluate whether a more robust presence in the exchange is appropriate in the future.""
The company in the past several months has announced full-scale or partial departures from Obamacare markets next year in California, Georgia, Missouri, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Nevada and Virginia.
In its statement about Maine, Anthem said, ""While we are pleased that some steps have been taken to address the long term challenges all health plans serving the individual market are facing, the market remains volatile.""
""A stable insurance market is dependent on products that create value for consumers through the broad spreading of risk and a known set of conditions upon which rates can be developed,"" the insurer said.
""Today, planning and pricing for ACA-compliant health plans has become increasingly difficult due to a shrinking and deteriorating individual market, as well as continual changes and uncertainty in federal operations, rules and guidance, including the restoration of the health insurance tax on fully insured coverage and continued uncertainty around the future of cost sharing reduction subsidies.""

 Facebook, Google, Twitter asked to testify on Russian meddling   
 9:07  AM ET Thu, 28 Sept 2017 |  00:59 
 After a weekend when Americans took to social media to debate President Trump's admonishment of N.F.L. players who do not stand for the national anthem, a network of Twitter accounts suspected of links to Russia seized on both sides of the issue with hashtags such as #boycottnfl, #standforouranthem and #takeaknee.
As Twitter prepared to brief staff members of the Senate and House intelligence committees on Thursday for their investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, researchers from a public policy group have been following hundreds of accounts to track the continuing Russian operations to influence social media discourse and foment division in the United States.
For three weeks, a  harsh spotlight has been trained on Facebook over its disclosure that  Russians used fake pages and ads, designed to look like the work of American activists, to spread inflammatory messages during and since the presidential campaign.
 But there is evidence that Twitter may have been used even more extensively than Facebook in the Russian influence campaign last year. In addition to Russia-linked Twitter accounts that posed as Americans, the platform was also used for large-scale automated messaging, using ""bot"" accounts to spread false stories and promote news articles about emails from Democratic operatives that had been obtained by Russian hackers.
Twitter has struggled for years to rein in the fake accounts overrunning its platform. Unlike Facebook, the service does not require its users to provide their real name (or at least a facsimile of one) and allows automated accounts — arguing that they are a useful tool for tasks such as customer service.
Beyond those restrictions, there is also an online black market for services that can allow for the creation of large numbers of Twitter bots, which can be controlled by a single person while still being difficult to distinguish from real accounts.
Since last month, researchers at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a bipartisan initiative of the German Marshall Fund, a public policy research group in Washington, have been publicly tracking 600 Twitter accounts — human users and suspected bots alike — they have linked to Russian influence operations. Those were the accounts pushing the opposing messages on the N.F.L. and the national anthem.

Members of the Detroit Lions take a knee during the playing of the national anthem prior to the start of the game against the Atlanta Falcons at Ford Field on September 24, 2017 in Detroit, Michigan.
 Of 80 news stories promoted last week by those accounts, more than 25 percent ""had a primary theme of anti-Americanism,"" the researchers found. About 15 percent were critical of Hillary Clinton, falsely accusing her of funding left-wing antifa — short for anti-fascist — protesters, tying her to the lethal terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 and discussing her daughter Chelsea's use of Twitter. Eleven percent focused on wiretapping in the federal investigation into Paul Manafort, President Trump's former campaign chairman, with most of them treated the news as a vindication for President Trump's earlier wiretapping claims.
In the face of such public scrutiny, Twitter has said almost nothing about what it knows about Russia's use of its platform. But Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he would like to know exactly what the company has done to find covert Russian activity and what it has discovered so far about fake accounts — including their reach and impact.
""I think right now the public is aware of only a subset of a subset of Russian activity online,"" Mr. Schiff said in an interview. He said Facebook long denied that there had been Russian exploitation of its system, before reversing course on Sept. 6.
Mr. Schiff said the tech companies have asked for assistance from American intelligence agencies in trying to find and stop illicit interference from other countries, a request he said he supports.

 The House Intelligence Committee announced on Wednesday that it would hold a public hearing on the matter of Russian influence next month, and a Senate aide said Facebook, Twitter and Google have been invited to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1.
This month, The New York Times reported on evidence of  Russian operators creating hundreds or thousands of fake Twitter accounts to flood the network with anti-Clinton messages during the campaign. The cybersecurity company FireEye identified what it called ""warlists"" of accounts linked to Russian intelligence that sometimes spewed messages like #WarAgainstDemocrats several times a minute.
Both DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, which spread the leaked emails and documents and were identified as having been created by Russian intelligence, used accounts that Twitter has not suspended, though they have been dormant for months. In some cases, the Russian exploitation of Facebook and Twitter was linked: ""Heart of Texas,"" a Facebook page advocating the secession of Texas that was identified as one of 470 fake profiles and pages linked to Russia, also had a Twitter feed — now suspended — called @itstimetosecede.
Experts on Russia inside and outside the government say President Vladimir V. Putin had multiple goals in last year's campaign of hacking, leaking and stealth propaganda. He hoped to damage, if not defeat, Mrs. Clinton, whom he blamed for encouraging pro-democracy protests in Russia and neighboring states.
But Mr. Putin also sought to darken the image of the United States, making it a less attractive model for other countries and reducing its international influence, said Mark R. Jacobson, a Georgetown professor and co-author of  a new report on Russian influence operations.
Last week, Facebook said it was turning over more than 3,000 Russia-linked ads to Congress. Many of those ads, like the opposing Twitter hashtags on the N.F.L. anthem issue, targeted divisions in American society by simultaneously sending conflicting messages to different users segmented by political and racial characteristics.

 Trump: I think the NFL is in a 'very bad box'   
 1:48  PM ET Wed, 27 Sept 2017 |  00:42 
 ""What we see over and over again is that a lot of the messaging isn't about politics, a specific politician, or political parties,"" said Laura Rosenberger, director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy. ""It's about creating societal division, identifying divisive issues and fanning the flames.""
Her group's web ""dashboard"" is called Hamilton 68. It is named for No. 68 of the Federalist Papers, believed to have been written by Alexander Hamilton, which warns of foreign meddling in American elections. The tool does not identify the activity of specific Twitter users but highlights the activity of the 600 accounts that researchers believe are either tied to the Russian government or repeat the themes of its propaganda.
For its part, Twitter has not said much about what it plans to say in the Congressional briefing.
""Twitter deeply respects the integrity of the election process, a cornerstone of all democracies, and will continue to strengthen our platform against bots and other forms of manipulation that violate our Terms of Service,"" Twitter said in a statement.
Twitter has also said it was working to crack down on bots that distribute tweets en masse or that attempt to manipulate the platform's trending topics.
Colin Crowell, Twitter's vice president of public policy, government and philanthropy, said in a blog post in June that the company should not be an arbiter of whether a tweet is truthful or not.
Because Twitter is open and real-time, he said the platform is the best antidote to misinformation, when ""journalists, experts and engaged citizens Tweet side-by-side correcting and challenging public discourse in seconds.""
Karen North, a social media professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, said the company's defense has some merit.
""Twitter functions more like a broadcast network,"" she said. ""People say things and everyone can hear it. When false information is stated, people can jump on false statements and challenge it.""

 Should NFL owners fire players who sit or kneel in protest during the national anthem?   
 7:33  PM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 |  02:18 
 Americans by a two-to-one margin say NFL players should not be fired or suspended when they kneel during the national anthem, according to the third-quarter CNBC All-American Economic Survey.
 The results show President Donald Trump, who called publicly for the firing or suspending of such players, at odds with a strong majority of the public.
""This was a ridiculous and totally unhelpful thing for him to do. Absolutely no upside,'' said Jay Campbell, pollster with Hart Research and the Democratic half of the CNBC polling team.
 Micah Roberts of Public Opinion Strategies, who serves as the Republican pollster, noted that half of Trump's own supporters disagree with his stance.
The poll was conducted earlier this week during two of the three days the poll was in the field. It includes responses from about 600 people across the country and has a margin of error of 4 percent. The full poll, which includes responses from 800 individuals, has a margin of error of 3.5 percent and will be released Monday.
 The poll found 61 percent saying the players should not be fired, 27 percent saying they should be, and 12 percent unsure. Strong support for the players came from Democrats and Independents. Republicans sided with the president by only a 47 to 39 margin, or substantially below their overall level of support for the president.
Respondents in the Northeast and the South equally backed the players at around the national average of 60 percent. But support among those with incomes greater than $75,000 was twice as high as among those with incomes from $30,000 to $50,000. And net support (the percent supporting the players minus opposition) was 60 percent among non-whites but just 23 percent among whites.

 The NFL will discuss at an upcoming meeting the nationwide dispute over whether players must stand during the national anthem, Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a copy of a memo obtained by CNBC.
 In the memo sent to NFL teams, Goodell said that the league must ""move past this controversy"" and that this has to be done in collaboration with its players.
""Building on many discussions with clubs and players, we have worked to develop a plan that we will review with you at next week's League meeting,"" Goodell said in the Tuesday memo.
 While he said the plan would include continued dialogue and promoting the work of its players on key issues, Goodell didn't provide further details on what that proposed plan would entail.
The NFL comissioner said that the league believes everyone should stand for the national anthem. Goodell said the NFL cares about its players and values their opinions on key social issues.

 Since last season, primarily black professional football players have knelt during the national anthem to protest racial inequality in the United States. The protests started after former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick last year began kneeling during the anthem to protest police mistreatment of black Americans.
Earlier Tuesday, President Donald Trump tweeted that tax laws should be changed so that the NFL doesn't get ""massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country.""

 In September, the president renewed discussion about the protests when he urged owners to ""fire"" the ""son of a bitch"" who kneels during the anthem.
Later Tuesday, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the White House ""would certainly support the NFL coming out and asking the players to stand"" during the National Anthem. She said the administration is glad to see the NFL ""take positive steps in that direction.""

 The NFL's brand has been ""clearly damaged"" over the controversy of players protesting during the national anthem, ad executive Harris Diamond said Wednesday.
 Fans are annoyed by the political back-and-forth between President Donald Trump and the NFL players, and ""that is a problem,"" said Diamond, CEO of McCann Worldgroup, the world's No. 2 ad agency.
""They obviously have to quiet it down,"" Diamond told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""The NFL's clearly been damaged. There's no doubt about it.""
 ""At the end of the day, they need their players to believe that their teams believe in them. And this is obviously something that's heartfelt, it's emotional, it goes beyond business issues,"" he added.
At an upcoming meeting, the league will discuss the nationwide dispute over whether players must stand during the national anthem, Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a copy of a memo obtained by CNBC.
Diamond didn't say whether there was an ""artful"" way for the NFL to get past the controversy but said that at least ""time heals all wounds."" ""I do think that time will actually heal this,"" Diamond said. ""But the reality is we actually have to get beyond this.""
The firestorm started when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled during the national anthem last season to protest the treatment of African-Americans in the United States. 
Trump later began tweeting about the issue and said players who don't stand should be fired.
Earlier Tuesday, Trump tweeted that tax laws should be changed so that the NFL doesn't get ""massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country.""

22,2017-10-13,NFL owners' proposed crackdown on anthem protests will create new problems  NFL players may have an ally in their protests: labor law  ,"Matt York | AP
The Dallas Cowboys, led by owner Jerry Jones, center, take a knee prior to the national anthem prior to an NFL football game against the Arizona Cardinals, Monday, Sept. 25, 2017, in Glendale, Ariz.
 NFL players who squared off against President Trump by staging widespread  silent protests may now find themselves locked in a new battle – this time, against the NFL owners who are considering a  rule that would make standing for the national anthem mandatory.
 NFL owners, who previously joined the #takeaknee movement and locked arms with players as an act of apparent solidarity against racial injustice, appear ready to reverse that stance. Instead, they seem eager to appease Trump who has upped the ante in the sidelines protests, suggesting the use of  tax laws to penalize the NFL over the issue. This latest threat from the Trump administration is an escalation of the president's earlier ""tough talk"" tweets, cursing protesting players and calling for them to be  fired or suspended.
Now, the possibility of NFL owners imposing a rule on players shows just how hypocritical the league is being. Instead of seizing the opportunity – if not a responsibility – to clarify and demonstrate the seriousness of its stand against racial injustice, the league is showing that its number one priority is money.
 Clearly it is not, as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suggested in his  letter to the teams, a way to find a uniform approach to addressing the ""controversy"" over the national anthem. It is the clash between social justice and economic interests. If NFL owners proceed with an anthem rule that compels players to stand, rather than act in accordance with their own conscience, it will only cause more division – not unity.
 ""Given that the majority of NFL players are African American, it is impossible in today's racially charged and politically divided landscape to expect players to stick to the game and be silent on important matters in the public square.""
 NFL owners reportedly will meet  next week in New York, during which the anthem protests are expected to be discussed. But this is no ordinary rule governing player conduct, such as how exuberantly they can celebrate a  touchdown. The NFL owners need to recognize that the psychological safety and wellbeing of their players is just as important to their economic interests as federal tax incentives. Without that recognition, there won't be any progress.
White men telling black men what they can and cannot say – that they should be grateful to have a paycheck, and not to use their platform and voice to express their opinion – is an irony, to say the least.
Taking a knee during the national anthem is just as much of a political statement as playing the anthem in the first place – an anthem which mentions slavery and was written by an anti-abolitionist. While many in the NFL (and in corporate America), such as Dallas Cowboys owner  Jerry Jones believe that politicized self-expression should not interfere with making money, it must be noted that the very NFL enterprise is politicized, as  recent research revealed a connection between NFL owners' donations to Trump and the lack of black executives on the team staff.
Given that the majority of NFL players are African American, it is impossible in today's racially charged and politically divided landscape to expect players to stick to the game and be silent on important matters in the public square. Being well-paid for their labor does not require them to relinquish their right to express themselves – in fact, it gives them a greater platform with greater influence that can be stewarded for the greater good.
If the league's priority is truly healing, then it needs to look within at its own policies and practices. Specifically, the NFL needs to address the fact that there are very few black coaches and no black owners in its franchises. Sports is big business, involving not only multi-billion-dollar franchises but also lucrative marketing and advertising deals. For such any business to have such blatant racial inequality is intolerable.
Now the NFL is putting into question everything it stands for as an organization. If owners try to impose a rule requiring players to stand during the anthem, what will be the consequence for those who do not comply? Given the emotional nature of the issue, it seems highly likely that at least some players will continue to protest in some fashion.  Jones of the Dallas Cowboys has pledged to bench players who won't stand for the anthem. But what if —hypothetically speaking — every player refused to stand for the anthem? Would games be forfeited? The season be preempted?
It's time for the NFL to decide where it stands. Calls for unity, statements in favor of diversity, and photo ops highlighting moments of interracial cooperation may play well for the TV cameras and the general public. But a rule that would force players to stand for the anthem only serves to turn up the volume on the centuries-old din of structural racism and inequality in America.

The Cleveland Browns team stand and kneel during the National Anthem before the start of their game against the Indianapolis Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium, September 24, 2017.
 As National Football League team owners consider President Trump's call to fire players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, they have stumbled into one of the most consequential debates in today's workplace: How far can workers go in banding together to address problems related to their employment?
In principle, the answer in the N.F.L. and elsewhere may be: Quite far.
 To the extent that most people think about the reach of federal labor law, they probably imagine a union context — like organizing workers, or bargaining as a group across the table from management.

As it happens, the law is much more expansive, protecting any ""concerted activities"" that employees engage in to support one another in the workplace, whether or not a union is involved. The National Labor Relations Board and the courts have defined such activity to include everything from airing complaints about one's boss through social media to publicly supporting political causes that have some bearing on one's work life.
The league's operations manual says players must be on the sidelines during the anthem and should stand. While the law might not bear on whether an individual player can kneel during the anthem, many experts say it could protect players from repercussions for making such a gesture together — or taking other action — to show solidarity on the job.
And as unionization continues its decades-long decline, some believe that these alternative forms of taking collective action may be crucial to enabling workers to speak up.
""Workers without a traditional organization that is meant to protect them at work are kind of scrambling around for new ways of protecting themselves,"" said Benjamin Sachs, a labor law professor at Harvard University. ""It does feel like these are nascent forms of something new.""
To be protected under federal labor law, an employee's action must be conducted in concert with co-workers, it must address an issue of relevance to their job, and it must be carried out using appropriate means. Workers can't, say, damage property or threaten violence. (If the workers have a collective bargaining agreement with their employer that forbids certain actions — like striking — they can't do that, either.)
Many experts believe that some of the recent protests by N.F.L. players meet all three conditions, and that as a result, their teams cannot discipline or fire them for taking part.
These experts point to a 1978 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that workers have a right to engage in political advocacy as long as the political theme relates to their job. In 2008, the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, which enforces federal labor law,  issued a guidance making clear that workers had a right to publicly demonstrate for or against immigration legislation pending in Congress, though they didn't have the right to skip work to do so.
More recently, the Obama-era labor board appeared to bless a relatively informal definition of the term ""concerted activities,"" so that spontaneous banter, and not just well-orchestrated action like a formal protest, could qualify as protected.
For example, the board ruled that two employees of a sports bar had been improperly fired after one complained on Facebook that their boss had mishandled their tax withholdings and another ""liked"" a former employee's Facebook complaint. In another case, the board ruled that an employer couldn't fire five workers who had gone on Facebook to object to criticism of their work by a sixth employee.
Together, said Matthew Bodie, a law professor at St. Louis University who is a former attorney for the labor board, these precedents suggest that federal labor law would most likely protect collective protests of the president's argument that players should be fired over political gestures — or his suggestion that league rules designed to protect players from debilitating injury are too strict.
Mr. Bodie added that a player was also likely to enjoy federal protection for any protest in support of other players who had been disciplined.
""If they're standing up for other players' rights to kneel in the context of their job and keep their job, it seems to me to be protected concerted activity,"" Mr. Bodie said.
Michael J. Lotito, a lawyer with the management-side firm Littler Mendelson, agreed that players who protested Mr. Trump's efforts to stifle their colleagues' political gestures could be engaging in protected activity. But he argued that under the law, which he said the Obama-era labor board had interpreted too broadly, the activity would have to entail more than kneeling during the national anthem.
He said players would need a more overt connection to their cause, like passing out, to other players, fliers that took issue with the president's meddling in their workplace.
Mr. Lotito also said the players' collective bargaining agreement with the owners could lawfully prohibit these sorts of protests. But Michael LeRoy, who teaches sports law at the University of Illinois, said the league's bargaining agreement was somewhat ambiguous on the question of protests with a political dimension.
The N.F.L. and its players association did not respond to requests for comment.
Experts said the ""concerted activity"" right could be even more profound in workplaces, unlike the N.F.L., where employees aren't unionized and, therefore, have fewer tools for challenging their employers.
""People naturally have complaints, and they don't go away just because you kill unions,"" said Wilma B. Liebman, a former chairwoman of the labor board during the Obama administration.
Mr. Sachs of Harvard pointed to  a case involving a group of employees for a Washington State construction contractor, some of whom produced and publicly released a YouTube video complaining that they were being forced to handle contaminated soil without proper training. The labor board issued a complaint against the company for firing the workers, and the company ultimately settled.
Even James Damore, the Google engineer recently  fired for internally sharing a memo about the company's diversity policies that many found offensive, could credibly claim that federal labor law protected his actions,  according to Mr. Bodie. To do so, Mr. Damore would have to demonstrate that he had been seeking to enlist his co-workers in questioning the policies, as he has  since suggested was his goal.
The Trump administration appears to take a dim view of workers' rights to band together outside traditional union activities. Beyond the president's forays into the N.F.L. controversy, his administration took the  unusual stepof reversing the government's position in a worker-rights case pending before the Supreme Court.
The court, which  heard the argument in the case last week, must decide how strong a right workers have to band together to sue employers over workplace concerns, like wage theft or safety lapses, or initiate collective arbitration proceedings to address these issues. Courts have generally acknowledged that federal labor law protects workers' rights to bring class-action cases, but there is debate about whether employers can require workers to waive that right through their employment contracts. The Trump administration argues that they can do so.
With a conservative majority on the Supreme Court and a Republican majority on the labor board, federal law is likely to move in this direction.
Even so, there is probably no reversing the trend of employees' piping up en masse in the workplace. ""People's instinct, whether you know the word 'solidarity' or not, is to look for people to join you,"" said Ms. Liebman, the former board chairman. ""The growth of social media, Twitter, different avenues for expressing solidarity, is kind of remarkable.""

 Fmr. NBA Commissioner: NFL controversy is a distraction   
 6:51  PM ET Wed, 18 Oct 2017 |  02:10 
 The debate over taking a knee during the national anthem is a distraction from ""what's really happening"" in the U.S., former NBA commissioner David Stern told CNBC on Wednesday.
 Some NFL players, sparked by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, have been kneeling during the national anthem to draw attention to race relations.
President Donald Trump has fired back at these protests, labeling them a ""total disrespect for our great country,"" among other things, and has called publicly for the firing or suspending of such players.
 Trump tweet
 Trump tweet 2
 ""This whole thing is a distraction,"" Stern said on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" ""And what it's distracting from is the fact that Puerto Rico is ravaged, we've got a horrible situation with fire [in California] and flood [in Puerto Rico], and we've got our national parks that are being opened up to drilling and to mining and to commercial exploitation."" 
""Everyone takes the bait of the president throwing this junk out to distract them from what's really happening in this country,"" he said. ""The country is in a dire state, and we're here talking about a football player that took a knee. … It's a nonissue except for the president's tweets.""
 If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....
 ...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!
 Stern isn't the only one who disagrees with the President.
According to the third-quarter CNBC All-American Economic Survey, Americans by a 2-to-1 margin say NFL players should not be fired or suspended when they kneel during the national anthem.
Micah Roberts of Public Opinion Strategies, who serves as the Republican pollster, noted that half of Trump's own supporters disagree with his stance.
During a public appearance in England, Hillary Clinton also reportedly defended the players' right to demonstrate against racial injustice, saying their action does not go against the national anthem or the American flag.
The NFL has decided it will not stop its players from kneeling during the national anthem, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Tuesday.

 6:24  PM ET Wed, 18 Oct 2017 |  03:50 
 The NFL believes ""everyone should stand for the national anthem,"" league Commissioner Roger Goodell said at a press conference on Wednesday. 
 Responding to a series of questions about pro football players' protests, Goodell said that while only ""about a half a dozen players"" continue to kneel for the national anthem, ""we're going to continue to work to try to put that at zero.""
Goodell said that he ""didn't discuss"" whether NFL teams would or would not discipline players who continued to kneel. He also said he has not spoken with President Donald Trump about the protests.
 In recent weeks, professional football stadiums have become battlegrounds for a heated culture war centered around ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""

 Players and coaches knelt during the anthem, as much in opposition of President Trump's criticism as in support of political change. Politicians joined the fray, and  #TakeAKnee became a trending hashtag on social media. 
Trump has accused players who kneel for the anthem of disrespecting the military, and has called for the NFL to censure the protests at rallies and in tweets.
On Wednesday morning, Trump again attacked the NFL over the protests. ""The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem,"" he said. ""Total disrespect for our great country!""
 Trump tweet
 Goodell, while maintaining that players should stand for the anthem, said the NFL is not looking to become a political organization.
""What we're trying to do is stay out of politics,"" he said.
On the game itself, Goodell was asked about the prevalence of the degenerative brain disease CTE in NFL players. The issue of brain damage now forms the basis of a lawsuit against the league by the family of Aaron Hernandez, a former pro player convicted for murder who ultimately committed suicide in prison.
""I think there's been a great deal of focus on this issue of brain trauma,"" Goodell said. ""We'll let the lawyers handle that and deal with it.""

 One of Electronic Arts' key games slated for this year is getting moved out to 2019, according to a gaming news site report.
 Kotaku's Jason Schreier said ""Anthem,"" which was slated for a fall of 2018 release is now planned for a launch in early 2019, according to three people familiar with the project.
The company's shares closed 2.6 percent lower following the report.
 The ""Anthem"" news comes after the controversial Electronic Arts' ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" release last November. Gamers revolted over the title's initial in-game money-making plans, which forced EA to temporarily turning off all in-game purchases a day before its official launch.
One Wall Street analyst downplayed the impact of a potential delay Wednesday.
The Kotaku report ""would imply that the game release would still fall in its FY19. All else equal, this likely wouldn't have a massive impact to estimates; it raises further concerns about the production of the game if it gets pushed a second time,"" KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Evan Wingren wrote in a note to clients. ""These concerns are likely to be amplified given the recent execution concerns.""
The analyst predicts ""Anthem"" will sell 9 million units for the game publisher. 
EA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

32,2018-01-31,Anthem earnings beat lifts health insurer stocks  ,"Gus Ruelas | Reuters
 Better-than-expected earnings from Anthem helped lift shares of health insurers Wednesday, one day after investors were spooked by a new initiative from Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan to combat rising employer health-care costs.
 Anthem shares rose to a historic high of $267.95, after the health insurer reported fourth-quarter profits of $1.29 per share, 2 cents above the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. Revenue of $22.45 billion also topped expectations. Anthem closed Wednesday at $247.85, up 1.8 percent. 
Among the highlights of the quarter, Anthem's Affordable Care Act exchange business produced a surprise profit for 2017, despite an uptick in flu cases late last year.
 ""The claims experienced in our Individual ACA-compliant business was better-than-expected during the fourth quarter,"" said CEO Gail Boudreaux on the company's earnings call. ""As a result, our business was slightly profitable during the year, better than the relatively breakeven performance we had expected.""  The nation's second largest insurer pulled back sharply from the Obamacare exchanges for 2018, citing market upheaval and potential losses, and it still expects its exchange membership to decline by 70 percent.
Anthem raised its profit forecast for 2018, saying it now expects to earn more than $15.00 per share, attributing $2.00 per share to tax reform. The company says it plans to return half of the windfall to shareholders, another 25 percent to members in the form of rebates, and reinvest another 25 percent into the business.
While the subject of the new Amazon-led alliance never came up during the earnings call, Boudreaux said technology will be among the key areas of investments – something the tech giant and its partners emphasized that they want in order to simplify insurance benefits for their employees.
""We're investing in new digital and mobile capabilities to drive greater automation and enhance our consumer experience,"" said Boudreaux, who noted that the company had gained market share in the large employer market this year. ""This includes developing new external-facing applications and portals that will make it easier for members, agents and care providers to conduct business with Anthem.""
Shares of the major insurers, which sell plans to large employers fell more than 4 percent on average Tuesday, in the wake of the Amazon-Berkshire-JP Morgan announcement.
Analysts at Evercore ISI said they don't expect the new three-company venture will pose as big a threat to insurers as some investors feared, writing in a note to clients ""it is unlikely to cut them out completely or end up competing with them directly given barriers to forming national provider networks and industry's ongoing vertical consolidation – and instead any new solutions could complement or even be developed in partnership with (insurers).""
Even with Tuesday's pullback, the health insurance sector gained more than 7 percent for the month of January, the best start to the year for the major insurers since 2011.
