0,2017-07-06,Wells Fargo: buy these retailers that have gotten “too cheap”  ,"Retail's had a rough run this year, with the XRT down eight percent year-to-date.
 With the sector under pressure, Wells Fargo's senior research analyst, Ike Boruchow, says now's the time to buy some of the names that ""have simply gotten too cheap.""

 Wells Fargo: possible upside in ""too cheap"" retail names   
 1:46  PM ET Wed,  5 July 2017 |  05:44 
 He notes that they're not ""fundamental bulls on the group,"" but that names such as PVH, HanesBrands, Signet Jewelers, L Brands, Sally Beauty Holdings, and Ralph Lauren have been selling off, and now show potential upside for the second quarter.
 Boruchow argues that as retail stocks begin to stabilize, investors will ""flock back"" to the increasingly cheap names.

 ""There were a lot of headwinds in Q1 around late Easter weather and tax refunds that caused a lot of volatility for those businesses but when we look at our group, the setup in the Q2 is much more favorable,"" he said.
Of the six names, Boruchow names PVH as the best stock to own. Up nine percent year-to-date, it's ""growing the bottom line 15%, and taking market share both domestically and internationally."" Boruchow went on to say that owning the brand ""is kind of becoming sexy again.""
 Majority of Wall Street strategists see big stock market gains in the second half: CNBC survey
 ""Halftime Report"" trader Stephanie Link is hunting for under-valued plays, and on Wednesday she picked up shares of TJX. Countering Boruchow's pick of PVH, Links says that while she likes PVH, she believes that ""the risk reward at TJX is better than at PVH.""
While Boruchow suggests the tide might be turning for select retailers, he's quick to point out that this call isn't on the sector more broadly. There are ""too many high-level concerns around e-commerce penetration and Amazon,"" he said.

 Yellen: Prepared to take action on Wells Fargo's board if appropriate   
 9:46  AM ET Fri, 21 July 2017 |  05:52 
 Sen. Elizabeth Warren intensified her attacks on Wells Fargo, pressing Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday to remove all of the bank's directors who were on board during its fake accounts scandal.
 Yellen said the central bank is investigating the matter and will act should the facts warrant. The bank defended the steps it has taken to address its problems.
Warren previously had sent Yellen a letter asking for the board members' dismissal. The Massachusetts Democrat revealed that Yellen has since replied to that request, acknowledging that the Fed has the authority to act.
 ""How could removal of these board members not be warranted given the facts that we already know?"" Warren said during Yellen's semiannual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
Wells Fargo already has paid millions in fines and is nearing a settlement in a class-action lawsuit over the scandal, in which employees created some 2 million fake accounts for customers without their knowledge. They did so to meet aggressive sales goals that called for employees to use cross-selling techniques to enroll customers in as many programs as possible.
More than 5,000 employees have been fired in connection with the scandal, but Warren said that's not enough. She said the bank clearly has run afoul of Fed regulations calling for proper risk management, and people at the top should pay.
""Can you explain to me how the Wells board can possibly have satisfied its obligations under the Fed's risk management regulations?"" Warren said.
Yellen would not comment specifically on what actions the Fed will take, but she also was critical of the bank's actions.
""I will say that the behavior that we saw was egregious and unacceptable,"" she said. ""We do have the power if it proves appropriate to remove directors. A number of actions already have been taken. We need to conduct a thorough investigation to look at the full record to understand the root causes of the problems. We are certainly prepared to take enforcement actions if those prove to be appropriate.""
Warren, though, wasn't satisfied. She pointed out that the Fed already fined Wells Fargo in 2011 for illegally pushing mortgage borrowers into more expensive loans.
""Fines are not working with these giant financial institutions,"" the senator said. ""If bank directors who preside over the firing of thousands of employees for creation of millions of fake accounts can keep their jobs, then I think every bank director in this country knows that they are bulletproof and that poses a danger to the rest of us every single day.""
Wells Fargo representatives defended the actions the bank has taken to address the problems.
""Wells Fargo's board and management team have taken many actions in response to its retail sales practices issues, including changes in senior leadership, executive accountability actions and numerous steps to ensure we make things right with any customer affected by unacceptable sales practices. That work continues and remains a core part of our efforts to build a better Wells Fargo for the future,"" the bank said in a statement.

 Closing Bell Exchange: Watch ECB & for signals on Fed's balance sheet reduction   
 4:40  PM ET Thu, 13 July 2017 |  03:27 
 Wall Street learned on Thursday it doesn't know more than Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, said Wells Fargo chief equity strategist John Manley.
""She's aware of the inflation risks, she's aware of the deflation risk, she's aware of the asset bubble risk,"" Manley told CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" ""She's aware of all these things, and she's going to proceed cautiously.""
 The stock market was ready for another day of Yellen's testimony on Capitol Hill. On Wednesday, Yellen said the Fed would start to unravel its balance sheet later this year. She said the process would be gradual, and so would rate hikes.
""We started out with a bounce in the morning hoping that Yellen would bring another box of candy to the game,"" Art Cashin, managing director at UBS Financial Services, said on ""Closing Bell."" ""When she failed to do that, the market pulled back.""
Oil led a midday rally that was later bolstered by the Senate's debut of a new health-care bill, Cashin said. Wall Street was less concerned about the outcome of that particular bill and more concerned about what that meant for tax reform, he said.
""Finding a health-care bill that was not dead on arrival gave them the feeling not so much about health care but that maybe tax reform might have some life if these guys can get close to agreeing on health care,"" Cashin said.
Wall Street's optimism may be short-lived, however, as two key senators voiced their opposition to the bill Thursday.

 Wells Fargo beats but quality wasn't as good as expected: Vining Sparks's Marty Mosby   
 9:14  AM ET Fri, 14 July 2017 |  03:02 
 Wells Fargo, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, easily beat Wall Street expectations with second-quarter earnings of $1.07 per share but revenue was light and shares fell.
 The decline in the stock price wiped out Wells' gains for the year. The bank had been expected to show profit of $1.01 per share on revenue of $22.47 billion. Revenue came in at $22.17 billion. Shares dropped more than 1 percent in premarket trading following the release.
Total profit was $5.81 billion, or 4.5 percent from a year ago. 
 Big banks shares overall were taking a hit before the bell as traders were disappointed as well in earnings from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Trading was lower across the board; net gains from trading for Wells declined 28 percent for the quarter.
Bottom-line earnings got a boost from a 4-cent tax benefit on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services. 
Total average deposits were $1.3 trillion, up $64.5 billion, or 5 percent and total average loans stood at $956.9 billion, up $6.1 billion, or 1 percent. Mortgage banking income tumbled 18 percent to $1.15 billion.
The closely watched return on equity metric stood at 11.95 percent, ahead of the 10 percent cost of capital benchmark.
The report comes at a critical time for the bank, which has been battling reputation damage done following revelations last year that employees had been creating millions of accounts for customers without their knowledge.
""Second quarter 2017 results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we continued to generate strong financial results, invest for the future, and adhere to our prudent risk discipline,"" CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement. Just this week, Fed Chair Janet Yellen called the bank's behavior ""egregious"" and said regulators were continuing to look at the situation and would take action if necessary. Sen. Elizabeth Warren [D-Massachusetts] has been Congress' harshest critic of the bank, calling for removal of all 12 directors in place when the scandal unfolded.
""We continue to make process on rebuilding trust, which is our top priority,"" Sloan said on the earnings call with analysts. Wells Fargo recently joined its peers in having its capital plans approved following Fed stress tests. The bank upped its dividend a penny to 39 cents a share and intends to buy back $11.5 billion of shares. The stock is up less than 1 percent in 2017, vastly underperforming its peers. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is up 5.6 percent year to date.

 Banks turn lower despite earnings beats   
 7:38  PM ET Fri, 14 July 2017 |  03:01 
 As earnings seasons approached, investors flocked to financial stocks on anticipation that the high hopes for the sector would come true. So far, it's been an expensive losing bet.
 Bank shares slumped Friday in an early but important round of profit reports. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup — Nos. 1, 3 and 4 in terms of assets — each disappointed the market for various reasons. 
Financials broadly fell more than 1 percent by midday, and the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index specifically was off 1.2 percent. Wells Fargo dropped about 2 percent.
 That comes as investors have been pumping cash into an exchange-traded fund that tracks the industry, the Financial Select Sector SDPR. The ETF has hauled in just shy of $900 million in July — about a 3.6 percent gain in assets just for the period — as investors bet big on the banks.
Despite the decline Friday, no one is panicking yet. Indeed, ratings firm CFRA kept its buy recommendation on both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo and raised its price target $2 on each of the stocks.
""A lot of the environment around them is still pretty good just fundamentally,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. ""There's borrowing and lending going on again. With the stock market going to new highs, I think it's going to stoke a little new activity.""
Bank stocks immediately fell in premarket trading after the three big institutions released their earnings reports. They stayed negative through the trading day as investors digested the positions of the Wall Street leaders, and after weak inflation data sent government bond yields lower.
 Joseba Etxaburu | Reuters
 Indeed, Paulsen said the direction of yields will be a critical metric by which to gauge bank performance. 
Should the benchmark 10-year Treasury note break above 2.6 percent, the sector stands to benefit, he said. The road will be different under lower bond yields, in which case earnings will take more prominence.
""I think we break out [on yields]. If we do, they'll be OK,"" Paulsen said. ""Some of the sales have been weak, but that would be helped if you can raise the yield structure and steepen the curve again.""
That yield dynamic has created some uncertainty in the market lately. While Federal Reserve officials have indicated their desire to bring interest rates back to levels closer to historical norms, the inflation numbers have not been cooperating.
Consumer price index data Friday showed surprisingly weak pricing pressures, with June prices unchanged. The Fed is determined to bring inflation back up to 2 percent annualized, but the CPI now points to just a 1.6 percent reading.
However, Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at ACSI Funds, said the sector has other factors in its favor.
""The industry as a whole is in very good shape. Everyone passed the stress test for the first time in seven years,"" Quigg said, referencing the exams banks must pass to show that they can withstand another financial crisis. Each bank involved in the tests received approval for their plans to distribute capital to shareholders.
""There's also deregulation. There certainly will be a look into regulations. That's a real tail wind for the industry,"" added Quigg, whose fund has positions in Citi, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.
To be sure, not everyone is a fan.
Kevin O'Leary, who runs the O'Shares ETF family and is a judge on ABC""s ""Shark Tank,"" a program that also is syndicated on CNBC, believes the big bank stock run is at least taking a break for a while.
""This is the pause that refreshes going forward,"" O'Leary said on ""Fast Money Halftime Report."" He pointed to comments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon earlier in the day expressing frustration with the slow pace of fiscal reforms in Congress.
""In his words are caution,"" O'Leary said. ""I think if you're looking for what's going to make things work in financials, you don't have to own banks.""

 Wells Fargo CFO: There’s a lot to like about this past quarter   
 7:21  PM ET Fri, 14 July 2017 |  08:04 
 As the bank continues to rebuild its image, Wells Fargo CFO John Shrewsberry insisted Friday that the institution has taken aggressive steps and has held its leaders accountable for the fake accounts scandal.
 Shrewsberry's remarks came the same day the bank reported earnings that disappointed Wall Street — and a day after Sen. Elizabeth Warren ripped into Wells Fargo during a committee hearing, repeating her demand to Fed Chair Janet Yellen that the board members involved in the episode should be tossed from office.
In an interview on CNBC's ""Closing Bell,"" Shrewsberry did not address that demand specifically, but said Warren's comments neglected a lot of the work Wells Fargo has done.
 ""There's work on culture with employees, there's a lot of executive accountability that has been taken into account,"" he said. ""The board conducted a thorough investigation to get to the bottom of the root causes why things happened the way they did and what should be done about it, and there's still work under way.""
The bank in September 2016 agreed to pay a $185 million fine related to charges that employees created some two million accounts for customers without their knowledge. The workers did so to meet aggressive sales quotas the bank had to enroll customers in multiple programs.
Since then, former CEO John Stumpf has left the bank and a handful of other executives have departed as well. The bank recently announced another settlement, this time of $142 million to take care of a class-action lawsuit.
However, the bank's shares have underperformed and Warren and others continue to call for more accountability.
""There's a lot of work going on,"" Shrewsberry said. ""She didn't refer to any of that, which is fine. But we're talking about it with our customers, with our stakeholders including our investors and etc., and things are working.""
The bank earned $1.07 a share in the second quarter, ahead of analyst estimates of $1.01. However, the bottom line got a four-cent boost from a sale of Wells Fargo's insurance unit, and revenue missed expectations, sending shares down as much as 2 percent at one point Friday before ending the day off 1.1 percent.
Shrewsberry nevertheless saw the quarter as positive.
""Overall, actually it was really quite solid,"" he said. ""We're improving things. We're building a better bank.""

 Berenberg downgrades Wells Fargo shares   
 11:10  AM ET Fri, 21 July 2017 |  00:45 
 A difficult year for Wells Fargo shareholders will likely get much worse, according to Berenberg. The firm lowered its rating for the bank's shares to sell from hold, saying the bank will report earnings below consensus expectations next year. In a note to investors on Thursday, the firm said Wells Fargo has lost the magic it once had generating higher returns than peers, and so will revert to long-term industry averages.""We believe that Wells Fargo (WFC) has become too big to differentiate itself from wider market trends and deliver the growth which management promises and the market expects,"" analyst James Chappell wrote in the note. ""We have cut our EPS forecasts to reflect a weaker outlook for revenues driven by a number of factors including weak demand for credit, rates lower for longer and a weaker non-interest income outlook.""
 Wells Fargo stock price was down less than 1 percent in Friday's premarket.
Chappell reduced his 12-month price target to $35 from $45 for Wells Fargo shares, which would be a 36 percent decline from Thursday's close. His new price forecast is the lowest on Wall Street, according to FactSet. Wells Fargo has underperformed the market this year. Its shares are down 0.5 percent year to date compared with the S&P 500's 10.5 percent gain through Thursday. Wells Fargo has the biggest share of the U.S. commercial real estate lending and auto loans businesses. ""Once banks became so large, few economies of scale or scope exist and organizational control becomes much more difficult,"" Chappell wrote.
 He predicts Wells Fargo will generate 2018 earnings per share of $3.81 versus the Wall Street consensus of $4.46.  Only 19 percent of Wall Street analysts have sell or underweight ratings on Wells Fargo, according to FactSet.  Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A customer leaves an ATM at a Wells Fargo branch in Denver.
 Wells Fargo said on Thursday that it would compensate around 570,000 customers with car loans who were harmed by being forced to buy auto insurance. 
 The bank estimated the total cost at around $80 million. 
Auto-loan contracts require customers to have comprehensive insurance for potential damage, and the bank was permitted under the contracts to buy that coverage and pass on the cost if there was no evidence it had been purchased elsewhere, Wells Fargo noted in the statement on Thursday.
 But it added that its ""internal controls were inadequate,"" with customers charged insurance premiums even if they were paying for their own vehicle insurance. 
""We take full responsibility for our failure to appropriately manage the collateral protection insurance program and are extremely sorry for any harm this caused our customers, who expect and deserve better from us,"" Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo Consumer Lending, said in the statement.
""Upon our discovery, we acted swiftly to discontinue the program and immediately develop a plan to make impacted customers whole,"" he said. 
The overcharging of customers for auto insurance was first reported by the New York Times on Thursday. 
That article, citing a 60-page internal report prepared by consulting firm Oliver Wyman, said that Wells Fargo required a much larger number of customers — more than 800,000 — who took out car loans to buy auto insurance they did not need.
The cost of the unnecessary insurance pushed around 274,000 customers into delinquency and resulted in nearly 25,000 wrongful vehicle repossessions, the article said, citing the internal report.
The internal report examined insurance policies sold to Wells Fargo customers from the beginning of 2012 through mid-2016, the article said, noting the practice began as early as 2006 and continued through September of 2016.
Wells Fargo's mea culpa over the improper auto insurance sales marked another black eye for the bank.
In September, Wells Fargo reached a $185 million settlement with regulators over creating what the bank then said could be as many as 2.1 million accounts in customer names without their permission.
Workers created the accounts to meet the bank's aggressive sales quotas to enroll customers in multiple programs.
Since then, former CEO John Stumpf has left the bank and a handful of other executives have departed as well. Wells Fargo recently announced another settlement — this time $142 million to take care of a class-action lawsuit.
 The Wells Fargo board recently decided to claw back more money from Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of the community bank unit head, where the scandal unfolded.

 Wall Street is livid over Wells Fargo's latest scandal   
 6:28  PM ET Mon, 31 July 2017 |  01:05 
 Analysts are angry over the latest Wells Fargo scandal where hundreds of thousands of the bank's customers were overcharged.  Wells Fargo shares fell 2.6 percent Friday after The New York Times first reported the news. The stock closed 1.2 percent higher Monday, meanwhile. The article cited a 60-page internal report, which revealed more than 800,000 of Wells Fargo's auto loan customers were charged for car insurance they did not need. Wells Fargo estimated the mistaken auto insurance sales would cost the bank $80 million in damages. Piper Jaffray said the true cost is likely understated. ""We believe the full cost may be significantly higher and weigh on the risk premium the market will place on shares,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Kevin Barker wrote in a note to clients Friday entitled ""Here we go again?""

 Barker noted how the problem was identified in July of last year, but was not disclosed to investors and the public until last week. ""Why didn't the company address these issues publicly while they were already dealing with the account scandal rather than address them now?"" he wrote. ""What other collateral damage may have been caused by the re-possession of these cars on peoples' lives?"" Barker reiterated his neutral rating for Wells Fargo and his $52 price target for the shares, representing 2 percent downside to Friday's close. In similar fashion, JPMorgan also focused in on the bank's lack of disclosure and its culture. ""It is very surprising that Wells Fargo has not changed the opaqueness in its disclosure and only disclosed this late on Thursday night when it realized a news story was about to break,"" JPMorgan analyst Vivek Juneja wrote Monday. ""This raises the question about what other changes Wells Fargo needs in its culture. There has been no change to the Board despite all the scandals, which has been frustrating some shareholders."" Juneja reaffirmed his $57 price target for Wells Fargo shares and his neutral rating. Sen. Elizabeth Warren pressed Fed Chair Janet Yellen on July 13 to remove all of the Wells Fargo's directors who were on board during its fake accounts scandal revealed last year. In September, Wells Fargo reached a $185 million settlement with regulators over creating what the bank then said could be as many as 2.1 million accounts in customer names without their permission.  On latest auto insurance scandal, the bank apologized and said it moved quickly to end the program Thursday. ""We take full responsibility for our failure to appropriately manage the collateral protection insurance program and are extremely sorry for any harm this caused our customers, who expect and deserve better from us,"" Franklin Codel, head of Wells Fargo Consumer Lending, said in the statement. ""Upon our discovery, we acted swiftly to discontinue the program and immediately develop a plan to make impacted customers whole.""Wells Fargo shares have under-performed the market this year. Its stock declined 3.3 percent year to date through Friday versus the S&P 500's 10.4 percent return. The shares rose 1 percent Monday.
A proposed class action lawsuit was filed Sunday, which accuses the bank of racketeering violations and fraud over the auto insurance scandal.
 Catherine Pulley, a spokesperson for Wells Fargo, sent the following statement for this story:
 ""Wells Fargo discontinued its Collateral Protection Insurance (CPI) program in September 2016 after finding inadequacies in vendor processes and our internal controls that negatively impacted some customers. We announced a plan to remediate auto loan customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to auto CPI policies placed between 2012-2017. We are very sorry for the inconvenience this caused impacted customers and we are in the process of notifying them and making things right.""

 Wells Fargo shares fall after filing warns may find 'significant increase' in unauthorized accounts   
 5:51  PM ET Fri,  4 Aug 2017 |  00:46 
 Wells Fargo shares fell Friday after a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed a new review of the bank's consumer sales scandal could reveal a ""significant increase"" in unauthorized accounts. 
 ""We expect that our review of the expanded time periods ... may lead to a significant increase in the identified number of potentially unauthorized accounts,"" the firm said in the filing. ""However, we do not expect any incremental customer remediation costs as a result of these efforts to have a significant financial impact on the Company."" 
Wells Fargo said in the filing it expects legal costs could exceed what it has already set aside by $3.3 billion.
 Shares closed 1 percent lower Friday.
Wells Fargo one-day performance
 Source: FactSet
The bank, once considered the most upstanding of America's financial giants, has been plagued by scandal in the last year.
Last fall, the bank paid $185 million in penalties after it was discovered workers had opened about 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization since 2011. The workers were trying to meet aggressive sales goals, a practice the bank has since abandoned after clearing out top managers deemed responsible for the problems.
Then in late July, news broke that hundreds of thousands of Wells Fargo customers were charged for auto insurance they did not need. The bank said on July 27 it plans to give about 570,000 customers a total $80 million for damages starting in August 2017.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has also begun an investigation into whether customers were affected by Wells Fargo's freezing and, in many cases, closing, of consumer deposit accounts, the filing said.
""To regain the trust we have lost, we must continue to be transparent with all our stakeholders and go beyond what has been asked of us by our regulators by reviewing all of our operations —leaving no stone unturned — so we can be confident we have done all that we can do to build a better, stronger Wells Fargo,"" CEO Tim Sloan, who took the position in the wake of the sales scandal, said in a separate press release Friday.
 Lucas Jackson | Reuters
Tim Sloan, Chief Executive Officer of Wells Fargo & Company
 The bank is starting to rebound. Last month, Wells Fargo reported second-quarter earnings above expectations and said net interest income rose 6 percent to a record $12.8 billion. 
Gerard Cassidy, banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" that the bank's description of legal costs was typical of the language banks use and he didn't think Wells would need to raise additional capital in order to meet its costs.
""Wells, just like everyone in the banking system today, are so overcapitalized that thought wouldn't even enter our heads,"" he said.
Wells Fargo said it has expanded the review to ""cover the entire consent order period of January 2011 through September 2016, and to perform a voluntary review of accounts from 2009 to 2010.""
The bank is working with an ""independent consultant to determine the 'root cause' of the sales practices issues"" and expects to complete the review by the end of the third quarter of this year.
Wells' Board of Directors is also reviewing the structure, composition and practices of the bank, which is ""expected to result in actions in third quarter 2017,"" the filing said. 
""I think what we're going to hear in the third quarter is how the company is going to put more procedures and controls in place to prevent this from happening in the future,"" Cassidy said.
The filing was a quarterly 10-Q filing required by the SEC for public firms.
Sloan added in the release that Wells Fargo finalized Friday a settlement agreement of $108 million with the U.S. government over a longstanding lawsuit over some Veterans Administration mortgage refinance loans. ""We deny the allegations,"" Sloan said.
Separately, Wells also said in the filing it is cooperating with the Department of Justice and voluntarily disclosed to the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control an issue in which ""certain foreign banks utilized a Wells Fargo software-based solution to conduct import/export trade-related financing transactions with countries and entities"" the agency prohibits. Wells said it did not believe any transaction-related funds flowed through the bank as a result of the foreign banks' actions.

18,2017-08-07,"Wells Fargo, awash in scandal, faces violations over car insurance refunds  Wells Fargo vows to disclose all legal matters amid scandals, analyst says  Wells Fargo vows to disclose all legal matters amid scandals, analyst says  ","Wells Fargo, the scandal-plagued bank, is facing new regulatory scrutiny for not refunding insurance money owed to people who paid off their car loans early, according to people briefed on the inquiry.
Just last month Wells Fargo was found to have forced unneeded collision insurance on consumers who financed their car purchases. That practice, first disclosed by The New York Times, affected 800,000 customers according to an analysis commissioned by the bank. Some 274,000 people were pushed into delinquency as a result, and 25,000 cars were wrongly repossessed.
The latest inquiry, by officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, where the bank has its headquarters, involves a different, specialized type of insurance that is sold to consumers when they buy a car. Called guaranteed auto protection insurance, or GAP, it is intended to protect a lender against the fact that a car — the collateral for its loan — loses significant value the moment it is driven off the lot.
 Charles Mostoller | Reuters
A woman passes a Wells Fargo sign.
 GAP insurance, also known as guaranteed asset protection, makes up that difference for a lender if, for instance, a car is stolen before the loan is paid off. Regular car insurance typically covers only the current market value.
Because Wells Fargo is a large auto lender, tens of thousands of customers may have been affected by the bank's actions on GAP insurance.
It is not mandatory for car buyers to carry GAP insurance, which typically costs $400 to $600. But car dealers push the insurance, and lenders like it because of the protection it provides. When borrowers pay off the loans early, they are entitled to a refund of some of the GAP insurance premium because the coverage they paid for is no longer needed.
Laws in nine states require that customers get unused insurance money back. They are Alabama, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Oregon and South Carolina.
Jennifer A. Temple, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, provided a statement saying: ""During an internal review, we discovered issues related to a lack of oversight and controls surrounding the administration of Guaranteed Asset Protection products. We are reviewing our practices and actively working with our dealers and have already begun making improvements to the GAP refund process. If we find customer impacts, we will make customers whole.""
Ms. Temple declined to say when the problem began. She said the bank was trying to assess how many customers had been affected. Wells Fargo improved controls on the refund process in 2014, she said. The unit of the bank that makes car loans is called Wells Fargo Dealer Services.
Asked about the regulatory inquiry into GAP insurance at Wells Fargo, Darren Gersh, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve Board in Washington said, ""We are focused on ensuring that the root causes of a firm's compliance and controls breakdowns are understood and addressed."" He declined to comment on the specifics, adding that ""the Federal Reserve Board will take any regulatory and supervisory steps we feel are necessary to ensure the firm's attention to compliance.""

A failure to refund the insurance money harmed borrowers whose cars were repossessed by increasing what they owed, a figure that the bank reports to consumer credit bureaus. All 50 states require that the amount of unused insurance be credited to those borrowers' accounts, reducing the amount owed.
The bank alluded to the new problem briefly in its quarterly financial statement issued Friday. ""The company has identified certain issues related to the unused portion of guaranteed auto protection waiver or insurance agreements between the dealer and, by assignment, the lender, which may result in refunds to customers in certain states,"" Wells Fargo said in the filing.
""These and other issues related to the origination, servicing and/or collection of indirect consumer auto loans, including related insurance products, may subject the company to formal or informal inquiries, investigations or examinations from federal, state and/or local government agencies, and may also subject the company to litigation.""
GAP coverage is similar to home mortgage insurance, which shields lenders against a default if a borrower loses his or her job and cannot make the payments.
Car buyers who finance their purchases typically add the cost of the GAP coverage to the amount of the loan. The interest that borrowers pay on the coverage goes to the bank that made the loan.
""Dealer Services is on a journey to strengthen its business, fix problems and help build a better Wells Fargo,"" Ms. Temple said. ""We've taken huge proactive steps to improve the customer experience.""
The new problem raises questions about Wells Fargo's internal controls and its board's oversight of company operations.
In a separate crisis at Wells Fargo that was exposed last year, bank employees were found to have created millions of credit card and bank accounts that customers had not requested. That led to millions of dollars in fines and the departure of the chief executive, John G. Stumpf.

 More recently, after the disclosure that the bank had forced auto insurance on customers who did not need it, several Democratic lawmakers asked that hearings be convened to learn more.
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who is on the Senate Banking Committee, also reiterated her request that the Fed oust 12 of Wells Fargo's 15 directors, saying they had violated their duties to oversee risk management at the bank in the period when the improprieties had taken place.
In its regulatory filing on Friday, Wells said its directors had undertaken actions to enhance governance and oversight.
""The board recognizes that there is still work to be done, and, in response to feedback received at our annual stockholders meeting in April 2017, the board is engaging in an ongoing comprehensive review of its structure, composition and practices,"" it said. The bank expects the review to result in changes to be disclosed in the coming months, it added.
In a statement to employees issued Friday with the filing, Timothy J.

 Wells Fargo vows to disclose all legal matters amid scandals, analyst says   
 2:03  PM ET Mon,  7 Aug 2017 |  00:44 
 Wells Fargo is feeling the heat and will disclose all outstanding legal matters, not just updates, in its quarterly regulatory filings, according to Evercore ISI.
 The bank's stock fell 1 percent Friday after the company revealed in an SEC filing it may find a ""significant increase"" in unauthorized accounts after a new review of its consumer sales scandal.
Wells Fargo shares have underperformed the market this year after multiple controversies involving the unauthorized opening of accounts in customers' names and improper charges for auto insurance customers didn't seek. Its stock had declined 4.1 percent year to date through Friday versus the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return.
 ""Wells Fargo flagged several items in its 10Q filed on Friday, which together, weighed on the stock in late afternoon trading. … On our follow-up call, mgmt noted that as Wells Fargo tries to improve its transparency, it has adopted a policy whereby it will disclose all outstanding legal matters (and not just updates) in its 10Q filings, going fwd,"" Evercore ISI analyst John Pancari wrote in a note to clients Sunday. ""Visibility into the regulatory and legal issues at Wells remains limited, and earnings momentum appears to be suffering somewhat.""
Pancari reiterated his outperform rating and 12-month price target of $62 for Wells Fargo shares, which is 17 percent higher than Friday's closing price.
He said Wells Fargo admitted its legal costs could be more than the current high-end $3.3 billion estimate.
""On our follow-up call, mgmt confirmed there has been no change to RPL [reasonably possible potential losses] since the 2Q earnings call and the filing of the 10Q. Notably, Wells Fargo acknowledged that due to the uncertain nature of legal outcomes, actual losses may be in excess of the RPL,"" Pancari wrote.
An analyst told CNBC on Friday he didn't expect Wells Fargo would need to raise additional capital in order to meet its legal costs.
""Wells, just like everyone in the banking system today, are so overcapitalized that thought wouldn't even enter our heads,"" Gerard Cassidy, banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said on ""Closing Bell.""
Last September, Wells Fargo reached a $185 million settlement with regulators for creating what the bank then said could be as many as 2.1 million accounts in customer names without their permission. Sen. Elizabeth Warren pressed Fed Chair Janet Yellen on July 13 to remove all of the Wells Fargo's directors who were on the board when the fake accounts scandal came to light.
Wells Fargo sent the following statement in response to this story:
 ""The disclosures included in our filing [Friday] reflect the company's continued commitment to transparency. Our top priority is to rebuild trust, and this work includes an ongoing effort to identify and address other areas or instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. We remain focused on making things right for our customers, team members, community partners and shareholders and on building a better Wells Fargo.""

 Dollar could be about to hit an inflection point, Wells Fargo says   
 9:43  AM ET Tue,  8 Aug 2017 |  00:33 
 The U.S. dollar index has fallen by around 9 percent since the start of the year but that could be about to change, according to strategists at Wells Fargo, who suggest the stocks and sectors which could be positively affected amid the move higher.
 Disappointing economic data, political uncertainty and positive developments abroad have sent the U.S. dollar lower despite two rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. ""We review the recent selling as overdone and expect a stronger U.S. dollar from current levels by year-end 2017, a reversal of the current trend,"" Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo, said in a note on Monday.
The update in the forecast was due to three reasons: differences among global interest rates, economic growth and inflation; further political risks in the euro area; and investors becoming too negative on the greenback.
 While in the U.S. the Fed is raising rates and shrinking its balance sheet, in Europe, the central bank is unlikely to deviate from negative rates soon. At the same time growth and inflation in the U.S. have recovered at a faster pace than in Europe. ""While that lead has narrowed as growth and inflation in the euro area have rebounded, it still favors the U.S.,"" the bank said.
 ""Put another way... it seems that expectations for the U.S. government to get anything done are too low and for the euro are too high.""
-Sameer Samana, Global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo
 Furthermore, Wells Fargo recognizes the lower political uncertainty in Europe following the French presidential vote – which could push the euro higher - and a U.S. administration that hasn't delivered on some of its campaign pledges.
However, it sees the upcoming Italian elections as a large political and economic risk to the euro area. ""Put another way, at current levels on the currency pair, it seems that expectations for the U.S. government to get anything done are too low and for the euro are too high,"" Samana said. The euro was trading at 1.188 against the dollar early on Tuesday morning.
Lastly, analysts at Wells Fargo said that investors have become the most negative on the U.S. dollar since 2014, ""which sets the stage for positive surprises in the U.S. dollar's favor in the second half (of the year).""

 ""The most important implications for investors at this point would be to reduce positions in commodities and developed-market debt towards our current tactical underweight stance,"" Wells Fargo suggested.
Wells Fargo believes that earnings growth in the second half of 2017 will be lower than in the first six months but suggests that four sectors are set to outperform the wider market: consumer discretionary, financials, health care and information technology.
""We recommend investors use any pullbacks as opportunities to average into shares of quality cyclical companies,"" the note said.

Stephen Sanger, Wells Fargo Chairman
 Wells Fargo's Stephen Sanger will likely step down as nonexecutive chairman as part of the board's effort to restructure the bank in the wake of its consumer sales scandal, Dow Jones reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. 
 Wells Fargo declined to comment to CNBC. 
Directors are planning to make final decisions on any changes by Labor Day, the news wire said, citing some of the sources.
 Last Friday, Wells Fargo said in a quarterly SEC filing that its Board of Directors is reviewing the structure, composition, and practices of the bank, which is ""expected to result in actions in third quarter 2017.""
Sanger is expected to step down by the bank's shareholder meeting next spring, the report said, citing one source. 
Vice Chair Elizabeth Duke, who was a member of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors during the financial crisis, is then likely to take the spot, the report said, citing some of the people.
Sanger was elected chairman of the board in Oct. 2016 and was chairman of General Mills for more than a decade until he retired in May 2008, according to Wells Fargo's website. Sanger is also a director of Pfizer, the site said. 
Wells Fargo shares traded about 0.9 percent lower, near session lows, after the report. The stock is down 5 percent this year.
Wells Fargo, once considered the most upstanding of America's financial giants, has been plagued by scandal in the last year. 
Last fall, the bank paid $185 million in penalties after it was discovered that since 2011, workers trying to meet aggressive sales goals had opened about 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization. The bank has since abandoned those sales goals after clearing out top managers deemed responsible for the problems.
Then in late July, news broke that hundreds of thousands of Wells Fargo customers were charged for auto insurance they did not need. The bank said on July 27 it plans to give about 570,000 customers a total $80 million for damages starting in August 2017.

A man uses a Wells Fargo automated teller machine inside a bank branch in New York.
 There is an adage that ""it's better to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."" In the world of corporate misconduct, it seems that there is even less need to beg forgiveness these days as the government scales back how much it will police companies that appear to have violated the law.
There may be no better recent example of how a corporate culture devolved into an almost preternatural focus on expanding the bottom line at the expense of customers and the law than Wells Fargo. [Full disclosure: My home mortgage is with the bank.]
In April,  a report of an internal investigation into how the bank opened more than two million bogus customer accounts blamed leadership in its community banking division, saying that it ""resisted and impeded outside scrutiny and oversight"" while the former chief executive ""failed to appreciate the seriousness of the problem."" Wells Fargo  recently disclosed that further investigation ""may lead to a significant increase"" in the number of unauthorized accounts, meaning that the problem may go far deeper than first thought.
 More from New York Times:Netflix signs Shonda Rhimes in counterpunch to ABC and Disney  Cracking the airlines' dress code  Bitcoin price surges after agreement on software update
If Wells Fargo hoped that the bogus accounts issue was its only problem, it was sadly mistaken.
The investigation also unearthed problems at its Merchant Services subsidiary that processed credit card transactions in which smaller companies may have been overcharged.  A report on CNN about a recent lawsuit accusing the bank of breaching its agreements quoted an anonymous former employee of the bank who said, ""We used to be told to go out and club the baby seals: mom-pop-shops that had no legal support"" — a ""customer-be-damned"" attitude to increase revenue.
The New York Times  reported that Wells Fargo is facing new questions about failing to refund insurance payments to borrowers who repaid their car loans early, and that it forced some to take unneeded collision insurance that pushed more than 250,000 borrowers into delinquency, including 25,000 whose cars were repossessed improperly. A statement from a bank spokeswoman said, ""If we find customer impacts, we will make customers whole"" — a way of asking forgiveness rather than permission.
In its most recent quarterly report, Wells Fargo disclosed that it increased its estimate of the costs from legal claims to about $3.3 billion. Yet, for all the issues the bank has faced, the only regulatory action against it has been  a $185 million settlement with the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, its lead regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Los Angeles City Attorney.
A review of  the Corporate Prosecution Registry maintained by the University of Virginia Law Library does not show Wells Fargo being the defendant in a criminal prosecution. It did settle  a civil suit filed by the Justice Department in 2016 by paying $1.2 billion and admitted improperly certifying mortgages to obtain insurance from the Federal Housing Administration.
The bank has not been the subject of an enforcement action by the  Securities and Exchange Commission over its disclosure or accounting practices, although last year its investment bank was sued, accused of fraudrelated to a bond underwriting in Rhode Island.
Will Wells Fargo be held to account for the many ways in which it mistreated its customers? The prospect of governmental action appears to be diminishing, and any fines it might face are likely to be at the low end of the scale based on recent enforcement trends since the start of the administration of President Trump.
Penalties imposed by financial regulators so far in 2017 are much lower than for the comparable period last year,  according to The Wall Street Journal. That may be a reflection of the end of the financial crisis cases, but the new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Jay Clayton,  stated during his confirmation hearing that ""shareholders do bear those costs and we have to keep that in mind.""
A  report issued by the Environmental Integrity Project last week shows that federal environmental enforcement has also dropped, with fewer lawsuits against companies and a 60 percent drop in civil penalties during the first six months of the new administration.
Even private litigation by consumers against corporations would be substantially reduced under a bill passed by the House in March. One part in the legislation would require each member of a class action to show the same injuries as all others before a federal court can certify it to proceed, severely limiting the number of such cases when the harm may not be the same to all.
The flow of information about potential problems in banks will be curtailed under  new regulatory guidance from the Federal Reserve, which oversees the largest banks. To ease the burden on the board of directors, the Fed would no longer require that the findings of a supervisory examination of the bank be given to the directors, and instead management would be responsible for passing along information about those matters that affect corporate governance.
Of course, the proposal is offered as a major benefit to corporate boards, with the Fed asserting that it will ""improve corporate governance overall, increase efficiency, support greater accountability, and promote compliance with laws and regulations."" Directors would still be ""responsible for holding senior management accountable for remediating supervisory findings,"" although they might not be aware of them.
One of the basic requirements of corporate governance is the ""Caremark duty"" imposed on directors, named for  an opinion from the Delaware Chancery Court in 1996. A board must put in place reporting systems to ensure that sufficient information reaches the directors to enable them to oversee the company and, when necessary, deal with problems. That duty does not permit delegating oversight responsibility to management, and directors should not just sit back and wait for information to pop to the surface.
A problem in holding individuals accountable for misconduct in an organization is the disconnect between the actual decisions and those charged with overseeing the company, so that executives and corporate boards usually plead ignorance about an issue until it is too late. As Gretchen Morgenson pointed out in her  Fair Game column about the Fed's proposal, ""reducing the information flow between bank boards and their examiners just doesn't seem smart.""
Government regulation and enforcement can be a ham-fisted way of ensuring corporate compliance, so decreased regulation and lower penalties do not necessarily mean there will be an uptick in the number of violations. But if the regulatory environment sends the message that there will be few consequences for misconduct, then there may be little need to even seek forgiveness when there is a reduced prospect of being caught and punished.

 Elizabeth Duke named chair of Wells Fargo board   
 7:38  PM ET Tue, 15 Aug 2017 |  00:45 
 Wells Fargo announced a board shakeup Tuesday, including the coming retirement of three directors, in a restructuring effort following the bank's consumer sales scandal.
 Elizabeth, or ""Betsy,"" Duke will take Stephen Sanger's position as independent chair effective Jan. 1, 2018, according to the bank's announcement. 
Cynthia H. Milligan and Susan G. Swenson, who both joined the board in the 1990s, will retire at the end of the year ""to help facilitate Board refreshment and provide for an appropriate transition of committee membership,"" the release said. 
 ""The changes announced today reflect a thoughtful and deliberate process by the Board that was informed by the company's engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders, as well as the Board's annual self-evaluation that was conducted after the 2017 Annual Meeting and prior to its typical year-end timing,"" Sanger said in a statement.
The bank also said Juan Pujadas, a retired principal of PricewaterhouseCoopers, will join the board as a new independent director.
As a result of the changes, the board will have 13 members. The board plans to add one to three more directors over the long term. 
The bank also announced Enrique Hernandez, Jr. will take over as chair of the risk committee, whose oversight was expanded to include Wells Fargo's new Conduct Management Office. 
The board also announced changes to the leadership of its governance and nominating committee, corporate responsibility committee, and audit and examination committee. 
Duke became a director in 2015, according to the bank's proxy statement earlier this year. She is a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. 
""Betsy's regulatory expertise has been invaluable to Wells Fargo, and I know that the combination of her banking and risk management experience will continue to serve the Board and the company well in her new role as Chair,"" Timothy Sloan, CEO and president, said in the statement. 
Sloan took over the company in October 2016 after the bank paid $185 million in penalties following the revelation that since 2011, workers trying to meet aggressive sales goals had opened about 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization. The bank has since abandoned those sales goals after clearing out top managers deemed responsible for the problems.
Similar issues have arisen in the last few months for the bank, which was once considered the most admired of America's financial giants. 
In late July, news broke that hundreds of thousands of Wells Fargo customers were charged for auto insurance they did not need. The bank said on July 27 it plans to give about 570,000 customers a total $80 million for damages starting in August 2017.

 Trump throughout his career & campaign, has been narcissistic, uncouth, offensive: Kovacevich   
 2:38  PM ET Wed, 16 Aug 2017 |  04:35 
 The CEOs who joined President Donald Trump's councils shouldn't be surprised by his behavior, former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich told CNBC on Wednesday.
 Members of the president's Strategic and Policy Forum agreed to disband the group on Wednesday after Trump's controversial remarks about the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend. Shortly after CNBC and others broke the news, Trump announced on Twitter he was ending that forum and his manufacturing council.
""Is there anything here that's happened that was totally unexpected? Donald Trump throughout his business career, throughout the entire campaign, has been narcissistic, he's been uncouth, he's been offensive,"" Kovacevich said in an interview with ""Power Lunch.""
 ""It shouldn't be surprising that it's come to something like this.""
Business leaders and Republicans have been distancing themselves from Trump since his response to the rally. One person was killed and 19 others were injured when a suspected white nationalist rammed a car into counterprotesters.
On Saturday, Trump said both sides were to blame and on Tuesday he defended that response. He also said ""not all"" the people attending the rally were bad.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Wells Fargo Investment Institute raised its year-end S&P 500 price target citing strong overseas growth and strong second-quarter earnings. The new forecast still calls for lower prices from here.
 ""Earlier this year, we had concerns that investors might fret over potential for a 2018 pickup in inflation and interest rates,"" wrote Paul Christopher, Wells Fargo's head global market strategist. ""But our new (and more moderate) inflation expectations imply less S&P 500 index downside than we previously had anticipated.""
Christopher raised the target to a range of 2,300 to 2,400, up from its prior range of 2,230 to 2,330. The high end of the new forecast is about 1 percent below where the S&P 500 closed on Monday. Wells Fargo Investment Institute now sees S&P 500 EPS at $129, implying a 17.83 to 18.60 price-to-earnings ratio.
 ""We expect faster economic growth and low inflation in the second half to support continuing S&P 500 Index earnings growth,"" added the strategist, referring to the strong earnings numbers in the second quarter. However, ""small-cap valuations remain stretched versus historical levels … We recommend investors remain evenweight mid caps and underweight small caps.""
The strategist called bond-bubble fears overblown, adding that the 10-year Treasury yield could move modestly higher as the U.S. economy continues to expand and labor markets tighten.
""U.S. demographic trends are unlikely to change without a meaningful increase in new immigration — and debt levels are likely to deteriorate over the next decade,"" wrote Christopher. ""So unless productivity-growth trends reverse, the 'Greenspan bond-bubble' fears are misplaced.""
The revised range puts Wells Fargo Investment Institute just below the average forecast of Wall Street strategists. The median year-end target among top Wall Street firms is about 2,430, with Morgan Stanley's 2,700 forecast the highest and Fundstrat's 2,275 forecast the lowest.

Tim Sloan, Chief Executive Officer of Wells Fargo & Company, February 8, 2017.
 Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan said Tuesday that forthcoming results from the bank's review of its consumer sales scandal could cause more negative attention. 
 ""The results of our reviews will generate news headlines, but even as we face this renewed coverage, the best thing we can do is stay focused on fixing problems, making things right for customers, and building a better, stronger Wells Fargo,"" Sloan said in a company-wide message that was shared in a press release. 
Sloan also said that ""within a few weeks"" the bank will announce the completion of an expanded review by a third party of the fake consumer accounts workers had opened. They were pressured by aggressive sales goals, a practice Wells Fargo has since ended. 
 In an Aug. 4 quarterly 10-Q filing required by the SEC for public firms, Wells Fargo said it expanded the review period to 2009 through 2016 and that could reveal a ""significant increase"" in unauthorized accounts.
""This analysis examined account usage patterns and is constructed to err on the side of the customer in determining which accounts are included as potentially unauthorized,"" Sloan said Tuesday.
The bank will also send notices about the process for customers to make claims against the bank and is compiling a list of additional customers who complained an account was opened without their consent, Sloan said in the memo. 
The bank has now paid more than $5 million in total customer refunds or payments, the release said. 
Sloan took over Wells Fargo last fall after it was discovered the bank's workers had opened about 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization since 2011. Wells Fargo paid $185 million in penalties.
This year, the bank also reached a preliminary class-action settlement of $142 million over concerns about retail sales practices and unauthorized accounts from 2002. 
Wells Fargo shares were little changed in after-hours trade but are down 5 percent so far in 2017, trailing the Financial Select Sector SPDR, which is up nearly 7 percent year to date.
In a statement to CNBC, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Mary Eshet referred to the Aug. 4 10-Q filing.
""The team news [press release] shared the things we have done and are doing to make things right for customers,"" she said, ""and reminded team members that if the results of the review result in news stories, the best thing for team members to do is stay focused on customers.""

 Here's what millennials are saving for that's not retirement   
 1:01  PM ET Tue, 23 May 2017 |  00:54 
 Wells Fargo Investment Institute has advice for millennials as they start to take a leading role in shaping the U.S. economy: start saving.
 According to the institute's generational research report, a sizable 41 percent of Americans aged 17 to 35 haven't started saving for retirement, a fact many younger workers are attributing to a lack of disposable income.
The median household income for millennials in the United States is $48,039. While some younger millennials have yet to commit to full-time work, that number is still about 20 percent less than Baby Boomers earned at the same stage in life, according to the report.
 The lack of savings has consequences down the road, as many people may be forced to delay retirement, the Wells Fargo researchers said. ""Half of today's workers expect they will need to work until at least the age of 70 because they will not have enough saved for their retirement years."" Their report is called Seeing Wealth Differently Across Generations.
As the largest demographic group in the U.S. labor force (having just surpassed the older baby boomers), millennials are just starting to form households and start families. The report cites Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that wages are beginning to increase.
They are driving consumer discretionary spending: Millennials spend $2,915 per year on average for travel, for example, according to TripAdvisor, and that is expected to increase as the generation enters its higher-earning years, the report said. 
But almost 34 percent have student debt, with a median balance of nearly $20,000. And of those who have debt, 75 percent said it is unmanageable, Wells Fargo said.
Those aren't the only changes millennials are bringing to the markets. Wells Fargo's research suggests that the rise of social media and ease of global communication makes younger generations more likely to invest overseas, especially to pursue social goals.
""Social and environmental change is important to millennials,"" wrote the researchers. ""This tendency lends itself perfectly to social impact investing, which offers investors the potential to achieve financial goals while also influencing causes they're passionate about.""
Baby boomers, those aged 53 to 71, may also have to make some changes to their portfolios. While about 73 percent of baby boomers are investing for retirement, many are now starting to fear that they may have to work a few years more to have enough capital to retire comfortably; each dollar may not go far enough. That may keep boomers more involved in the stock market longer than in generations past.
While it has been the tendency for savers to shift from stocks to bonds as retirement approaches, ""due to today's low interest rates and longer working lives, Baby Boomers may need to maintain a higher allocation to equities,"" the report said.
Though boomers control over half of the wealth in the United States, the cohort is about to face a significant uptick in health care spending in both absolute terms and as a percentage of income.

 Wells Fargo unveils results of expanded account review   
 9:41  AM ET Thu, 31 Aug 2017 |  01:26 
 The headlines keep getting worse for Wells Fargo in its fake account scandal, but the latest disclosures actually could represent a turning point.
 Revelations on Thursday that some 3.5 million accounts were affected should constitute a full disclosure of the problem and allow the beleaguered bank to begin putting the scandal behind it, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note.
""The fact that the company has completed its comprehensive third-party account review and has communicated the finality of its customer remediation plans is a positive in our view,"" KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a note. ""The retail sales practice scandal settlement was announced nearly a year ago, and at this stage we now expect the trickle of new information to slow considerably.""
 Wells Fargo shares took a hit from the announcement, falling 0.8 percent by mid-Thursday afternoon. It's been a terrible year for the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, marked by a big reputational hit that has sent shares down about 7.6 percent year to date. By comparison, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is off about 1.2 percent in what has been a rough year for financials overall.
However, Kleinhanzl thinks Wells Fargo can begin to repair some of the damage. He noted that the bank already had gone public that there would be a further review that would show more accounts affected.

Pedestrians pass in front of a Wells Fargo bank branch in New York.
 ""As the company puts the retail sales practice scandal in the rearview mirror, then we would expect to see the year-to-date underperformance reverse — as long as no new issues arise,"" he said.
The scandal came to light following an investigation into the bank's cross-selling program — a practice in which employees were pushed to sell as many products to customers as possible across multiple lines. Initially, the company said some 2 million accounts were involved.
Fallout from the scandal saw the former CEO and other executives pushed out. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has called for the removal of all the board members who were in place during the time in question.
The bank already has paid a $185 million fine and settled a class-action suit for $142 million. Additional refunds and compensation are expected to cost $10.7 million more, Kleinhanzl said. The payouts are not expected to have a material impact on earnings.
However, he noted that the bank still has outstanding issues regarding auto and collateral protection insurance. Previous revelations indicated that Wells had been putting some customers into auto insurance plans they didn't need. The bank has said it will refund $80 million to 570,000 affected customers.

 Latest disclosure should bring closure to Wells Fargo scandal: Scott Siefers   
 7:59  PM ET Thu, 31 Aug 2017 |  02:28 
 Sandler O'Neill + Partners says Wells Fargo's announcement on Thursday that it found 1.4 million more potentially unauthorized account openings than previously thought isn't as bad as it seems because the bank reviewed a longer time period.
 ""It's important to keep this in context. Yes, the number of affected accounts was up by 65 percent or so, but it is important to bear in mind they basically doubled the amount of time in their review,"" banking analyst Scott Siefers said in a CNBC ""Power Lunch"" interview Thursday. ""Hopefully [with] today's disclosure … this should help to bring some closure to this facet of Wells Fargo's scandal."" The bank revealed on Thursday it uncovered the additional potentially unauthorized consumer and small-business accounts after an independent investigation into a sales scandal that erupted last year. However, the Sandler O'Neill analyst said Wells Fargo is still facing other fundamental issues such as weaker sales growth and potential problems in various business segments. ""Wells Fargo investors have to wrestle with what's been a slowing top line revenue growth trend,"" he said. ""There's still a litany of uncertainties out there. In that vein I think that the [valuation] discount is warranted still."" Wells Fargo declined to comment for this story.

 Disney's upcoming internet video streaming services will thrive, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Wells Fargo raised its rating on Disney shares to outperform from market perform. Disney announced plans last month to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018. ""With Disney's foray into direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming, we can't help but believe the TV ecosystem will soon embark on an accelerated over-the-top (OTT) path,"" analyst Marci Ryvicker wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""Thus, investors may need to start thinking about increasing exposure to those media cos. with solid streaming strategies, such as … Disney."" Disney has underperformed the market this year with its shares down 3 percent in 2017 through Friday, compared with the S&P 500's 11 percent return. Ryvicker raised her price target for Disney to $116 from $109, representing 14 percent upside from Friday's close. Ryvicker said Disney's new entertainment streaming service will replace Netflix as the exclusive site for Disney and Pixar-branded movies when it launches. She also noted the company's valuation of 15 times forward price to earnings was the ""trough"" level where the shares bottomed out during the previous four years. ""We like the entry point for DIS even if we're early. … We view the risk/reward as heavily skewed to the upside,"" she wrote. ""We continue to believe Disney is a premium brand with one of the best management teams in media."" Shares of Disney rose 1 percent in early trading Tuesday.

 Sen. Warren: WFC misdeeds all about juicing reported profits   
 7:16  PM ET Tue, 19 Sept 2017 |  00:46 
 Few lawmakers had stronger words for Wells Fargo in the continued conflict surrounding the big bank's malpractices than Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
 ""This is a company that, from the very top, has made it clear there's no accountability here,"" the Democratic senator told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer in an exclusive interview on Tuesday.
While Wells Fargo's earnings remained intact, the bank is said to have pressured employees to open unauthorized accounts for customers, an issue that was recently found to have affected more customer accounts than previously thought.
 ""This is not about serving consumers,"" Warren said. ""This is all about, quarter by quarter by quarter, how to juice the reported profits. That's what mattered at Wells Fargo.""
And to Warren, the only way to prevent large corporations from misdeeds like these are to hold their top executives accountable, possibly with the help of the Federal Reserve.
""So long as there is no personal responsibility when these big companies breach consumers' trusts, let their data get stolen, cheat their consumers like they did in the case of Wells Fargo, then nothing is going to change,"" the senator said. ""As long as they can keep collecting their paychecks and they can keep sleeping cozy at night, then we're going to have the same kind of thing going on in these big corporations where the customer is at the end of the day – and let's face it – stockholders are at the end of the day, too. It's all about the executives.""
Warren recalled how ousted Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf handled the news of his bank's cross-selling malpractices in his Senate hearing.
""We had a hearing a year ago when John Stumpf, who had gone on your program, first one out of the barrel, said, 'Hey, listen, I take personal responsibility for what's gone wrong at Wells Fargo.' And then it turned out what personal responsibility meant was firing thousands of people who made $15 bucks an hour,"" Warren told Cramer.
In light of the recent cybersecurity breach at credit reporting firm Equifax, in which hackers gained access to 143 million customers' Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and even driver's license and credit card numbers, Warren called for policymakers to take stronger action against top executives.
Stumpf may have been fired, but many of the executives who were there while Wells Fargo employees were under pressure to meet sales quotas still have their jobs, Warren said.
""I want these big corporations to understand that when you engage in massive fraud, when you are so irresponsible with the data that belongs to consumers, when you put your customers at risk, there's going to be real responsibility for you,"" the senator said. ""And until that happens, until people lose their jobs, until we have criminal investigations, until there's a real chance that one of these executives is going to be walked out of the office in handcuffs with people snapping pictures, then nothing's going to change on Wall Street, not in these big companies.""

 Wells Fargo report: 20% of millennials say they'll never invest in markets   
 3:17  PM ET Thu, 28 Sept 2017 |  04:22 
 When it comes to money, millennials are less than confident about the markets, says Kristi Mitchem, Wells Fargo Asset Management CEO.
 A study the bank recently commissioned on millennials and money found that 20 percent of young people said they will ""never"" be invested in the markets while 53 percent said they will ""never be comfortable investing in the markets.""
The bank surveyed more than 1,700 individuals between the ages of 20 and 36 to gauge their financial literacy and their relationship with money and their opinions about the markets.
 ""I think that lack of confidence is something that we really need to find a way to work through with them. If they continue at this rate, they will never have enough savings for retirement. Ever,"" Mitchem said on CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""
""Helping them think through these issues and really understand how important it is to not just to save, but invest I think is critical,"" she said.
More from Smart Investing: Bitcoin too risky for ""serious"" investing, say advisors What investors should do before market gets gored
With average student debt now $34,144, up 62 percent over the last 10 years, it's not hard to accept that millennials aren't feeling great about their finances. But for the sake of their future happiness, Mitchem said it's time to get over the anxiety.
Wells Fargo came up with a Positive Financial Indicator (PFI) to test how well an individual is doing financially. It consists of five attributes of an individual in good financial standing:
 I have enough money to be able to save for future needs. I am saving enough for retirement. I feel in control of my financial life. I take an active role in setting and achieving goals. I am able to pay for monthly expenses. 
Interestingly, the bank found that those who score higher on the PFI tend to be happier and more confident with their money.
""So really, really important — engagement actually drives happiness. And that's a connection, that millennials don't understand,"" Mitchem said. ""Finances do matter to them.""
""Activism actually creates more confidence. Grandparents who have millennial grandchildren, parents who have millennial children, talk to your millennials about money and finance. Don't give them fish, don't teach them how to fish, fish with them,"" she added.

 7:02  PM ET Tue, 19 Sept 2017 |  10:19 
 A Wells Fargo spokesperson defended the bank's efforts to restore trust on Tuesday, emphasizing an internal checklist meant to address former malpractices.
 The response came after Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) reiterated her criticism of the bank's improper sales procedures and called on the Federal Reserve to remove Wells Fargo's board of directors.
""Wells Fargo's Board and management team have taken many actions in response to retail sales practices issues, including changes in senior leadership, eliminating product sales goals for retail bankers as well as numerous steps to make things right with any customer affected by unacceptable sales practices,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email to CNBC. ""That work — including a $142 million class action settlement — continues and remains a core part of our efforts to build a better Wells Fargo for the future.""
 The checklist, referred to as a ""Progress Report,"" cites the various reforms Wells Fargo has made or plans to make to restore trust with customers, shareholders and employees.
Already-completed items include electing Tim Sloan as the bank's CEO, terminating managers connected to the improper sales practices, refunding afflicted customers, getting rid of lofty sales goals, raising the minimum wage for U.S.-based employees and boosting ethics standards, according to Wells Fargo.
Initiatives still in progress include increasing oversight at community branches, reforming hiring processes and notifying customers of the class-action settlement and the bank's commitment to preventing further malpractices.
The bank also vows to remediate over $80 million to customers affected by problems with the bank's auto Collateral Protection Insurance.
The final item on the checklist reads, ""[Begin] the roll out of transformational changes to processes, coaching and customer interaction within the Community Bank to take customer and team member experience to a new level.""
On Wednesday, credit rating agency DBRS downgraded Wells Fargo from AA to AA (low) because of its fake-account scandal. In August, an independent investigation found that Wells Fargo employees had opened nearly double the number of unauthorized accounts as the bank had originally stated.

 Sen. Warren: WFC misdeeds all about juicing reported profits   
 7:16  PM ET Tue, 19 Sept 2017 |  00:46 
 Wells Fargo's troubles with its fake-account scandal have earned the bank a credit downgrade from a ratings agency.
 DBRS announced Wednesday that it is taking down the Wells rating from AA to AA (low). That's essentially a step and a half below top-rated, but still well within the range of investment-grade.
The move is in reaction to the growing costs the third-largest U.S. bank by assets faces regarding the scandal, in which customers were enrolled in programs without their consent or knowledge.
 ""The one-notch rating downgrade reflects operational and management missteps at the Company and resultant reputational damage stemming from ongoing issues surrounding the Company's sales practices, as well as practices impacting other consumer-related areas,"" DBRS said in a statement.
Wells Fargo has admitted that as many as 3.5 million accounts were involved. Employees under pressure to meet aggressive sales goals enrolled customers in multiple products. Though the practice had been ongoing for years, it only came to public light a year ago when Wells agreed to pay a $185 million settlement with various authorities.
 Rick Wilking | Reuters
A customer leaves an ATM at a Wells Fargo branch in Denver.
 Since then, other disclosures have arisen. The practices also extended to enrolling customers in auto insurance that they didn't need, and the bank paid a $142 million class-action settlement. It also has said it will pay $2.8 million in refunds to affected customers.
""As the Company works to address the issues, expenses have been elevated and revenue growth in some areas has softened,"" DBRS said. ""Additionally, negative headlines are likely to remain an ongoing risk, as the Company faces heightened regulatory scrutiny, litigation, as well as additional investigations and the ongoing challenge of evolving the culture of the organization.""
While DBRS said the problems place ""a degree of uncertainty"" over Wells, the agency said the bank otherwise looks solid. Wells is approaching its problems ""from a position of strength,"" DBRS said.
""Despite growing expenses and a worsening efficiency ratio, the Company continues to outperform many global peers,"" the agency added.
Wells Fargo's position remains strong in deposit share, commercial and consumer banking and other areas of financial operations.
However, shares this year have performed poorly, down 3.2 percent year to date compared with a 4 percent gain for the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index.
Wells Fargo declined to comment.

 Yellen: Wells Fargo's behavior towards customers egregious and unacceptable   
 3:31  PM ET Wed, 20 Sept 2017 |  01:02 
 Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen blasted Wells Fargo for the bank's fake-account scandal, though she stopped short of what actions the central bank may take.
 Responding to a question at her quarterly news conference, Yellen called Wells Fargo's actions ""egregious and unacceptable.""
The bank has been under fire for the past year after it admitted that thousands of employees enrolled customers in programs without their knowledge or consent. The workers were attempting to meet aggressive sales goals that have since been abandoned. Wells Fargo has admitted that about 3.5 million accounts were affected.
 The Fed chair herself has come under some fire, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., calling for Yellen to dismiss all the Wells Fargo board members in place when the scandal took place.
""We take our supervision responsibilities very seriously,"" Yellen said. ""We are attempting to understand what the root causes of some of those problems are and to address them.""
However, she stopped short of saying what regulatory actions the Fed might take.
""I'm not able to discuss confidential supervisory information, and not yet able to tell you what actions we may take,"" she said, promising only ""to make sure that the right set of controls are in place"" at Wells Fargo.
The bank paid a $185 million settlement last year with multiple authorities, then added another $142 million earlier this year to settle a class-action suit. In addition, Wells Fargo has admitted that customers were enrolled in auto insurance programs that they didn't need.Wells Fargo said in response to Yellen's comments that its ""Board and management team have taken many actions in response to retail sales practices issues, including changes in senior leadership, eliminating product sales goals for retail bankers as well as numerous steps to make things right with any customer affected by unacceptable sales practices. That work - including a $142 million class action settlement – continues and remains a core part of our efforts to build a better Wells Fargo for the future.""

 Wells Fargo issues first outlook for 2018 from Wall Street and it's not bullish   
 3:05  PM ET Thu, 21 Sept 2017 |  00:48 
 The Wells Fargo Investment Institute doesn't expect the S&P 500 to rise more than 2 percent over the next 15 months, according to the firm's 2018 year-end outlook released Thursday. 
 While some Wall Street strategists have included 2018 S&P targets in their equities notes, the Wells Fargo note marks the first major outlook report for next year.
Wells Fargo gave a range of 2,450 to 2,550 for the S&P next year, a decline of 2.3 percent or a rise of nearly 1.7 percent from Wednesday's record close of 2,508.24. The S&P 500 also hit an intraday high Wednesday of 2,508.85.
 ""The synchronized global recovery that took hold in 2017 should gain in 2018, though restrained by ongoing global headwinds from high debt, slow labor recoveries overseas and political uncertainties around the world,"" Wells Fargo's global investment strategy team wrote in a Monday note that was distributed to the media Thursday.
""We also anticipate that earnings gains will fuel moderately higher U.S. and international equity markets,"" the report said. The strategists added that since the U.S. economy is likely in the ""final third"" of expansion, investors must be particularly aware of risks.
In late August, the Wells Fargo Investment Institute raised its 2017 year-end target range by 70 points to 2,300 to 2,400. At the time, the increase still forecast, at best, a roughly 1 percent decline for the S&P.
Among 15 strategists surveyed by CNBC last year, Wells Fargo Investment Institute's Scott Wren came the closest to predicting where the S&P would end the year, albeit at a range. The middle of his target range was 2,240, and the S&P ended 2016 at 2,238.83.

 Strategist sees oil heading to $60   
 2:07  PM ET Tue, 26 Sept 2017 |  01:43 
 Crude is on pace for its best month since April 2016, and one Wells Fargo strategist says there's still room to run in the crude rally.
 Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, says that a ""backwardation"" has appeared in the oil futures that could take oil up to $60, which it hasn't hit since July 2015. A backwardation occurs when futures contracts expiring at later dates are trading lower than current prices, which according to Wren is being seen now in oil.
This, Wren says, means there is less of an incentive to store oil into the future and hedge against it, which usually leads to higher oil prices in the short-term.
 ""It's a backwardation setup right now rather than the regular contango kind of formation,"" he explained Tuesday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""And so people are buying oil in the front months.""
 But this momentum can only reach a certain point, says the strategist. Wren expects rig counts to rise in the coming months along with production, thereby increasing the supply of oil versus demand. This increase in supply versus demand, says Wren, could send oil prices back to $40 by year-end.
Anthony Grisanti, founder of GRZ Energy, believes that $52.30 to $52.60 is the ""next level of resistance"" for oil given that he sees demand for oil dropping in October.
Based on Tuesday's levels, when crude oil was just 10 cents away from $52, Grisanti sees oil making a downturn soon.
As of Tuesday afternoon, crude was on track to break a 4-day winning streak.

 Stocks likely to end 2017 on sour note, says Wells Fargo’s Scott Wren   
 3:21  PM ET Tue, 26 Sept 2017 |  01:13 
 The stock market could come within a hair of a correction in the next three months, Wells Fargo says.
 Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, sees problems for the S&P 500 as the record year comes to a close.
""Our midpoint of our target range for year-end 2018 is 2,500,""  Wren said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""We're basically there right now.""
 Wren is predicting a 4 to 8 percent dip from current levels before year's end. The official definition of a correction is a 10 percent drop.
It appears his forecast may already be materializing. Just look at the Dow. The index is on its first four-day losing streak since June.
But it's important to note that it has been a banner year for stocks. The Dow has soared nearly 13 percent while the S&P 500 is up 12 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has also reaped big gains, surging nearly 19 percent this year.
""Valuations are meaningfully stretched in that the trailing 12 month P/E ration on the S&P 500 is 20 and change. And, that's against about a 16½ 30-year median,"" Wren said.
With stocks on the expensive side, an economy that's ""not really accelerating"" and a Federal Reserve that's firmly executing its rate-hike policy — Wren doesn't see much upside left.
""The net net move between now and the end of 2018 is probably going to be pretty small,"" he added.
There's a silver lining in Wren's 2017 downward spiral forecast. His year-end S&P 500 price target for 2018 is 2,450 to 2,550, which would suggest solid gains next year.
""That would give us say a 5 to 8 percent return [in 2018],"" Wren said. ""I think we're going to have an opportunity to buy some stocks.""

 Amazon gets its most bullish Wall Street call yet: $1,400 price forecast   
 12:29  PM ET Wed, 27 Sept 2017 |  00:41 
 Amazon shares are faltering this month along with many of its large-cap technology company peers. But the pullback is a buying opportunity, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Wells Fargo Securities began coverage of Amazon with an outperform rating on its shares and a price target of $1,400, which is 49 percent above Tuesday's closing price. It is also the highest target out of the 42 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet.
Wells' analyst predicts the internet giant will be able to use artificial intelligence and data analysis to dominate new industries.
 ""Given a strong customer experience, scaled infrastructure investments, high user engagement, and lead within Cloud, we believe AMZN is among the best positioned to apply these neural network advances [artificial intelligence] across new verticals/industries,"" analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We see this lead in data, coupled with the company's edge in compute efficiency, as increasingly feeding insights into supply chain, for its retail, video, and other efforts, and through AWS, for its partners.""
Amazon shares have rallied 25 percent this year through Tuesday, compared with the market's 12 percent gain. But the stock is down 4 percent this month compared with the S&P 500's 1 percent gain.
Amazon Web Services has 46 percent of the ""infrastructure-as-a-service"" commercial cloud computing market. Sena noted that the research firm IDC estimates the total public cloud computing market will grow to more than $200 billion by 2020. He also predicts the company can gain market share in the apparel, over-the-counter medicine and grocery product categories, which represent another $130 billion of potential sales in the U.S.
The e-commerce giant operates on a so-called flywheel model in which low prices, repeat shoppers and a positive experience for buyers and sellers create a self-perpetuating cycle of growth. ""We see Amazon's famous flywheel as spinning with increasingly impenetrable force, where customer experience, frequency, and data will only grow,"" he wrote.
Amazon shares are up 0.7 percent in the Wednesday premarket session after the report.

 Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan: Our initial actions were insufficient   
 10:32  AM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  02:30 
 Wells Fargo CEO  Tim Sloan faces grilling before the Senate Banking Committee as Wells Fargo continues to try to put its fake account scandal in the past.
Fargo outlined a string of reforms the bank has put into place since the issue came to light in September 2016.
 However, committee members are likely to continue to hammer on the bank for its conduct.
""The changes Mr. Sloan and his team have made are not sufficient to reform a corporate culture that is willing to abuse its customers and employees in an effort to pad its numbers and increase executive compensation,"" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said at the start of the hearing.
Investigators and the bank have revealed that some 3.5 million accounts were affected by conduct in which employees enrolled customers into accounts without their knowledge. The cross-selling was done to meet aggressive sales goals that since have been terminated.
The bank has shelled out more than $300 million in fines as well as settlement costs associated with a class-action suit. In addition, it has ended its relationship with several senior executives including former CEO John Stumpf.

Tim Sloan, president and chief executive officer of Wells Fargo & Co.
 Sloan promised that more changes are on the way.
""Wells Fargo is a better bank today than it was a year ago. And next year, Wells Fargo will be a better bank than it is today,"" he said in remarks prepared for a Senate hearing Tuesday.
Wells Fargo has rehired more than one-third of the employees it axed in the wake of the bank's fake accounts scandal, Sloan said. 
In total, more than 1,780 of the 5,200 or so workers dismissed as the result of Wells Fargo's wayward cross-selling practices are back on the job, Sloan said.
The rehirings were part of the bank's commitment ""to the former Wells Fargo team members who were affected by the Community Bank's old ways of doing things,"" he said.
""Those folks coming back agreeing to be part of the team reinforces the changes we're making in the community bank are taking hold,"" Sloan said during the question-and-answer part of his testimony.
Still, shareholders haven't been convinced.
The stock has only recently turned positive thanks to a late-September rally, but is barely positive during a year in which the S&P 500 has surged 13 percent and bank stocks otherwise, as gauged by the SPDR S&P Bank ETF, have risen 4.3 percent.
In addition to the rehirings, Sloan said the bank is making a number of other reforms and is continuing to reimburse affected customers. Wells will provide an additional $2.8 million on top of the $3.3 million it already has refunded. The bank also is sending ""mystery shoppers"" to various branches to make sure sales practices are above-board.
""We are resolving past problems even as we make changes to ensure nothing like this happens again at Wells Fargo,"" Sloan said.

 Time to move on from Wells Fargo?   
 9:51  AM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  03:20 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday that Americans will move on from Wells Fargo's accounts scandal after the bank chief's Tim Sloan hearing on Capitol Hill.
 Speaking just before Sloan's testimony at a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Cramer said there should have been more consequences for the bank.
""He will do a fabulous job,"" Cramer said of Sloan's appearance. ""And then there will be some more articles. ... and then we'll move on because it is America.""
 ""I do not think that Wells Fargo should have gotten away as easily as they did,"" The ""Mad Money"" host added on ""Squawk on the Street.""
In prepared testimony, Sloan apologized for the creation of unauthorized accounts and said the bank has hired back more than 1,000 workers who were wrongly fired or left under a cloud.
Cramer has been critical of Wells Fargo since the bank admitted that as many as 3.5 million accounts were created for customers without their permission. The scandal led to the departure of multiple executives, including former CEO John Stumpf.
""I thought the report was outrageous,"" Cramer said Tuesday. ""Did anyone else say it was outrageous? What happens when they issue a report and I'm the only guy who says it's outrageous.""
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC earlier Tuesday that he still has ""faith"" in Wells Fargo. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is Wells Fargo's largest shareholder, holding a 9.4 percent stake.  
""Somebody messed up, and the job is to find out who messed up,"" Buffett said on ""Squawk Box.""

 Warren Buffett: Keeping our Wells Fargo holding just under 10%   
 9:14  AM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  01:31 
 Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said Tuesday that he still believes in the CEO of Wells Fargo after the fake accounts fallout at the bank.
 ""Tim Sloan has my faith,"" said Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. ""When you find a problem, you have to jump on it.""
""Somebody messed up and the job is to find out who messed up,"" he added in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
 Berkshire is Wells Fargo's largest shareholder, holding a 9.4 percent stake.
When asked whether he sold any shares of Wells Fargo, Buffett said ""only enough to stay under 10 percent, which was something the Fed requires.""
On Tuesday, Wells CEO Tim Sloan will appear before the Senate Banking Committee. In prepared testimony, Sloan apologized for the creation of unauthorized accounts and said the bank has hired back more than 1,000 workers who were wrongly fired or left under a cloud.
In late August, Wells admitted that as many as 3.5 million accounts were created for customers without their permission. That's nearly 70 percent more than originally thought. The scandal led to the departure of multiple executives, including former CEO John Stumpf.
Buffett told CNBC on Aug. 31, ""There's never just one cockroach in the kitchen when you start looking around.""
""You may very well find that it wasn't just the one who misbehaved that you find out about,"" he said.
While the practice had been going on for years at the bank, it only became public last year, when Wells agreed to pay a $185 million settlement with regulators.
Since then, it was revealed that the tactics extended to enrolling customers in auto insurance that they didn't need. Wells paid a $142 million class-action settlement and $2.8 million in refunds to affected customers.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told CNBC last month that the Wells Fargo board should be removed by Federal Reserve regulators.
Buffett on Tuesday joined ""Squawk Box"" from Omaha, Nebraska — the home of Berkshire and where Purpose Built Communities was holding its annual conference. Buffett is co-founder of Purpose Built, along with the investor Julian Robertson. The nonprofit consulting firm helps communities revitalize neighborhoods.

 Elizabeth Warren to Wells Fargo CEO: You should be fired   
 1:26  PM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  03:03 
 Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday demanded that Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan be fired, arguing that he was part of a culture that pushed the bank to create millions of fake accounts for customers without their knowledge.
 ""At best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said during Sloan's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee. ""Either way, you should be fired.""
Other members of the committee also pressed Sloan about how the bank could have allowed the sales scandal to get so out of control.
 ""What in God's name were you thinking?"" asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana.
As many as 3.5 million accounts were involved as employees tried to meet aggressive cross-selling goals that have since been scrapped.
 Susan Walsh | AP
Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer and President Timothy Sloan testifies before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2017, during a hearing on Wells Fargo after one year.
 Though Sloan said he believes the bank was making strides in restoring its reputation, Warren and others weren't impressed.
""Wells Fargo needs to start over, and that won't happen until the bank rids itself of people like you who led it into this crisis,"" said Warren, who previously had demanded that the 12 board members in place during the scandal be removed.
Warren pushed Sloan on comments and transcripts she found in news articles and earnings calls that she said showed the CEO was bragging about the bank's sales ability even as he knew about the cross-selling problems.
""I've read through them, and on these calls no one, not even John Stumpf, who was the CEO at the time, bragged more about Wells Fargo's ability and commitment to open new accounts for existing customers,"" Warren said, referring to earnings calls between 2011 and 2014.
""I'm proud of the credit card products we have at Wells Fargo,"" Sloan responded.
Sloan defended his role at the bank, sidestepping questions over why he hadn't acted sooner and instead focusing on the steps he was taking now. Sloan was chief operating officer before succeeding Stumpf, who was forced out as CEO last October, a month after the bank settled charged with regulators over the cross-selling practice.
Sloan outlined a number of steps Wells Fargo is taking to improve operations and prevent a similar scandal.
"" I don't believe your criticisms of the board are accurate,"" he later said. ""I think the reason I am the right person to run this company today, notwithstanding your criticisms, is because I have been making change at this company for 30 years.""
""I'm not afraid to make hard decisions when it's needed, and I have the support of 270,000 people,"" he said, referring to the bank's employees. ""That's why I think I'm the right person.""
""Are you kidding?"" Warren responded.
Their exchange continued later, with Warren charging that Wells Fargo was planning to lay off thousands of employees to meet shareholder profit expectations.
Addressing committee chair Sen. Michael Crapo (R-Idaho) on the broader issue with the banks, she said, ""The only way we're ever going to stop these scandals is to hold executives personally accountable, to fire the people who are responsible and when they break the law to march them out in handcuffs.""
""I couldn't disagree more with almost everything Sen. Warren said,"" Sloan responded.
Warren also went after Sloan's predecessor at a hearing last year. She called for a criminal investigation into Wells Fargo executives and told Stumpf he should resign.

 Elizabeth Warren to Wells Fargo CEO: You should be fired   
 1:26  PM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  03:03 
 On Tuesday, Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan appeared before the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill regarding the bank's creation of unauthorized accounts.
 What follows is a full transcript of the exchange between Senator Elizabeth Warren and Sloan during Tuesday's hearing. 
Senator Elizabeth Warren: I want to take a look at your time at Wells Fargo. From 2011 to 2014, at the height of when Wells Fargo was cheating customers by opening false accounts, you served as the chief financial officer. As CFO, you spoke to potential Wells Fargo investors a lot. On those calls, you aggressively promoted Wells Fargo ability to open up new accounts, didn't you?
 Tim Sloan: No. I didn't.
Warren: No, you didn't?
Sloan: No.
Warren: Well, here are the transcripts from all of the investors' earnings calls that you participated in from 2011 to 2014. I've read through them and on these calls no one, not even John Stumpf who was the CEO at the time, bragged more about Wells Fargo's ability and commitment to open new accounts for existing customers. In the April, 2011, call for example, I think I've marked that one, you said, 'I can't wait to get a credit card in every one of our credit worthy customer's wallets.' Nothing about whether your customers wanted or needed a Wells Fargo credit card. All that mattered was opening new accounts. So while you were bragging to investors, about opening new accounts on these calls, from 2011 to 2014, you also personally owned roughly 2 million shares of Wells-Fargo stocks. Is that right?
Sloan: Senator, I don't recall how much stock I owned in Wells Fargo. I'm a very proud shareholder.
Warren: Well, it's actually in your SEC filing.
Sloan: Sure! It's public. It's all out there.
Warren: So it looks like you had a really good thing going. Talk up Wells Fargo's ability to open new accounts, get investors excited, and hey, if the stock goes up by a dollar, you make a cool $2 million bucks. Then in December 2013, almost three years into your time as CFO, the LA Times published a large article on the relentless pressure Wells Fargo put on employees to open new accounts. The article was based on an internal review of Wells Fargo documents, court filings, interviews with more than 30 current and former Wells Fargo employees. The article specifically said that employees had opened fake accounts in response to this pressure. Now, you were interviewed for that piece, Mr. Sloan, and you said, 'I'm not aware of any overbearing sales culture.' Hmm, that is really interesting phrasing: 'I'm not aware.' So when the LA Times came to you with concrete evidence of a terrible problem with fake accounts at your bank, did you launch an investigation into the issue before brushing it off?
Sloan: Senator, as it relates to my comments in 2011, I'm proud of the credit card products that we have at Wells Fargo.
Warren: That's not the question I'm asking. I just asked — you brushed it off. You said, 'you're not aware of problem.' Did you open an investigation when someone laid out evidence of fake accounts?
Sloan: Senator, in that interview, to the best of my recollection with the LA Times, they didn't provide me with any information. It was soon after that –
Warren: So I take that as a no? You did not open an inquiry into it?
Sloan: Again, the LA Times did not provide me with any documents. It was a phone call…
Warren: Did you read the article?
Sloan: I read the article, yes.
Warrem: …And then you opened an investigation immediately?
Sloan: At the same time the article was coming out, that was the time when the community bank elevated this issue to the senior leadership team and that's the time that we began to take action.
Warren: So let's talk about that time. You didn't look into the fake accounts. But you went right back to pumping up the stock price by bragging about Wells Fargo's record number of new accounts on your very next investor call. Now let's fast forward to 2016, two months before the fake account scandal became public. You were then the Chief Operating Officer of Wells Fargo. An interviewer asked you whether you'd brought sales goals and cross-selling too far, and your answer was 'No. The fundamental strategy we have is not going to change.' In July 2016, just before this breaks open, according to Wells Fargo's own investigation, you knew that thousands of employees had been fired for opening fake accounts and other sales violations. You knew that aggressive cross-selling goals were to blame and still, you publicly said that the bank didn't have a problem. Right?
Sloan: Uh, Senator, that's incorrect, you --
Warren: --You didn't say this? That --
Sloan: Senator, could you read the entire quote and can we go through the entire presentation because I think in that presentation --
Warren: Your answer when asked if you pushed employees to far, your answer was 'no. The fundamental strategy we have is not going to change.' And that's a month before before this break was public.
Sloan: And I was referring to, I was referring to the vision of our company.
Warren: The vision, including the fake scandals you're being asking about?
Sloan: No, Senator. Every time I give a presentation to our team members, I start with our vision, which is the ground people and the culture of our company, which is that our job is to satisfy our customer's financial needs and help them succeed financially.
Warren: Mr. Sloan, I--
Sloan: --That's the context I made that statement. Since I've become CEO, I have made fundamental changes to address the issues that we're talking about today.
Warren: Mr. Sloan, you were asked about pressure on employees, which caused the fake accounts scandal. We all know that now -- it's public. You knew there was a problem, and when you were asked about it, you lied. This is about personal responsibility. Wells Fargo cheated millions of people for years. The Federal Reserve should remove all of the current board members who served during the fake account scandal. And Mr. Sloan, you say you've been making changes at Wells Fargo for 30 years, but you enabled this fake account scam, you got rich off it, and then you tried to cover it up. At best, you are incompetent. At worst, you are complicit. Either way, you should be fired. Wells Fargo needs to start over and that won't happen until the bank rids itself of people like you who led it into this crisis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Sloan: Mr. Chairman, could I respond to that?
Chairman: Yes, you may.
Warren: I want an equal amount of time.
Sloan: Senator, I think a couple things. First -- and I'll get to your criticism of me in a moment -- but first let's talk about the board. I think the board has taken very important steps in terms of a thorough, independent investigation that's been made public, that's number one. Number two, the board has taken very strong action in terms of executive accountability. That is, unfortunately, some of the highest in corporate American history. Again, unfortunate. So I don't believe that your criticism of the board are accurate. As it relates to me, again, I think the reason that I'm the right person to run this company today, notwithstanding your criticism, is because I have been making changes at this company for 30 years. I have made mistakes, I certainly haven't been perfect, but I think having that knowledge of the company, having the ability to make the change, the actions that I've taken since I've become CEO 11 months ago, have made fundamental change at this company. So I'm not afraid to make hard decisions when it's needed, and I have the support of 247,000 people. That's why I think I'm the right person.
Warren: [to Chairman] Can I just make a short comment on this? I know we're, I know we're over [time], but I really want to say, [to Sloan] are you kidding? You know, look. You've been there for 30 years and every one of my colleagues, on both the Republican side and the Democratic side, who have spoken so far have talked about a broken culture at Wells Fargo, have talked about the fact that the problem starts with leadership. The people who were there and leaving Wells Fargo during the time of a years long scam, and multiple scams as our Chairman pointed out, those people should not be left in charge of this business. And when you promote it, exactly what was wrong with this bank, over and over and over -- you went to the stock market, and you bragged about it. You made money personally off it. When you were asked about it, you did not tell the truth, and you tried to cover it up. Wells Fargo is not going to change with you in charge.

 Senator Tester: Wells Fargo CEO is trying to do the right thing   
 2:46  PM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  03:22 
 One Democratic senator isn't going as far as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who called for the ouster of Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan on Tuesday.
 Sloan faced a grilling on Capitol Hill about the bank's fake accounts scandal.
""Tim Sloan's trying to do the right thing,"" Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., said in an interview with CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""
 That said, Tester said he's still fighting to make sure that wrongs are righted.
""They screwed up and they need to fix it. They need to fix this culture that's gone on in their banking system for far too long,"" he said.

Wells Fargo & Company CEO and President Tim Sloan testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, October 3, 2017.
 Wells Fargo has admitted employees enrolled customers in programs without their knowledge in an effort to meet aggressive sales goals. About 3.5 million accounts were affected.
Warren contended at the hearing that Sloan was part of a culture that pushed the bank to create the fake accounts.
""At best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit,"" she said. ""Either way, you should be fired.""
Sloan said he believes the bank was making strides in restoring its reputation and promised more changes are on the way.

 Dick Bove: Tim Sloan is doing a superb job and shouldn't be fired   
 3:28  PM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  02:40 
 Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan is doing a ""superb job"" in restoring the company, but widely followed banking analyst Dick Bove told CNBC he's still not buying the stock.
 Sloan testified about the bank's fake account scandal before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.
""Tim Sloan has taken huge efforts to try to turn this company around and re-establish its credibility,"" the equity research analyst at the Vertical Group said in an interview with ""Closing Bell"" on Tuesday.
 However, his problem with Wells Fargo comes down to the fundamentals.
""For the last seven years they haven't been able to increase their operating earnings. And they haven't been able to increase them in the last 12 months,"" Bove said. ""Now they're facing a restructuring of the business at a time when they need to do something to show they can increase sales and earnings and it isn't happening.""

""At best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said.
Sloan said he believes the bank was making strides in restoring its reputation and promised more changes are on the way.
Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett is still a believer in Wells Fargo and its CEO. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's largest shareholder, holding a 9.4 percent stake.
When asked whether he sold any shares of Wells Fargo, the billionaire investor said ""only enough to stay under 10 percent, which was something the Fed requires.""
Marty Mosby, director of banks and equity strategies at Vining Sparks, is also bullish. He believes Wells Fargo will re-establish itself next year as the headlines go away and headwinds to earnings disappear.
""You'll see the earnings growth come back as we look into 2018 and 2019,"" he told ""Closing Bell.""
Mosby has a strong buy rating and a $65 price target on the bank, although he doesn't think the stock will outperform much through year-end.
""Wells Fargo is a long-term investment,"" he said. ""While they are at all-time highs, relative to the group they've underperformed since the announcement of this crisis a year ago by over 20 percent. So there's some relative value in Wells Fargo that you can catch.""
Bove thinks that with the stock just a few points shy of its all-time high, it's ""pretty clear"" that people are no longer looking at what companies are producing and the quality of their loan portfolios.
""All they're looking at is some mythical theory that if interest rates go way up that bank earnings will go way up,"" he said.
Bank stocks surged after the Federal Reserve indicated in September that another rate hike was possible this year.

 Cramer's problem with Wells Fargo's hearing   
 7:10  PM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  01:05 
 For a long time, CNBC's Jim Cramer actually liked the stock of the now scandal-ridden Wells Fargo.
 ""Long story short: we loved the stock of Wells Fargo for the very thing that ultimately got them in trouble: the cross-selling. We thought the bank had this unique business model where it was able to cross-sell products to individuals who do more than just open a savings account,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
In light of Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan's heated testimony beforethe Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, Cramer looked back at the bank's once-captivating model.
 ""'How can I get more of your business?' was always the signature line of anyone involved with Wells Fargo. Candidly, I truly believed they did it better than anyone else,"" he said.
But that was before news emerged that the big bank's cross-selling efforts were largely fraudulent and worsened by lofty sales quotas placed on its employees.
Cramer's biggest disappointment was that Sloan, a 30-year veteran of the company that served as chief financial officer and chief operating officer before taking over as CEO, tried to skirt questions about the cross-selling practices.
""I wish he'd just made the case that Wall Street was willing to pay a higher price-to-earnings multiple for shares of his bank precisely because of its apparent success at cross-selling,"" Cramer said. ""That's just the truth — for years, it was why investors, including my charitable trust, owned the darned thing.""
The ""Mad Money"" host figured that Sloan didn't want to tarnish his reputation as an executive by admitting that the cross-selling methods Wells Fargo was so proud of turned out to be bogus.
But even as Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for Sloan's firing, something that the Federal Reserve has the power to do, Cramer doesn't expect much to come out of the hearing.
""The only resignation I expect here is from the people like me who are resigned to the idea that nothing more will be done,"" he said. ""As I said to my partners on 'Squawk on the Street' this morning, this is America, where people who commit white-collar crimes for corporations rarely suffer anything worse than some firings and some clawbacks and some nasty looks at the supermarket.""
So, despite Warren's fiery words and Congress' seemingly stern song-and-dance, Cramer figures little will ultimately be done to make sure Wells Fargo changes its fraught company culture.
""Beyond that, I guess I could tell you to buy the stock, but ... I like so many other bank stocks more because it turns out that Wells Fargo's past strength was illusory,"" Cramer said. ""Before the scandal broke, the stock got a premium valuation because of the cross-selling. Now that's gone and it's just another bank. There are zillions of 'em out there, many both cheaper and better.""

CEO and President of Wells Fargo & Company Timothy Sloan testifies during a hearing before Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee October 3, 2017 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.
 Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said Sen. Elizabeth Warren took his past comments out of context at Tuesday's Senate Banking Committee hearing about the bank's fake accounts scandal.
 During the hearing, the Massachusetts Democrat pressed Sloan on comments she said she found in news articles and earnings calls. Warren alleged Sloan, who was chief operating officer before becoming CEO, had bragged about the bank's sales ability. She said he did so even as he knew about the cross-selling problems.
""She definitely did take some of my comments out of context, but I thought the hearing was very good,"" Sloan told CNBC in a brief interview in the hallway leaving the hearing room.
 Sloan said he didn't understand why the committee spent as much time as it did on his actions before he became CEO last October. ""The focus on the hearing was Wells Fargo, one year later, and I don't really understand why we spent as much time as we did talking about history,"" he said.
At the hearing, Warren said Sloan should be fired and argued he was part of a culture that pushed the bank to create millions of fake accounts for customers without their knowledge.
In prepared testimony, Sloan apologized for the creation of the accounts and said the bank has hired back more than 1,000 workers who were wrongly fired or left under a cloud.
In late August, Wells admitted that as many as 3.5 million accounts were created for customers without their permission. That's nearly 70 percent more than originally thought.
The scandal led to the departure of multiple executives, including former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf, Sloan's predecessor.

 Mylan move is a bit exaggerated after FDA drug approval: Analyst   
 6:46  PM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  02:29 
 Mylan shares surged on Wednesday after news about the approval of its generic drug for multiple sclerosis, but Wells Fargo Securities senior analyst David Maris told CNBC the move was ""a little bit exaggerated.""
 Mylan closed 16 percent higher after it announced the Food and Drug Administration approved its generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical's multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone.
Mylan said that shipping was imminent for its Glatiramer Acetate 40 mg/mL for 3-times-a-week injection and 20 mg/mL for once-daily injection.
 While it is a big win for Mylan, Maris told ""Power Lunch"" that ""simple math"" shows that investor reaction may be a little too enthusiastic.
He said that, optimistically, generic Copaxone 40 mg could contribute about $0.13 in earnings per share per quarter.
""However, it may be unrealistic to assume a quick share shift given the patient population and the nature of the disease. It will bear close watching whether the market converts to a new player, or like in the case of the 20 mg, Teva is able to maintain a good amount of share,"" Maris wrote in a research note earlier Wednesday.
However, he told CNBC he understands why people are excited.
""They've only had bad news in the generic industry recently, and now you have a little bright news here with a key win for Mylan,"" he said.
The FDA on Monday said it would introduce new measures to speed up bringing generic versions of complex drugs to the market. The moves came as the agency attempts to deal with the rising cost of drugs in the U.S.
However, Maris warned what FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb ""gives with one he can take away with another.""
""One thing to keep in mind is a complex generic like EpiPen, there's no AB rated, non-Mylan generic out there. That could be one of the things he targets next,"" he said.
— CNBC's AJ Vielma, Berkeley Lovelace and Reuters contributed to this report.

 Senator Elizabeth Warren had some harsh words for Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan   
 3:48  PM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  01:24 
 Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan appeared before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday a year after his predecessor was in the same hot seat. Sloan was elected CEO after his predecessor, John Stumpf, was ousted in the wake of the fake accounts scandal at Wells.
 Sloan is the wrong person to right the ship at Wells Fargo. That job requires a level of recognition, competence, and credibility that he lacks.
A leader will not be able to fix a problem without first recognizing how extensive and serious the problem is. Sloan is on record as saying of Wells Fargo, ""I don't think we need to fundamentally change the core culture but we need to massage it a fair amount.""
 That suggests a state of denial. It is as if the mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, in the wake of the recent devastation of Hurricane Maria there, said ""I don't think that we need to do a lot of rebuilding but some refurbishing may be in order.""
Fixing a serious problem also requires a high level of competence. Senator Elizabeth Warren directly questioned Sloan's competence at the Senate Banking Committee hearing Tuesday saying, ""At best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit.""
Sloan has worked at the bank for 29 years and was chief financial officer while millions of fake accounts were created and hundreds of thousands of auto loan customers were signed up for auto insurance that they did not request, approve or need.
Wells Fargo and Sloan have argued that Sloan was not supervising the consumer banking division that was the central locus of the fake accounts scandal at the time, and so was not responsible for what occurred there.
 ""Sloan is the wrong person to right the ship at Wells Fargo. That job requires a level of recognition, competence, and credibility that he lacks.""
 That defense would be more persuasive if the fraudulent accounts were the work of one or two rogue employees in one division of the bank. That isolated misbehavior might be hard to detect. But the misbehavior at Wells Fargo involved thousands of employees creating 3.5 million unauthorized accounts over a period of years.
It is one thing for a senior executive in a company to not recognize the wrongful but isolated behavior of one or two rogue employees. It is quite another thing for that leader to not notice the wrongful behavior of thousands of employees.
There are grounds for questioning the competence of a chief financial officer who fails to recognize thousands of employees engaged in financial misbehavior just as there are grounds for questioning the competence of a firefighter whose spidey sense is not activated when smoke enters a room.
Where there's smoke there is usually fire, and given the extent of wrongdoing at Wells and the number of employees involved, there had to have been a lot of smoke.
Sloan also lacks the credibility needed to lead Wells through an ethical turnaround. Appointing Sloan CEO after the fake accounts scandal repeats a mistake that BP made after the Deepwater Horizon tragedy.
As part of a program to rebuild trust in that company, incoming BP CEO Bob Dudley announced the creation of a new safety and occupational risk department. The new safety department was described as having sweeping powers to audit and oversee operations of BP around the world. Mark Bly was put in charge of the new safety division, to report directly to Dudley.
That all sounded good. But the problem is that Bly was head of safety during the time period leading up to the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig.
If BP wanted to send a message that it was transforming its safety culture, then it should have put an executive from the oil company with the best safety record in charge of the new global safety division, not the guy who was in charge of safety before the Gulf tragedy.
And if Wells Fargo wanted to send a strong and clear message to employees, investors, customers and lawmakers that it was transforming its culture, it should have appointed a new CEO from a bank with a stellar reputation for ethics and compliance.
As banking analyst Dick Bove observed when Tim Sloan was elected CEO at Wells:
""To take Tim Sloan, who was CFO in a good portion of that period, and say he's the salvation is totally incorrect…. They need to go outside the company. They need to steal somebody from JPMorgan.""
(Bove this week reversed his position, singing Sloan's praises, but I stand by his initial assessment.)
Senator Warren told Sloan at the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday that because he was either incompetent or complicit he should be fired. I hesitate to recommend that anyone be fired, but at a minimum Sloan should be reassigned to make room for someone who has what it takes to right the ship at Wells Fargo. Sloan does not.

 Sen. Heidi Heitkamp: Wells Fargo dodged upper management accountability   
 1:57  PM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  05:09 
 There should be changes to criminal law to require more responsibility from those at the top in order to prevent another scandal like that at Wells Fargo, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., told CNBC on Wednesday.
 ""Obviously people think that 'as long as I didn't know I'm not going to suffer the ultimate consequence,' which is white-collar crime,"" she said in an interview with ""Power Lunch.""
""If we can start developing a level of personal responsibility of corporate leadership with the ultimate penalty being a criminal prosecution, we'll see changes in terms of the duty to know.""
 Wells Fargo has admitted employees enrolled customers in programs without their knowledge in an effort to meet aggressive sales goals. About 3.5 million accounts were affected.
""I think somebody should go to jail,"" Heitkamp said.
When asked who that would be, she didn't name names, but said, ""The person who is the most culpable for making the decisions.""
In a follow-up email, Heitkamp's spokesperson said: ""The Head of Community Banking withheld information until way too late in the game and did not talk to senior leadership about the systemic failures in her division. Senator Heitkamp believes that in cases like this, there should be real criminal fines and penalties for the individual that did not report the problems.""
A Wells Fargo board investigation laid blame for the scandal on a high-pressure sales culture and former community banking head Carrie Tolstedt, who was accused of ignoring the systematic nature of the abusive sales practices.
Lawyers for Tolstedt rejected those findings, saying ""a full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion.""
Her attorney, Enu Mainigi, had no comment on Heitkamp's remarks.
 'Absolutely not' satisfied
 Heitkamp was among those who grilled Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan about the scandal during Tuesday's Senate Banking Committee hearing.
At the hearing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren demanded Sloan be fired, saying, ""at best you were incompetent, at worst you were complicit.""
Sloan said he believes the bank was making strides in restoring its reputation and promised more changes are on the way.
Heitkamp said whether or not Sloan should be fired is up to Wells Fargo, but said she was ""absolutely not"" satisfied with what she heard at Tuesday's hearing.
For one, Sloan said Wells Fargo wouldn't force arbitration on people who had false accounts set up, and then when questioned about a forced arbitration case in Utah, said he didn't know about it, she said.
""There's one of two things. Either he does know and he's not telling us or he's really woefully ill-prepared and he doesn't see the next scandal coming along,"" she said.
What Heitkamp wants to see is a change in corporate culture, where you don't hear executives saying they're not familiar about things having to do with the ""big, big problems that they have.""
""What we did here is 'we're really, really big and we represent a lot of people and just trust us.' And that boat left the shore a long time ago. There isn't going to be any more 'trust us.'""

Johnson & Johnson Listerine brand cool mint mouthwash bottles move through the production line on a conveyor at the J&J consumer healthcare products plant in Lititz, Pennsylvania.
 Johnson & Johnson's acquisition of biotech company Actelion will help to re-accelerate top-line growth, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Wells Fargo raised its rating on J&J on Monday, saying improved performance could lead to better-than-expected third-quarter results and gains in 2018.
""With the accretion from Actelion, more measured impact from biosimilar competition than expected, solid performance of key drugs and a pipeline that is coming to fruition, we believe that JNJ is poised to reaccelerate its top-line growth,"" analyst Larry Biegelsen wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""Our analysis of IMS data, Nielsen report and FX trend suggests potential upside in Q3 sales, although the near-term impact of the recent hurricanes makes it hard to handicap any EPS upside.""
 Biegelsen increased his total third-quarter sales estimate by $103 million to $19.39 billion, above Wall Street consensus of around $19.3 billion, according to the report. He also raised his price target on J&J to $149 from $140, representing 12 percent upside from Friday's close.
The stock is up more than 15 percent since January, outperforming the market. The company announced plans earlier this year to acquire Swiss biotech company Actelion in a $30 billion all-cash deal, providing J&J access to high-price, high-margin medicines for rare diseases. The deal closed in June.
The shares were up fractionally Monday. The drugmaker is set to report earnings on Oct. 17.
With several sources of upside, the analyst considers third-quarter 2017 as ""a turning point"" for J&J sales growth in 2018. In addition to the gains from Actelion, Biegelsen said the company could see further top-line success thanks to increased cost saving and greater foreign exchange tail winds in the next year.
""We could see the company overachieve its cost savings targets,"" he added. ""FX tailwind may be closer to 100 basis points, which would translate to additional sales of $500 million.""
The analyst estimates 2018 Johnson & Johnson total revenue of $80.33 billion and EPS of $7.76, ahead of the Wall Street consensus of $79.99 billion and $7.73, respectively.

A Wells Fargo ATM featuring the “Use an Access Code” button.
 Wells Fargo has upgraded more than 5,000 ATMs with new technology that allows customers to access their accounts -- and take out cash -- with a smartphone instead of a debit card.
 The move builds on an earlier one by Wells Fargo that allowed customers to access an ATM simply by generating a special code inside the Wells Fargo smartphone app.
The ATMs have a new near-field communications (NFC) module that allows customers to tap a phone configured with Apple Pay, Samsung Pay or Android Pay instead of swiping or inserting a debit card into the machine. Wells Fargo said that customers will still need to enter their PIN into the machine in order to take out money.
 The feature gives consumers more of a reason to leave their debit and credit cards at home. Most modern phones allow users to store credit and debit cards to make mobile payments without the need to present a debit or credit card. Wells Fargo now takes it one step further.
The company hopes to upgrade more than 13,000 additional ATMs with the feature by 2019.

 Wells Fargo shares fall after posting mixed Q3   
 9:01  AM ET Fri, 13 Oct 2017 |  01:00 
 Wells Fargo reported third quarter revenue that missed expectations Friday, sending shares lower. 
 The bank reported:
 Earnings per share of $1.04, ex-items, vs. the $1.03 a share expected by analysts polled by Reuters. Revenue of $21.93 billion, vs. $22.4 billion expected. 
 Revenue fell 2 percent from the same quarter last year. 
Shares fell more than 3 percent in trading Friday.
The adjusted earnings per share excludes 20 cents of charges related to litigation for a mortgage-related regulatory case from before the financial crisis, the bank said.
The litigation cost of $1 billion contributed to an operating loss of $1.3 billion in the third quarter and increased the efficiency ratio to a worse-than-expected 65.5 percent. The bank said in a May presentation that it expected a ratio of 60 to 61 percent for 2017. 
""I think the company is probably going to need a more robust expense savings program in order to get down to that target,"" said Kevin Barker, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray. He added that rising interest rates should have helped Wells Fargo lower its efficiency ratio.
A rising efficiency ratio indicates a bank's expenses are increasing or the company's revenues are declining. Overall noninterest expenses rose $14.4 billion, more than the $13.6 billion projected by FactSet.
Net interest income, a key measure of profitability, rose nearly $500 million from a year earlier to $12.48 billion, but missed expectations of $13.14 billion projected by FactSet.
""Over the past year we have made fundamental changes to transform Wells Fargo as part of our effort to rebuild trust and build a better bank,"" CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement. ""We saw total average deposit growth; loan growth in our residential mortgage, credit card and subscription finance portfolios; as well as higher assets under management in Wealth and Investment Management.""
Wells Fargo has struggled to recover from a massive consumer sales scandal last year that resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and the resignation of then-CEO John Stumpf. 
Sloan has since grappled with revelations of more fraudulent consumer accounts and a shakeup of board members. Asked Friday during a conference call with analysts whether the bank had reached the end of a months'-long analysis of what went wrong and how it could fix things, Sloan said the review is going to last a long time.
""We've said look we want to be the best in the industry,"" he said, admitting Wells isn't quite there yet. ""It's a mistake to put a stake in the ground and say everything's got to be done by a certain date because then what happens is people might rush to get to the answer. I don't want them to rush the answer.""
Wells Fargo shares are down 2.8 percent for the year. In contrast, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) has climbed 12 percent to highs not seen since 2007. 
Bank of America also reported earnings on Friday before the bell, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines.
Bank earnings season began Thursday with JPMorgan Chase reporting earnings well above Wall Street estimates but a big drop in trading revenue. Citigroup reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that beat expectations.

 Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan: Scandal hasn't impacted commercial business   
 2:51  PM ET Wed, 18 Oct 2017 |  02:29 
 Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan predicted Wednesday that the scandal-ridden bank will achieve the growth it had lost during its fake-accounts scandal.
 Sloan made the comments just days after Wells reported earnings Friday of $1.04 a share for the third quarter, slightly better than Wall Street estimates. However, revenue came up light and shares fell.
""We're turning over every rock in the company and we're making really good changes not only to fix anything that was broken but also in terms of investing and making a lot of changes in terms of new products and services,"" he told CNBC in a live interview. ""I'm very optimistic and confident that over time we'll achieve the growth that we've seen historically.""
 Sloan took over shortly after the bank paid a settlement with regulators over the bank's fake-account scandal. Employees enrolled customers into multiple programs without their knowledge in a practice that affected some 2.5 million accounts.
During a congressional hearing earlier this month, Sloan pledged that Wells ""is a better bank"" now than it was before the bogus cross-selling practices became public. However, Sen. Elizabeth Warren demanded that Sloan be fired.
Sloan said he was undeterred by the criticism.
""I've got a responsibility to 268,000 team members, over 72 million customers, that's who I focus on every day,"" he said. ""I think I'm the right person to be CEO because of my experience, because of my ability to make change ... and because of the optimism and resiliency that I have and because I have the support of our team.""
Despite his assurances that the bank has changed its culture, Sloan and Wells continue to come under withering criticism for conduct leading up to and since the scandal broke. Shares also have underperformed, falling nearly 3 percent in 2017 as part of a weak year for bank stocks overall.
Addressing one of the more specific complains about the bank's conduct, Sloan denied that the Wells hierarchy hid the cross-selling scandal from customers and regulators, despite memos indicating that officials were aware the Los Angeles Times had been talking to disgruntled customers.
""That wasn't elevated to senior leadership, including me, until late 2013,"" he said. ""We had an incentive plan in our retail bank that drove inappropriate behavior. Since I've become CEO we've dealt with that.""

Steven Eisman, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman
 Steve Eisman, a fund manager at Neuberger Berman, said Thursday at a conference he is betting Wells Fargo shares will go down, while Citigroup shares will rise.
 Wells Fargo shares have fallen far behind other financial stocks this year as the bank struggles to recover from a consumer sales scandal that broke last year. The stock has now fallen out of favor with a noted investor.
""The cultural issues I think at Wells Fargo went very, very deep,"" Eisman told CNBC in a phone interview. ""They have to unwind these cultural issues."" 
 Eisman expects earnings will be ""flattish"" over the next few years, and pointed to negative signs such as the bank's decline in loans in the third quarter. He said he generally doesn't give price targets. 
Wells Fargo declined to comment to CNBC.
On the other hand, ""Citi is the cheapest large bank,"" Eisman told CNBC. He said he expects plans to reduce regulation will improve Citi's return on equity to 14 or 15 percent from around 8 percent.
Citi also declined to comment.
Eisman famously bet against the housing market by shorting, or betting against, U.S. banks ahead of the financial crisis, which was depicted in the movie ""The Big Short."" In May, Eisman said on CNBC's ""Fast Money"" that he is now investing in ""a whole bunch of banks and investment banks"" and specifically mentioned Citigroup.
Eisman gave his presentation on the bank stocks Thursday at Capitalize for Kids, an investment conference in Toronto, Canada, whose proceeds go towards helping to solve challenges in children's brain and mental health. 
Wells Fargo shares are down nearly 3 percent for the year, among the worst performers in the S&P 500's financials sector. The bank paid $185 million in penalties after it was discovered Wells Fargo employees had opened about 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization since 2011. CEO Tim Sloan took over the company in October 2016 and the bank announced a board shakeup this past August. 
Last week, Wells Fargo reported a revenue miss in the third quarter. Shares rose 0.6 percent in midday Thursday trading.
In contrast, Citi reported better-than-expected earnings last week and shares are up nearly 22 percent this year as one of the best performers in the S&P financial sector. Shares recovered some of their losses to trade about 0.7 percent lower Thursday afternoon, amid a broad market decline. 
Financial stocks overall are up more than 12 percent this year.

59,2017-10-20,Regulator blasts Wells Fargo for deceptive auto insurance program  Wells Fargo reportedly fires foreign exchange execs amid investigations  ,"Jeremy M. Lange | The Washington Post | Getty Images
Samir Hanef sits in his car in Durham, North Carolina on August 11, 2017. Hanef's car was repossessed in December of 2016 by Wells Fargo Bank for non payment of car insurance even though he had never signed up for insurance through the bank.
 Wells Fargo engaged in unfair and deceptive practices, failed to properly manage risks and hasn't set aside enough money to pay back the customers it harmed, according to a confidential report by federal regulators.
The report, prepared by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and reviewed by The New York Times, criticizes Wells Fargo for forcing hundreds of thousands of borrowers to buy unneeded auto insurance when they took out a car loan, as well as its handling of the problems once they were detected.
The regulators' report, sent to the bank this week, is preliminary. Still, it represents the latest blow to the reputation of Wells Fargo, America's third-largest bank and one that was once regarded as being among the best run in the country. The bank is still trying to recover from a scandal in which its  employees created millions of credit card and bank accounts that customers had not requested, eventually leading to the ouster of the bank's chief executive and millions of dollars in regulatory fines.

The comptroller's findings could have a significant impact on the bank. The report stated that Wells Fargo had most likely underestimated how much it would cost to reimburse harmed customers. And it could force the bank to curb, or at least more closely monitor, its practices across the entire company.
Wells Fargo's improper auto insurance practices came to light in July, after  The Times obtained an internal report prepared for the bank's executives. That analysis showed that more than 800,000 people who took out car loans from  Wells Fargo were charged for  auto insurance they did not want or need, typically because they already had coverage.
That internal report said the costs of the unneeded insurance, which covered collision damage, had caused some 274,000 Wells Fargo customers to fall behind on their car loans, and almost 25,000 vehicles were wrongly repossessed. Customers on active military duty were among those hurt by the practice.
In the comptroller's report, regulators said management at the bank's auto loan unit, Wells Fargo Dealer Services, had ignored signs of problems in the business such as consumer complaints, focusing instead on sales volume and performance. The report described its management of compliance risk — essentially the ability to abide by regulations and best practices — as ""weak."" It noted that Wells Fargo in 2015 had characterized the risks associated with this business as ""low.""
Wells Fargo has set aside $80 million to compensate the 570,000 customers it said were harmed by receiving auto insurance they didn't want. The comptroller's office said that the amount was inadequate and that the bank might have to pay out substantially more as additional victims were identified — partly because Wells Fargo's analysis of how much money it needed to set aside excluded many years when the insurance was being imposed.
The report does give Wells Fargo's management credit for taking action after identifying the problems at the auto loan unit, such as hiring legal and consulting firms to assess customer harm, changing staff at the operation and notifying regulators.
The comptroller's findings are likely to affect how Wells Fargo does business, not just in the auto lending operation but across the bank. The comptroller's office said it would require Wells Fargo to ensure that all of its business units had effective systems in place to identify and prevent risky practices.
Catherine Pulley, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said in a statement that the bank had made significant changes in recent months to strengthen controls and oversight of insurers and outside vendors with which it does business.
""We are also working to enhance our customer care program and improve complaints resolution,"" she said. ""We will continue to work with regulators on the remediation and make improvements to our auto lending business to build a better Wells Fargo.""
Wells Fargo stopped the auto insurance program in September 2016.
Once the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency makes its findings formal, Wells Fargo will have time to correct the problems. A spokeswoman for the comptroller's office declined to comment on the report.
The report did not mention penalties or fines. The comptroller can impose penalties for violations of laws or unsound business practices in an attempt to deter violations and encourage corrective measures.
Last year, the comptroller's office came under scrutiny for its own failures to supervise Wells Fargo. A  report in April by the office's ombudsman concluded that the agency ""must continue our efforts to improve and refine the agency's supervisory program, to sharpen our early warning processes, and to enhance our supervisory capabilities.""
The comptroller's review of Wells Fargo's auto lending and insurance practices has been underway for several months.
The report paints a damning picture of a bank that didn't monitor its contractors, that lacked the impetus to correct problems once they were uncovered and that proved unresponsive to complaints from its customers.
For example, the comptroller cited extensive lapses in Wells Fargo's oversight of National General, an insurer with which it had contracted to underwrite the auto insurance. National General was not obligated to — and did not — alert Wells Fargo to customer complaints about the unneeded insurance, the report said.
And when auditors at Wells Fargo detected and then flagged problems with National General in 2015, the comptroller's office said, the bank didn't act on those concerns promptly.
Christine Worley, a spokeswoman for National General, disputed elements of the report. ""We believe that our customer service in this area was handled in a timely manner,"" she said in a statement. ""We work closely with our financial institution clients and advise them of complaints on a regular basis.""
The bank's lapses in handling consumer complaints and managing vendors are not new. Regulators in recent years had ordered Wells Fargo to improve its oversight in both areas.
Wells Fargo's ability to track consumer complaints efficiently, for example, had been part of a 2015 compliance-improvement plan at the bank, the report noted. And a so-called consent order in 2011 between Wells Fargo and the comptroller's office involving the bank's mortgage foreclosure operations required it to establish a more effective program to manage its relationships with outside companies and contractors.
The comptroller's office also concluded that the bank's plan to compensate customers who were harmed by the improprieties was insufficient. When calculating potential damages, the bank limited its payments to customers who were affected beginning in January 2012 and extending to July this year. But the auto insurance program has been in place for almost 12 years, and the bank didn't calculate potential damages caused for much of that period.
""The number of customers harmed in this time period could be substantial,"" the report said.
Wells Fargo also used ""an overly complicated reimbursement methodology which lacked clear support for addressing all the customer costs incurred,"" according to the report.
Wells Fargo's auto insurance practices violated a section of the Federal Trade Commission Act that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, the report said. For example, the bank did not break out the insurance costs embedded in car loans; rather, it included the amounts owed on the unneeded coverage in the monthly payments. Had borrowers known what the cost increases were for, the comptroller's office said, they could have taken action more quickly to avoid harm.
Even when Wells Fargo borrowers notified National General that they already had car insurance, they had trouble reversing the erroneous charges. The comptroller office's review of loan files and consumer complaints showed that Wells Fargo's customers often had to submit proof of coverage multiple times before the coverage was canceled.

A protester outside a Wells Fargo branch in New York City.
 Wells Fargo fired four foreign-exchange executives amid an investigation into that business both internally and from regulators, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing sources familiar with the matter.
 Wells Fargo confirmed the departures to the Journal and CNBC. 
Shares of Wells Fargo remained about 2 percent higher Friday afternoon. 
 The executive firings and investigation into the investment-banking division would add to Wells Fargo's existing struggle with scandal in its consumer banking business.
The bank paid $185 million in penalties after it was revealed last year that employees opened millions of unauthorized consumer deposit and credit card accounts for years in order to meet aggressive sales goals, a practice the bank said it has since ended. In August, the bank said an expanded third-party review identified about 3.5 million such accounts and that Wells Fargo has now paid millions in total customer refunds or payments.
The bank appointed a new CEO, Tim Sloan, last October, and announced a reorganization of its board this summer.
In late July, news broke that hundreds of thousands of Wells Fargo customers were charged for auto insurance they did not need. 
This week, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency sent a confidential preliminary report to Wells Fargo that criticized the bank for the auto insurance sales practices and how it handled the problem, The New York Times reported Friday.
The OCC report also said Wells Fargo may need to refund customers more than the $80 million the bank has set aside for payouts, the Times said. A person familiar with the matter told the Journal the same thing. 
The OCC declined to comment to the Times and did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.
Wells Fargo told the Journal that the bank has discontinued the auto insurance-related product. ""We will continue to work with regulators on the remediation and will make improvements to our auto lending business,"" a bank spokeswoman told the Journal.
Noted investor Steve Eisman said Thursday he is betting against Wells Fargo shares due to deep ""cultural issues"" that will take time to unwind. Eisman bet against the housing market ahead of the financial crisis, which was depicted in the movie ""The Big Short.""
About 0.6 percent of Wells Fargo shares available for trading are sold short, or in anticipation of a decline, according to FactSet.
Wells Fargo was once considered one of the most upstanding banks in the U.S. The stock is little changed for this year in contrast to the S&P 500 financial stocks' 14 percent gain.

 Leon Cooperman: My largest position is Google   
 3:19  PM ET Tue, 24 Oct 2017 |  02:15 
 Leon Cooperman, chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors, shared his top stock ideas Tuesday on CNBC's ""Halftime Report."" 
 ""I'm finding a lot of stocks that are attractively priced,"" said the hedge fund manager. ""My largest position is Google [meaning Alphabet shares, the company that owns Google].""
Cooperman said Alphabet trades at 19 times next year's earnings and is able to grow its sales at 20 percent per year. He likes how it has a ""fortress balance sheet."" 
 He revealed he owns other growth technology stocks such as Facebook and Amazon. 
""Amazon is changing the whole landscape of retailing,"" Cooperman said.
The investor is bullish on financial stocks as he predicts rates will rise, boosting the sector's earnings prospects.
""We own some Wells Fargo. We own some Citi,"" he said. ""Interest rates are below where they ought to be. I expect interest rates to rise.""
Cooperman also forecasts oil prices will increase to $60 per barrel.
""We own Hess. We own Parsley Energy ... WPX Energy,"" he said. ""The world economy is not going to grow 3 percent to 3.5 percent without the demand for energy growing.""
Cooperman founded Omega Advisors in 1991. The firm has approximately $3.7 billion in assets under management, according to its website.
His firm agreed in May to a $4.9 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission after allegations of insider trading. As part of the settlement, Omega Advisors admitted to no wrongdoing.

67,2017-11-03,"Bear market in oil may last another decade, with US crude stuck between $30 and $60 a barrel, Wells Fargo says  ","Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images
A Nabors Industries floor hand uses a towel to wipe drilling fluid from a section of pipe on a crude oil rig outside New Town, N.D.
 Bears are known for hibernating, but its the bulls in the oil market that might as well settle in for a long nap, according to Wells Fargo.
 The bank expects the current bear market for oil to last another five to 10 years, Wells Fargo Investment Institute analyst Austin Pickle wrote in a new research note. During that time, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude prices are likely to remain stuck between $30 and $60 a barrel.
If that call is correct, it means there's little upside for WTI, which came just 2 cents shy of its 2017 high of $55.24 on Wednesday.
 U.S. crude 40-day performance
 Supercycle bear markets typically last 20 years, but this one may not run that long, according to Pickle. These prolonged slumps have been shortening over the course of the last century. The last commodity bear supercycle lasted about 16 years from 1983 to 1999. 
""Why do bear markets last so long? After the excesses of the bull market, and the wake-up call of a spike in bust rate, the companies that remain cut costs anywhere they can, prioritize investments, and become more efficient,"" Pickle wrote.
""Money is no longer being thrown at every imaginable oil play, and only the most cost-effective oil producers remain. As a result, the remaining companies survive low oil prices for longer,"" he said.
The current cycle, sparked by a ""flash flood of production"" as U.S. drillers learned to extract oil and gas from shale rock formations, sent prices spiraling to $26 a barrel in February 2016 from more than $100 a barrel in the summer of 2014.
""Bear markets in commodities are a consequence of human behavior in the preceding bull market. Higher prices invite investment in new technology (such as shale oil extraction) — and then production, production and more production — until, eventually, supply overwhelms demand,"" Pickle said.
 The bear market has already gone through the first step of the healing process: weeding out the weakest players. Roughly 22 percent of exploration and production companies went bust during this phase, compared with about 26 percent in the 1986 oil price crash, according to Wells Fargo.
But the second step of the process — crude stuck within a certain range of prices — typically drags on for years, Pickle warned. It lasted more than 12 years from the '86 crash to the start of the new bull market in 1999 during the previous bear supercycle. So far, the current downturn is following the same price trend.
The last step is exasperation, when companies and investors, exasperated by years of little to no profits, throw in the towel. Drillers shut down and investors look for other opportunities. As investment in the industry dwindles, demand for the commodity overtakes supply, and a new bull market is born.

 Wells Fargo strategist reveals what worries him about the rally   
 2:02  PM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  02:28 
 With just about seven weeks left until the end of the year, Wells Fargo Securities has just raised its year-end S&P 500 target to reflect what its top equity strategist calls a quantitative easing-type phenomenon gripping stocks.
Christopher Harvey, the firm's head of equity strategy, is seeing the rising popularity of index funds and ETFs changing the dynamics of the bull market. He contends these passive investing instruments have been creating upward pressure on stock prices, and that's been a major reason why stocks have rallied so sharply in 2017.
 ""It's very similar to QE."" Harvey said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""With QE, you took a certain part of the Treasury market out of circulation. Now what you're doing is you're taking a good part of the equity market out of circulation, and you're upsetting the supply and demand dynamics. There are fewer natural sellers.""
Wells Fargo's new 2017 forecast calls for the S&P 500 to reach 2,636, which reflects about a 1.9 percent gain from current levels. The firm started the year with a 2,475 year-end target, which would have come in about 4 percent short if the year was to end now.
""We don't see a lot of bad news in the short term, and so we feel it's fairly justified,"" said Harvey, who became in charge of the firm's S&P 500 price target and earnings forecast in April. He acknowledges Wells Fargo's initial forecast was ""too conservative"" and the year has been exceeding expectations.
According to Harvey, there's still momentum in place for stocks to grind higher.
""No one wants to be the first one out of the pool. No one wants to de-risk at this point in time,"" Harvey added. ""You have this mindset of FOMO — fear of missing out.""
But that's Harvey's short-term forecast, and it shouldn't be confused with 2018. He's making it clear that investors will see fewer milestones as the markets get more expensive and risks grow.
""Inertia is becoming the most powerful force in the capital markets. A body of motion tends to stay in motion. And, that for us is a big concern. We want to see people more paranoid,"" Harvey said. ""As the market goes higher, everyone is becoming more bullish. I think all the positives are starting to color people's beliefs and views. They're not looking at risk in the proper way.""

 Coca-Cola shares are set for a breakout thanks to successes overseas and its mission to expand its beverage lineup, according to Wells Fargo, which upgraded the stock to outperform.
 But probably most interesting in analyst Bonnie Herzog's note was speculation that the 125-year-old purveyor of sugary beverages may make a move into alcoholic beverages. She expects management to make some hints of this at the company's investor day on Thursday.
""We expect management will highlight a lot of this innovation,"" Herzog wrote on Monday, as well as ""expand on CEO [James] Quincey's recent commentary to: grow and incubate high-growth brands in the U.S. through its Venturing & Emerging Brands unit (VEB); build and nurture small brands internationally, similar to what it has achieved with success in the U.S. with VEB and through local partnerships; expand into other premium segments such as adult craft beverages.""
 Wells Fargo raised its 12-month price target on the company to $51 from $45, representing 9 percent upside from Monday's close.
A Coca-Cola spokesperson told CNBC that questions on beverage expansion will not be addressed until investor day.
The soft drink giant bought Fuze and Vitamin Water in 2007, Honest Tea in 2011 and Keurig Green Mountain in 2014. Coca-Cola that year also took a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage, a popular energy drink maker. But since then, Coke's acquisition game-plan seems to have stalled.
In her list of key questions for management on investor day, Herzog writes, ""To what extent does KO intend to expand into adult craft beverages, and will that include alcoholic beverages (or just mixers)?""
Coca-Cola is the world's largest non-alcoholic beverage maker with a market value of $199.6 billion. AB InBev is the world's largest maker of alcoholic beverages with a market value of $197.2 billion. The maker of Budweiser just replaced its North America president in an effort to revive slumping beer sales.
Herzog also said Coca-Cola's stake in Monster is a potential area for excitement, noting that the press has been quick to jump on any signs of a potential deal.
""We continue to believe Coca-Cola's best-in-class distribution and strong brand portfolio will allow it to retain its premium valuation and believe that investments in productivity and marketing today will pay off in years to come,"" added Herzog. ""We think Coca-Cola can support roughly 5 to 6 percent organic revenue growth over the next several years, ahead of current consensus estimates.""
During the company's upcoming investor day, the analyst also expects the business to highlight diminished headwinds in Venezuela and Brazil, and cost savings in North America.
""With a new reinvigorated management team, and renewed focus on accelerating top-line growth while maintaining discipline around costs, we believe Coca-Cola's next chapter of growth is around the corner.""

 Wells Fargo's Aaron Rakers began coverage on Apple shares with a market perform rating, saying the smart phone maker's immediate prospects are more uncertain after its recent iPhone product launches. Rakers joined the firm last month as its new IT hardware and networking equipment analyst.
The company's iPhone 8 and iPhone X were released on Sept. 22 and Nov. 3 respectively.
 ""We believe strength in shares of Apple have, in part, been driven by a 'chase-the-performance' trade ahead of the iPhone 8/X product cycle,"" wrote Rakers, whose LinkedIn profile shows he previously worked at Stifel Nicolaus, in the Tuesday note. ""We think the shares could now see increased volatility, with a focus on incremental derivative demand and mix data points over the coming months.""
Apple shares fell 1.2 percent in early trading Wednesday after the report. Its shares are up 48 percent year to date through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 15 percent gain.
The analyst noted the risk of higher memory chip prices, which are essential components for the company's computing and smartphone products.
""Given the tight memory supply/demand dynamics, Apple's results could be negatively affected by lack of supply or higher-than-expected prices,"" he wrote.
Rakers started his price target for Apple shares at $195, representing 14 percent upside from Tuesday's close.
""While we applaud Apple's execution and continual ecosystem buildout, the inevitable shift to what's next should once again surface post the iPhone 8/X cycle,"" he wrote. ""We expect some investors to continually question Apple's rate of innovation (focus on Apple's significant R&D investments) for the iPhone as competitors offer similar features and cheaper smartphones.""
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

75,2017-11-17,Wells Fargo ousts consumer lending head over communication that was 'contrary' to company policy  Comcast in talks with 21st Century Fox: Sources  ,"Rick Wilking | Reuters
A customer leaves an ATM at a Wells Fargo branch in Denver.
 Wells Fargo's head of consumer lending was fired this week over a communication he had with another former executive about that person's firing.
 The San Francisco-based bank said Friday that Franklin Codel, a senior executive vice president who had been promoted to the position as head of Consumer Lending only last year, was dismissed, effective immediately. The dismissal, the bank said, was because Codel acted ""in a manner that was contrary to the company's policies and expectations of its senior leaders.""
The bank wouldn't get more specific about the nature of the communication. Reached by phone Codel would only say, ""I'm proud of my career at Wells Fargo.""
 Codel oversaw 45,000 workers in home lending, auto dealer services, personal lending and personal insurance. Wells Fargo is the nation's biggest mortgage lender and servicer. The executive, based in Iowa, joined Wells in 1993 and was head of home lending from 2015 to 2016, when he was promoted to head consumer lending in a big management shuffle.
Wells is still reeling from the fallout of a fake account scandal that cost its former CEO and other executives their jobs after it was discovered workers had created millions of accounts without customer approval or knowledge in order to achieve internal sales goals.
Wells said Friday the dismissal didn't involve the business or operations of the consumer lending operations and was not related to sales practices. It said a permanent successor will be named by the end of the year.
""Difficult as this situation is, the decision reflects our commitment to our values and culture and to executive accountability,"" said Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo's president and CEO. ""We have a strong team in Consumer Lending and I am fully confident that the transition will be smooth and that its businesses will continue to operate normally in serving our customers.""

 Fmr. Wells Fargo CEO on taxes and the impact on home buyers   
 2:27  PM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 |  02:29 
 There may be concerns about the impact of the Republican tax reform bill on the housing market, but former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich told CNBC on Tuesday that it is mainly the rich who will feel the pain.
 The House GOP plan halves the deduction of mortgage debt for newly purchased homes to $500,000, while the Senate bill leaves it intact at $1 million. However, the Senate proposal calls for the elimination of state and local tax deductions. The House bill limits those deductions.
Kovacevich told ""Power Lunch"" the changes may slow down the real estate market for a short time. However, he doesn't believe it will cause long-term harm to the housing market.
 ""There is no tax advantage to own a home in the United Kingdom or Canada,"" he said, noting their homeownership is at the same level or higher than the U.S.
""The people who really get hurt are the people who can afford it.""
Plus, the proposals double the standard deduction, so more people won't be taking the itemized deductions anyway, he said.
""You can't have tax reform unless you get rid of some of the incentives,"" he said. ""It has to start somewhere.""

 Wells Fargo bankers overcharged clients for higher bonuses   
 8:40  AM ET Tue, 28 Nov 2017 |  00:48 
 Evidence that embattled bank Wells Fargo had swindled some of its clients emerged in a June conference call led by its managers, according to two employees who were present during the call, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.
 The revelation, based on an internal assessment, reportedly came following years of rumors within the bank. Of the approximately 300 fee agreements for foreign exchange trades reviewed internally by Wells Fargo, only about 35 firms were billed the price they had been quoted, the employees told the Journal.
Wells Fargo charged one of the highest trading fees — at least two to eight times higher than industry standards, according to the bank's employees and others in the sector, the Journal reported.
 The latest case shares important similarities to Wells Fargo's ongoing sales scandal: Under a highly unusual policy, employees' bonuses were tied to how much revenue they brought in, the report said. 
The practice reportedly led retail employees to open as many as 3.5 million fake accounts, in a controversy first brought to light last year.

Attendees at Amazon.com annual cloud computing conference walk past the Amazon Web Services logo in Las Vegas, November 30, 2017.
 One Wall Street analyst is getting more bullish on Amazon's cloud computing business.
 Wells Fargo reiterated its overweight rating and increased its price target on Amazon shares to $1,525 from $1,430, representing 30 percent upside to Thursday's close. It is the highest target out of the 41 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet.
Amazon held its annual cloud computing AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas this week.
 ""We are increasing our Amazon price target … on higher outer-year AWS [Amazon Web Services] estimates and a higher SOTP [sum of the parts] value,"" analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note to clients Friday. There were ""numerous announcements at this week's AWS re:Invent Conference, particularly around AI / ML where AWS appears to be strengthening their position within the market.""
Amazon shares have rallied 57 percent this year through Thursday, compared with the market's 18 percent gain. Sena said Amazon's newly announced SageMaker product is a ""game-changer"" for the machine learning [ML] and the artificial intelligence market.
""SageMaker allows one to build, train, validate, and deploy different models with incredible ease,"" he wrote. It ""solves one of the biggest human demands in ML.""
As a result, the analyst raised his 2019 sales estimate for Amazon Web Services by 3 percent to $31.3 billion.
Amazon stock declined 0.6 percent shortly after Friday's market open.
Sena's price forecast increase comes after multiple other Amazon analysts raised their price targets in the previous two days.

Customers wait in line for an ATM outside of a Wells Fargo bank branch in Los Angeles.
 California's insurance regulator wants to suspend or take away Wells Fargo's insurance license for sales practices related to the bank's online referral program that it says were improper.
 About 1,500 unauthorized policies were opened on behalf of customers, many without their knowing, through the program, according to California, which filed the accusation against Wells Fargo last week. 
The sales concerned renter's insurance policies and term life policies offered by four different insurers through a referral program Wells offered in its branches.
 In a statement on Wednesday, Wells Fargo said, ""As we previously announced, Wells Fargo suspended online referrals of renters and simplified term life insurance products in December 2016 and initiated an internal review of those products. We have been cooperating with the CA Department of Insurance (DOI) over the course of this year.""
Last month, Wells said it would get out of the property and casualty personal insurance business but said the move was unrelated to the insurance department's investigation.
The bank has been trying to recover from a much broader fake accounts scandal that prompted a top management upheaval last year. Wells, based in San Francisco, paid $185 million in fines to federal regulators and the city of Los Angeles over the fake accounts problem uncovered last year that affected 3.5 million customers.
Bank employees, under pressure to meet aggressive sales targets, were opening unwanted deposit or credit card accounts in customers' names or enrolling them in services they didn't request. The scrutiny has since spread to mortgage and auto lending businesses at the bank.
The insurance sales through the referral program were mentioned in a footnote to a report about the bigger fake accounts scandal released by Wells' board of directors in April.
California's insurance regulator said in the accusations filed with the department last week that the unauthorized sales occurred between 2008 and 2016.
Wells said in its statement on Wednesday, ""We are sorry for any harm this caused our customers and we are making things right for them as part of an ongoing remediation.""
Shares of Wells Fargo were little changed on Wednesday.

 11:49  AM ET Fri,  8 Dec 2017 |  01:01 
 President Donald Trump rejected the notion Friday that Wells Fargo would skate on penalties associated with claims of mortgage lending abuse.
 Reports circulated earlier this week that Mick Mulvaney, interim head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was reviewing prior settlements the agency had made in enforcement actions.
Among them was a payout in the tens of millions of dollars regarding a practice in which Wells Fargo was charging borrowers fees to secure low mortgage rates. The practice reportedly affected more than 100,000 borrowers, and the bank has conceded that a ""substantial number"" of those customers were charged inappropriately.
 But Trump asserted in a tweet that the CFPB will not be letting Wells Fargo off the hook and said the penalties actually could increase.
 Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped
 The development comes as Mulvaney has promised substantial changes at the bureau, which he once called a ""joke."" He has vowed to examine open cases under his predecessor, Richard Cordray, who resigned last month.
For its part, Wells Fargo has pledge to reimburse customers for any wrongful charges. The bank did not respond to a request for comment on Trump's tweet.

 The total market capitalization of all digital currencies has surpassed $500 billion dollars for the first time.
 As both Ethereum and Litecoin soared to new record highs Tuesday, the combined market value of cryptocurrencies hit an all-time high of $506 billion at about 7:40 a.m. ET Wednesday, according to Coinmarketcap data.
That figure is worked out by multiplying the prices of cryptocurrencies by the total volume of those digital tokens in circulation.
 The market has seen unprecedented interest from investors as of late, and is now worth more than the market cap of billionaire Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway, which is currently valued at around $491 billion. The figure is also higher than the combined value of U.S. banks Citigroup and Wells Fargo, which are currently worth $201 billion and $297 billion respectively.

 The Fed cited the banker's ""family's prior sale of their interest in a bank to Wells Fargo.""
Wells Fargo acquired Salt Lake City-based First Security Corp. in 2000 in a deal worth about $3 billion in stock. The deal provided Quarles's wife's family with a significant stake in the bank. 
 In a statement, the Fed said that the action is voluntary and not legally required.

 Fifth Third Bank to give bonuses, raise minimum wage after tax bill passage   
 6:21  PM ET Wed, 20 Dec 2017 |  00:38 
 Fifth Third Bancorp will pay more than 13,500 employees a bonus and raise the minimum wage of its workforce to $15 an hour after the passage of the Republican tax plan that will cut the bank's corporate tax rate.
 Fifth Third is yet another company to announce a bonus for employees because of the tax plan. AT&T said earlier Wednesday that it would pay more than 200,000 U.S. employees $1,000 each and increase its capital spending budget by $1 billion.
Wells Fargo, meanwhile, also said it would be boosting its minimum wage for employees to $15 an hour, which was prompted by the tax plan. The San Francisco-based bank also said it would target $400 million in donations to community and nonprofit organizations next year.
 Cincinnati-based Fifth Third, the fifteenth largest U.S. bank by asset size, said the tax cut allowed it to re-evaluate its employee pay and pass along some of the windfall. Nearly 3,000 workers will see hourly wages rise to $15. The $1,000 one-time bonus is expected to be paid by the end of this year, the bank said, assuming President Donald Trump signs the bill into law by Christmas. 
Senior managers and top executives are excluded from the special payments. ""It is good for our communities, employees and Fifth Third Bank,"" said CEO Greg Carmichael in a statement.

 Analyst is 'cautious' on Apple iPhone sales due to mixed China data   
 11:15  AM ET Thu, 28 Dec 2017 |  00:38 
 The market's anticipation of strong sales from the new iPhones drove Apple shares much higher this year, but now one Wall Street firm says optimism for big upside is not warranted.
 Wells Fargo Securities reiterated its market perform rating on the tech giant's stock, saying the latest China export data point to meager iPhone sales growth in the December quarter.
""An analysis of China Province-level mobile phone export data this week reinforces our cautious opinion on Apple's iPhone cycle,"" analyst Aaron Rakers wrote in a note to clients Wednesday entitled ""iPhone-Related China Data Analysis: Implying Limited / No Yr/Yr Growth Thus Far In 4Q17.""
 Rakers wrote that his firm currently sees ""limited/no upside potential to our 81.2M iPhone ship estimate.""
Apple is one of the market's best-performing large-cap stocks of 2017, rallying 47 percent year to date through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's 20 percent gain.
The analyst noted the combined October and November phone exports in key iPhone-related Chinese provinces of Henan, Shanghai, Shanxi and Jiangsu were up only 0.6 percent year over year. He also said November phone exports out of Zhengzhou Customs, the largest port for iPhone shipments, were up 17 percent year over year in dollars, but down 8 percent year over year in units.
Rakers reaffirmed his $195 price target for Apple shares, which is 14 percent higher than Wednesday's closing price.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Dick's Sporting Goods could be a 'survivor' like Best Buy: Wells Fargo   
 2:13  PM ET Wed,  3 Jan 2018 |  00:41 
 The sporting goods sector in retail isn't shaping up to be all doom and gloom in 2018, despite some nasty headlines last year.
 Wells Fargo on Wednesday upgraded Dick's Sporting Goods to outperform, also raising the firm's price target on shares to $35 apiece, up from $26. The stock closed Tuesday at $29.49, having fallen about 43 percent over the past 12 months.
Wednesday morning, though, shares of Dick's Sporting Goods were up more than 5 percent.
 Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow wrote in a note to clients that the outlook for the sporting goods retailer is only ""improving"" from here, as industry trends from a higher level appear to be ""stabilizing"" after a rough few months. And that would be a good thing for Dick's Sporting Goods, the largest retailer in the space, Boruchow explained.
""With the consolidation occurring in the sporting goods industry (note recent bankruptcies of Sports Authority, Gander Mountain, etc.), DKS can continue to gobble up market share from struggling brick-and-mortar competitors and be the 'survivor' of the industry's consolidation (bringing to mind Best Buy in the electronics space),"" he added.
It's true that, similar to how the consumer electronics space has slimmed down in recent years (with names such as RadioShack and Circuit City going bankrupt), retailers that sell athletic apparel and accessories are now being forced to rethink their strategies, as more brands (such as Nike) opt to sell directly to consumers, bypassing third-party retailers completely.
That's exactly why retailers including Finish Line, Hibbett Sports and Foot Locker were hit so hard in 2017, with Wall Street questioning their ability to survive as brands pull back.
There's also the threat of Amazon, which is quietly rolling out more of its own athletic apparel lines and is trying to become more of an online destination for such goods.
Dick's Sporting Goods CEO Edward Stack went as far as saying his sector was in ""panic mode"" toward the end of 2017. ""We are intentionally joining the [retail] battle, and we will aggressively be promoting our business to drive market share to our stores and online,"" Stack told analysts and investors at the time.
Nonetheless, Boruchow, along with a handful of other analysts, is confident Dick's Sporting Goods could be the so-called last man standing, especially as some of the company's longer-term investments take hold. This includes investments in e-commerce and the private-label business, management said on a recent conference call.
""We continue to think that DKS will prove to be one of the few retailers to emerge from the digital disintermediation superstorm currently roiling the athletic retail sector, but that 'future DKS' will likely have a lower margin profile and earnings base as the company competes in a much more price transparent world with much higher expectations around consumer experience,"" Evercore ISI analyst Omar Saad wrote in November.
""Management is clearly pulling all the levers it deems necessary to secure the long-term viability of the Dick's Sporting Goods franchise,"" Saad added.

The entrance to a T.J. Maxx store in Miami, Florida.
 Retail's darling could be in trouble in the new year.
 As shoppers have flocked to off-price stores like TJ Maxx and Marshalls for a less-expensive, one-stop shopping fix, sales mushroomed and put added pressure on America's department stores.
For much of 2017, Wall Street cheered the unique ""treasure hunt"" experience these stores provide, saying the model is largely ""Amazon proof"" and difficult to replicate online.
 That said, soaring sales in the sector may be slowing, according to Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow. In a Wednesday note to clients he wrote that TJX (owner of TJ Maxx, HomeGoods and Marshalls), Ross Stores and Burlington could see lower sales in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2018.
Wells Fargo downgraded shares of TJX to market perform and cut its price target to $72 from $76. The stock closed Tuesday at $76.69, having climbed a little more than 7 percent over the past six months. TJX shares were falling around 2 percent late Wednesday morning.
Wells Fargo's price targets for Ross and Burlington were left unchanged, but both stocks were also trading modestly lower Wednesday.
Boruchow explained that talks with other brands are fueling his expectations that there could be a slowdown in the off-price sector's momentum in the coming months.
""The issue for TJX, relative to ROST and BURL, is size (they are multiples larger and carry many more brands),"" he wrote. However, the ""off-price setup from here could become 'less good' relative to the past 2 years.""
Other industry consultants have chimed in, saying it's true these companies could be bracing for some deceleration.
""I do think [off-price retailers] lose a little steam as they will generally have some of the most difficult comparisons going of any retail segment in 2018,"" Retail Metrics founder Ken Perkins told CNBC.
Then, some shoppers might ""trade up"" to new stores as the economy improves, he added, but the impact there should only be ""marginal.""
Others are still cheering on the stocks, though, and think TJX in particular could continue to gain market share as department stores shutter lcoations. Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen is calling the company his ""best idea for 2018,"" based on the fact that customers still appreciate TJX's ""deep value.""
""As most of traditional retail contracts their store bases and right-sizes their organizations to better fit the new normal of lower revenue bases, TJX sees significant white space ahead in terms of store growth,"" Chen wrote.
Growing at such a rapid clip (and recently launching a new brand, Homesense) could be a smart move for TJX, where others are cutting back, but some remain wary the expansion could come back to haunt the company.

Wells Fargo
 After working through the lingering effects of a fake account scandal, Wells Fargo will thrive in the coming years, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Bernstein raised its rating for the bank's shares to outperform from market perform, predicting a big boost to Wells Fargo's earnings from tax reform. The bank could have a $2.5 billion gain in the fourth quarter 2017 because of adjustments for the tax cuts, partially offset by taxes on profits returned from overseas, Bernstein noted. Earnings per share could get a 15 percent boost, the firm said.
Wells Fargo suffered from multiple sales-related scandals in its consumer operations in recent years, including the discovery that millions of customers were enrolled in programs without their consent or knowledge by employees trying to meet aggressive sales goals.
 ""We believe Wells Fargo is gradually moving past its sales practices issues and associated revenue deceleration, and has opportunities to improve its returns and earnings trajectory through a combination of increased capital distributions and expense savings,"" analyst John McDonald wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ""We believe Wells Fargo will be a meaningful beneficiary of tax reform.""
Wells Fargo underperformed the market in 2017. Its shares rose 10 percent while the S&P 500 gained 19 percent. The bank's stock rose nearly 1 percent Wednesday.
McDonald raised his price target for Wells Fargo shares to $69 from $64. The new target is 13 percent higher than Tuesday's closing price.
Better expense controls should be a boost to the shares in the next couple of years, the analyst said. ""A meaningful step up in capital returns in 2018/2019 and expense savings realization in 2019/2020 can provide a lift"" to future EPS, he wrote.

 Preparing for big banks' Friday earnings reports   
 7:26  PM ET Thu, 11 Jan 2018 |  01:16 
 Friday marks the unofficial start of earnings season, with big banks J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial reporting their quarterly numbers.
 But CNBC's Jim Cramer knows the fourth quarter tends to be ""messier"" for financial companies, so he wanted to make sure investors were prepared for the big day.
""I'm not trying to predict which banks will do well and which ones won't,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""I simply want to help separate the signal from the noise so that you'll be in a position to understand what's actually happening as it happens.""
 Top concerns
 First, Cramer assessed the impact of the newly passed tax code. When it became clear in December that the bill would pass, major lenders like Citigroup started to incur one-time, multi-billion-dollar charges in order to offset future taxes.
""Big companies like the financials have tons of unrecognized losses at any given time,"" Cramer explained. ""Those losses were much more valuable in 2017, offsetting a 35 percent tax rate, than they will be this year, when they only offset a 21 percent tax rate.""
So, to take full advantage of the new tax code, banks decided to take write-offs in the fourth quarter despite their adverse effects on the earnings reports.
J.P. Morgan, for one, risks reporting a 35 percent drop in its year-over-year net income, Reuters reported.
""Put it all together and that means the earnings for the fourth quarter could look horrendous on the surface,"" Cramer said. ""People will be [selling] the moment that it happens. I'm trying to steel you from that.""
Second, Cramer predicted that trading volumes would be down dramatically year over year, in part because of the trading bonanza that followed Donald Trump's election in late 2016.
""That's pretty suboptimal, but you have to understand that the banks are coming up against some very difficult comparisons here,"" he said.
 Key metrics
 Next, Cramer laid out the most important ways for investors to evaluate the bank's individual performance, starting with the net interest margin.
The No. 1 key metric for the industry, net interest margin is the difference between what banks pay individuals for their deposits and what they charge individuals for loans.
""It's still the primary way that banks make their money,"" Cramer said. ""Given that we got three rate hikes last year and the last quarter the net interest margins were pretty impressive, there's some real reason for optimism here and I think it could prevail.""
If net interest margins go up this quarter, the regional banks — which are purer plays on lending than the larger institutions — would benefit the most, Cramer said.
The second-most important metric for the banks is loan growth, also a key indicator for the health of the broader economy.
Strong loan growth means good things for the banks and for business confidence, as companies become more willing to borrow based on improved prospects.
But Cramer was most excited to hear about the big banks' plans for their dividend and share buyback programs. Lower tax rates and a less strict regulatory environment have created a more favorable environment for returning capital to shareholders, he said.
And with a former investment banker about to become the new Federal Reserve chairman, Cramer expected the banks to feel encouraged, if not eager, to reward their investors.
""They are sitting on boatloads of cash, so let's see how much they can increase their buybacks or signal large dividend boosts without risking the ire of the Fed,"" he said.
 Final thoughts
 As always, Cramer said the most valuable information will come from the banks' conference calls, because managements undeniably understand their businesses better than anybody else.
""Here's the bottom line: when the banks start reporting tomorrow, please don't be thrown off by all the one-time charges from the fourth quarter — they will be humongous — but do listen to everything they have to say about net interest margins, about loan growth and their plans to send money back to you,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The banks are the key leadership group in this market, and after our recent run, I don't think stocks can handle any real bank bad news. But I'm banking on the idea that we won't get much anyway.""

 Wells Fargo posts mixed fourth quarter results, effective 2018 tax rate 19 percent   
 8:31  AM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  01:37 
 Wells Fargo reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates but fell just short on revenue. Profit received a boost from the tax bill, putting the bank in a unique position among its Wall Street peers.
 The third-largest bank by assets said it earned $1.16 a share, or $6.2 billion, on revenue of $22.05 billion. The bank was expected to report fourth-quarter earnings of $1.07 per share on revenue of $22.38 billion, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
""While we faced challenges in 2017, we are a much better company today than we were a year ago, and I am confident that this year Wells Fargo will be even better,"" CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement.
 The profit represents a 17 percent increase from the same period in 2016.
Shares, however, were down nearly 1 percent in electronic trading shortly after the earnings release, off the morning lows.
""There is nothing in this report that suggests the stock should be bought,"" said Vertical Group analyst Dick Bove. ""However this report reflects history not the numerous positive changes expected in 2018 in investment banking, mortgages, credit cards, loan growth overall, expense savings. Therefore, I would ignore the report.""

 Rick Wilking | Reuters
Tellers serve customers at the Wells Fargo bank in downtown Denver.
 A key question for bank earnings is the impact of the recently passed tax reductions, through the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, on operations.
Wells Fargo reported a $3.35 billion after-tax benefit, or 67 cents per share, thanks to the tax bill, with a $3.89 billion estimated tax benefit from the reduction to net deferred income taxes. The company also reported a tax gain from the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services. Most other banks are expected to take a loss from the tax act.
Net interest income was $12.3 billion, below Wall Street estimates, which the company attributed to a $183 million negative adjustment related to leveraged leases under the tax act. The net interest margin of 2.84 percent also was slightly below the expected 2.87 percent, according to FactSet.
Return on equity was 11.35 percent, ahead of the 10 percent cost of capital. 
Wells Fargo continues to try to repair the reputational damage it suffered due to the fake-account scandal in which employees trying to hit sales goals enrolled customers in programs without their knowledge. Shares are up about 15 percent over the past 12 months, below the 20.3 percent the KBS Nasdaq Bank Index has returned and the S&P 500's 21.6 percent.
""In 2017 we continued executing on our plan to build a better bank for the future, and I'm proud of the hard work and dedication of our team members to put our customers first as we transform Wells Fargo,"" Sloan said.
The company has been looking to cut costs as part of its rehabilitation effort, and said it is looking for expneses of $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion in the year ahead. Non-interest expenses jumped to $58.48 billion for the full year in 2017, against estimates of $54.62 billion.

 Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, it makes no sense: Richard Kovacevich   
 10:28  AM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  00:51 
 Former Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO Dick Kovacevich told CNBC on Tuesday that he believes bitcoin is a scam.
 ""I think it's a pyramid scheme. It makes no sense. I'm just surprised it isn't even lower,"" he said on ""Squawk on the Street.""
Kovacevich joins a growing list of bankers who have denounced the crytopcurrency craze.
 Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, recently backpedaled a bit on his earlier criticisms on bitcoin.
In September, Dimon called bitcoin a fraud.
In a Fox Business interview last week, he said he regrets making that comment, but added he's ""not interested that much in the subject at all.""
Kovacevich does not see bitcoin as an outright fraud.
""There's no fraudulent thing going on. It's just a pyramid scheme,"" he said. ""You're betting that somebody is going to buy it. And some people have been right.""
""The fundamentals make no sense,"" he contended.
Bitcoin tumbled to a six-week low early Tuesday, falling below $12,000 for the first time since Dec. 5, according to CoinDesk, before paring some of those losses.
Comments from South Korea's finance minister renewed concerns about a crackdown in one of the largest markets for digital currency trading.
Despite cold water from the likes of Kovacevich and Dimon, bitcoin bulls such as Saxo Bank crypto analyst Kay Van-Petersen see amazing upside. Van-Petersen predicts $100,000 this year.

 Analyst raises retail targets after tax plan   
 1:57  PM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  03:51 
 Amid widespread store closures in the retail sphere, some companies have reason to be optimistic.
 For one, fundamentals in the sector are improving, Wells Fargo retail analyst Ike Boruchow told CNBC on Tuesday.
""We are talking about baby steps,"" he said in an interview with ""Power Lunch."" ""Comps for the space have gotten gradually better. Store traffic has gotten gradually better basically throughout the end of last year.""
 On top of that, the slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent should also give U.S.-based retailers a boost, he added.
Boruchow believes the best way to play that combination is Ulta Beauty.
Wells Fargo upgraded Ulta to a valued stock earlier this month. The American cosmetics company is known for allowing shoppers to try on makeup, return used products and even have their eyebrows plucked or hair done in store. 
""This is a name that lagged all of last year, but has some of the best growth prospects in retail,"" Boruchow said. ""You've got a stock that's trading at recession multiples, tax-adjusted with some of the best fundamentals in retail.""
The cosmetics chain opened 100 stores in 2017 and has earnings per share that are expected to rise more than $2 with the new tax plan, Boruchow said. Wells Fargo assigned a price target of $275 on the retail stock, which represents a 20 percent growth potential.
While retail stocks lagged last year, that trend appears to be turning around. The S&P 500 retail index has risen nearly 20 percent in the last three months.
Ulta isn't the only name Boruchow thinks will benefit from the new tax rate. His other top picks include the PVH Corp., parent of the brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger; the Coach parent company, Tapestry Inc., which also owns Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, and Adidas AG.
The new corporate tax rate is ""going to put us in an upward revision cycle for retail, and we haven't seen that in about two years,"" he said. ""That's why the space has lagged so much.""

 A protracted crypto crash would hit stocks, Wells Fargo warns   
 3:58  PM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  02:06 
 A sustained sell-off in the cryptocurrency market will hit the stock market where it hurts, one major Wall Street firm warns.
 It's a scenario investors are underestimating, according to Wells Fargo Securities' Christopher Harvey.
""We see a lot of froth in that market. If and when it comes out, it will spill over to equities,"" the firm's head of equity strategy said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Futures Now."" ""I don't think people are really ready for that.""
 Harvey's comments came as bitcoin, the cryptocurrency market's largest player, tanked. It plummeted 20 percent over two days, recouped much of those losses and then plunged below $10,000 Tuesday afternoon on Coinbase. (On Wednesday, it was at $10,380.)
A two day selling frenzy isn't what's going to affect the stock market, according to Harvey. It's what could transpire when a shock is deeper and longer. 
""What we haven't seen is the depth and the breadth of what could happen,"" Harvey said. ""What we're really looking for is not a one-day event, but multiple days and multiple weeks — something more extended.""
Harvey, who has a S&P 500 year-end price target of 2,863, was one of the first Wall Street strategists to suggest that a cryptomarket bust could hurt the stock market rally. On CNBC in late December, he contended stocks could easily be dragged into the chaos — citing the high levels of speculation and euphoria surrounding the emerging asset class.
In a worst-case scenario, he sees it affecting technology stocks first and then financials. Harvey believes investors don't recognize how much exposure they may have to the cryptomarket through stocks.
""If speculation comes out of the cryptocurrency market, you would expect some of that optimism to start to fade,"" Harvey said. ""Almost every day that market is getting bigger. It's starting to touch more and more parts of the marketplace and different regions of the world.""

 Wells Fargo double charges online bill-pay customers, says it's working to correct the glitch   
 5:28  PM ET Thu, 18 Jan 2018 |  00:44 
 Wells Fargo's banking unit double-charged an unknown number of customers due to a technical error, according to  a report by NJ.com.
 The glitch reportedly affects customers registered to pay their bills automatically online. NJ.com reports that many of those affected were voicing complaints on social media, saying transactions double their bill payments were being deducted by Wells Fargo.
 Howie from Maryland tweet
 Wells Fargo provided the following statement to CNBC.
 ""We are aware of the online Bill Pay situation which was caused by an internal processing error. We are currently working to correct it, and there is no action required for impacted customers at this time. Any fees or charges that may have been incurred as a result of this error will be taken care of. We apologize for any inconvenience.""

 Market selloff presents an opportunity for investors, says Wells Fargo   
 6:03  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  01:49 
 The nearly 400-point tumble in the Dow is something we haven't seen in a while.
 Rather than panic, investors would be wise to roll with the punches, says Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo. These days, big swings are bound to become more common.
""You've got to get used to this — maybe not 400-point days but certainly half percent days, 100- to 200-point days, up and down,"" Wren told CNBC's ""Futures Now"" on Tuesday.
 Wall Street had been spoiled with low volatility and upward-trending days for months before this week's two-day selloff. The CBOE market volatility index hit an all-time low in November and, even now, sits at its lowest level since August.
Tuesday's 363-point skid followed Monday's 145-point drop — a two-day decline of 508 points. That amounted to a two-day slide of 2.03 percent, the Dow's worst back-to-back performance since Sept. 8-9, 2016, when it fell 2.38 percent. The S&P 500 on Tuesday suffered its worst intraday plunge since May, when news broke that President Donald Trump asked then-FBI director James Comey to stop investigating Michael Flynn, his short-lived national security adviser.
In this kind of market, moves such as these should give retail investors reason to buy, Wren said.
""It's nothing but an opportunity,"" said Wren. ""Retail investors should welcome this, they should have a plan. They don't need to wait until the market is off 5 percent to figure out what they want to do.""
A pullback was in the cards after a breakneck pace of record highs to begin the year. The S&P 500 has risen 6 percent in the year to date and is on track for its 10th straight month of gains. At these levels, this would be the best January since 1997.
January's gains only pushed the S&P 500 further into overbought territory. The S&P's relative strength index ended last week at 90, its highest level on record. Its price-to-earnings ratio hit 18.44 times forward earnings this week, its highest level since May 2002.
Even with the potential for pullbacks, Wren remains bullish on the equities market this year. Wells Fargo has a 2,800 to 2,900 price target on the S&P 500, wrapping the S&P 500's current levels as of the Tuesday close. The target suggested 4.5 percent to 8.5 percent upside from where the S&P 500 started the year.
Expected economic expansion and the passage of tax reform pushed Wren to increase his S&P 500 earnings forecast to $152 a share this year from a previous target of $138 a share. This year's target is up from $129 a share in 2017.
For this stage of the cycle, Wren recommends the industrials, consumer discretionary and financials sectors to his clients, sectors that are ""very sensitive to the economy"" and will ""continue to benefit from an ongoing expansion.""
""We want them to be assertive, we do not want them getting defensive,"" he said. ""We want them leaning toward economically sensitive sectors.""
The three sectors Wren recommends are among the top performers on Wall Street this year. The consumer discretionary sector is the best performer on the S&P 500, gaining 10 percent in 2018, while the financials sector is up 6 percent and industrial sector 5 percent.

 Former Wells Fargo CEO: Interest rates have been manipulated by the Fed for too long   
 5:22  PM ET Wed, 31 Jan 2018 |  03:10 
 Former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich said the Federal Reserve has manipulated interest rates for too long.
""I'm surprised interest rates haven't risen more,"" Kovacevich told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Wednesday. They've ""been manipulated by the Fed for far too long.""
 In a robust economy and historically low interest rates many people are anticipating an interest rate hike in 2018. Kovacevich said abnormally low interest rates do impact the number of people refinancing loans. 
He pointed out that while people are more willing to take on new loans with lower interest rates, when mortgage rates that are lower than they should be, mortgage prices are higher. U.S. home prices rose 6.2 percent annually, according to Tuesday's S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index.
""The risk is when you manipulate the rates and all of the sudden they go back to normal the way they should be,"" Kovacevich said. ""You could burst the bubble. I don't think we have a big bubble here, but you certainly have elevated asset prices because of manipulation of the interest rates.""

 Strategist: Volatility is back, deal with it   
 6:03  PM ET Wed, 31 Jan 2018 |  03:51 
 Market volatility is the new normal and there are many ways to make money off it, said Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo.
 ""Now you can start putting your money to work,"" Harvey said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money."" ""Now you have more ability to be tactical. You have more ability to trade around positions.""
Investors can also expand their portfolios and be more selective about where they choose to put their money, he said.
 The market continued on a wild roller coaster ride today following the worst two-day decline since 2016. Stocks were up Wednesday more than 150 points before reversing into the negative, only to climb more than 72 points by the closing bell.
TheFederal Reserve raised interest rates three times last year. But Harvey called the Fed a ""non-event"" in 2017.
""They were sucking volatility and risk out of the marketplace,"" Harvey said of the Fed. 
Still, with more possible interest rate hikes on the horizon in 2018, ""we'll have more spikes in volatility,"" Harvey said. ""But we're not going to go to this elevated period. It's just going to normalize.""

113,2018-02-01,"No bull market ahead for commodities, Wells Fargo says  Wells Fargo scares off biggest customer with new plan  US Treasury curve to flatten and rise gradually: Wells Fargo  ","Krisztian Bocsi | Bloomberg | Getty Images
 Wells Fargo is warning against expecting a bull market for commodities this year, amid several high-profile investor bets on metals and oil.
 Asked if the dollar's decline will result in a runaway bull market in commodities, the bank said in a research note, ""We doubt it.""
""We expect bear market dynamics (over-supply and range-bound prices) to dominate commodities for the next five to 10 years,"" Austin Pickle, Wells Fargo investment strategy analyst, wrote in the note.
 Historically, a dollar bear run occurring alongside a commodities bull run means ""exceptionally high"" commodity returns, according to Wells Fargo, and a weak dollar boosts commodity prices. But despite the recent dollar levels at their lowest in more than three years, the bank does not see bull dynamics ahead for commodities, advising investors to temper their expectations.
""When the dollar bear is fighting against a commodity bear, the commodity bear historically has won, and returns have been low,"" the report said. The forward-looking analysis was also decidedly dollar-neutral, going against many other forecasts of a further weakening dollar in 2018.
""We do not expect a massive move lower"" for the dollar, the report said.
Investors are nonetheless feeling enthusiastic in this sphere. Assets invested in commodities hit $311 billion at the end of 2017, the highest level in four years. In recent weeks, big investment banks have raised their target price for oil as crude futures have risen to multi-year highs. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley both upped their forecasts for crude prices earlier this month, while Goldman Sachs warned oil prices could soon overshoot their current targets.
Copper, palladium, platinum and gold have all seen a pickup in the last three months, and Barclays forecasts rising manufacturing activity in many regions will continue to support commodity growth through 2018. Still, Barclays and others have warned that a possible China slowdown on the horizon risks bringing copper and oil back down from their current highs.
Meanwhile, DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach has made a confident call for commodities, telling clients during a webcast this week that there's ""quite a lot of high octane [gas] in the commodities versus stocks tank"" and predicting ""one or two more bad years"" for the dollar.
The dollar strengthened only modestly following the release of a more hawkish than expected policy signal and confidence on inflation from the Federal Reserve's meeting on Wednesday.

 Federal Reserve orders Wells Fargo to replace four board members   
 6:51  PM ET Fri,  2 Feb 2018 |  03:14 
 The Federal Reserve said Friday it is restricting Wells Fargo's size in response to ""widespread consumer abuses.""
 As a result, Wells Fargo plans to replace three directors by April and a fourth by the end of the year. The Fed is prohibiting the bank from growing any larger than its total assets as of the end of 2017 until ""sufficient improvements"" are made. 
Shares of the bank briefly fell 6 percent in after-hours trading. 
 ""We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank and the consumers harmed by Wells Fargo expect that robust and comprehensive reforms will be put in place to make certain that the abuses do not occur again,"" Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in a statement.
""The enforcement action we are taking today will ensure that Wells Fargo will not expand until it is able to do so safely and with the protections needed to manage all of its risks and protect its customers,"" she said.
Yellen completes her term at the Fed this week and begins at the Brookings Institution Monday.
The Fed did not note any new abuses by the bank in its statement. And neither release mentioned specific names of board members who would be removed.
Wells Fargo said in a release that within 60 days it will provide details to the Fed about a plan for enhancing the board's governance oversight and the company's compliance and operational risk management.
""We take this order seriously and are focused on addressing all of the Federal Reserve's concerns,"" Wells Fargo President and CEO Timothy Sloan said in a separate statement. He noted the order is unrelated to the bank's financial condition, which remains ""strong."" 
Sloan took over as CEO in the fall of 2016 as the bank has tried to recover from a consumer sales scandal. One of those changes was an August announcement for a  board shakeup.
It was discovered in 2016 that Wells Fargo workers had opened about 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization since 2011. The bank paid $185 million in penalties. In 2017, the bank also reached a preliminary class-action settlement of $142 million over concerns about retail sales practices and unauthorized accounts from 2002.

 Cramer weighs in on Fed's action against Wells Fargo   
 7:05  PM ET Fri,  2 Feb 2018 |  01:29 
 ""Widespread consumer abuses"" fueled the Federal Reserve's Friday decision to restrict Wells Fargo's asset size and call for the removal of four of the big bank's board members.
 While CNBC's Jim Cramer was surprised that the Fed didn't do something sooner, Fed Chair Janet Yellen's outgoing move was more brazen than the ""Mad Money"" host expected.
""This is a little more extreme than I thought that [the Fed] might do, demanding that the board change. More importantly, this limit of assets. This stock has been red-hot,"" Cramer noted. ""I don't think you could get a worse piece of news for the incredible ETF that had been the financials.""
 Shares of Wells Fargo briefly dipped by 6 percent in after-hours trading. A cross-selling scandal at the bank made headlines for much of 2017, culminating in a series of fines, downgrades and subsequent unfavorable findings by independent investigators.
""It's actually been one of the leaders in the bank group,"" Cramer said about Wells Fargo's stock. ""It's up 5 percent for the year. And when you cap assets, obviously, you lose one of the best narratives that was occurring at the bank, which is 'We're in recovery mode.'""
Yellen, who ends her term at the Fed this week and starts a position at the Brookings Institution on Monday, said in a statement:
""We cannot tolerate pervasive and persistent misconduct at any bank and the consumers harmed by Wells Fargo expect that robust and comprehensive reforms will be put in place to make certain that the abuses do not occur again.""
""The enforcement action we are taking today will ensure that Wells Fargo will not expand until it is able to do so safely and with the protections needed to manage all of its risks and protect its customers,"" she said.

 Federal Reserve punishes Wells Fargo, caps total assets   
 6:45  AM ET Mon,  5 Feb 2018 |  04:01 
 Analysts are bailing on their bullish calls for Wells Fargo shares because they believe the Federal Reserve's surprising enforcement action will hurt the bank's financial results and hang over the stock for most of 2018.
 The Federal Reserve said Friday it is restricting Wells Fargo's size in response to ""widespread consumer abuses."" The government is prohibiting the bank from growing any larger than its total assets as of the end of 2017 until ""sufficient improvements"" are made.
Wells Fargo shares declined 9.2 percent Monday. At least five Wall Street investment banks downgraded the shares following the news.
 RBC Capital Markets reduced its rating to underperform from outperform, predicting the restrictions will detract from investor sentiment.
""We were surprised by the C&D [cease and desist] considering the amount of money, time and effort the company has already put into remedying the sales practice issues that were disclosed in late 2016,"" analyst Gerard Cassidy wrote Monday. ""Investors will have difficulty determining when the C&D will be lifted, resulting in an ongoing 'cloud' over the stock price and earnings.""
Cassidy cut his price target for Wells Fargo shares to $50 from $65, representing 22 percent downside from Friday's close.
Other Wall Street firms focused on the financial impact from the Fed's asset growth limitations for the bank.
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods lowered its rating to market perform from outperform, saying the Fed's action will hurt the bank's earnings.
""The major takeaway is that we believe WFC will have to be defensive until the C&D is lifted, and that is negative relative to our previous earnings forecast, which reflected the company being offensive,"" analyst Brian Kleinhanzl wrote in a note to clients Sunday. ""We would look to get more constructive when earnings visibility improves, but we expect that to be a year away at the earliest.""
Kleinhanzl reduced his price target for Wells Fargo shares to $63 from $70, representing 2 percent downside to Friday's close.
J.P. Morgan lowered its rating to underweight from neutral, citing the unprecedented nature of the Fed's action.
""The harsh Fed consent order is rare and a strong sign of regulators' frustration about the very wide swath of areas where Wells has had issues (e.g., consumer deposits, consumer lending, small business banking, merchant acquiring),"" analyst Vivek Juneja wrote in a note to clients Monday.
Morgan Stanley also downgraded Wells Fargo to an underweight rating from overweight Monday.
Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 While many of its peers are giving up on Wells Fargo, Bank of America Merrill Lynch still recommends the embattled bank.
 The Federal Reserve said Friday it is restricting Wells Fargo's size in response to ""widespread consumer abuses."" The government is prohibiting the bank from growing any larger than its total assets as of the end of 2017 until ""sufficient improvements"" are made.
Wells Fargo shares declined 9.2 percent Monday. At least five Wall Street investment banks downgraded the shares following the news.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating for Wells Fargo shares, saying the dramatic drop in its shares after the Fed's action is an overreaction.
""We dug deeply into earnings drivers at WFC, between now and 2020. And, while we expect shares to be weak near term, we conclude that EPS cuts of 2-3% are less than the implied after-market decline of 6%,"" analyst Erika Najarian wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""We would view any potential weakness in the shares as a particularly attractive buying opportunity.""
Najarian slightly lowered her price target for Wells Fargo shares to $69 from $70. The new target is 8 percent higher than Friday's closing price.
In 2016 Wells Fargo admitted that employees, facing pressure to meet sales goals, enrolled customers in products without their knowledge, affecting as many as 3.5 million accounts. Last year, it revealed that thousands of customers had been charged for car insurance they did not need. The bank replaced its CEO and remade its board and will name another four new board members this year.
The analyst said Wells Fargo's estimate on the potential negative impact to net profits from the asset restriction is $300 million to $400 million, or roughly 2 percent of the 2018 earnings per share consensus for the bank.
She said the bank will be able to reorient its asset portfolios to maximize its financial results.
""If there is any silver lining for shareholders, it is that the order forces WFC to optimize its balance sheet,"" she wrote. ""We show how WFC can stay under the asset cap and still grow loans and spread revenue, by running off low-value, high cost deposits and shifting excess cash and other low-yielding cash flow into Ginnie Mae securities — without compromising liquidity needs.""
Nearly 60 percent of Wall Street does not have buy ratings for Wells Fargo shares, according to FactSet.

 Fed sanctions will not hurt Wells Fargo brand: Analyst   
 1:38  PM ET Mon,  5 Feb 2018 |  03:43 
 Wells Fargo is not permanently damaged ""in any way, shape or form"" by the Federal Reserve's enforcement action, veteran banking analyst Dick Bove told CNBC on Monday.
 Shares of Wells Fargo fell 8 percent Monday after the Fed said Friday it is restricting the bank's size in response to ""widespread consumer abuses."" Wells Fargo is prohibited from growing any larger than its total assets at the end of 2017 until ""sufficient improvements"" are made.
""This is 1,000 percent political. It has nothing to do with the economics of the company,"" the research analyst at the Vertical Group said in an interview with ""Power Lunch.""
 Bove called the sell-off ""incorrect.""
""There will be no reduction in the ability of this company to lend money, take in deposits or operate the way they have historically,"" he said.
Bove noted that the company hasn't grown its balance sheet over the last six quarters and will be shrinking its balance sheet over the next couple of years.
And that won't have any meaningful impact on earnings, he said.
As for whether Wells Fargo will lose customers due to any damage to the brand's reputation, Bove isn't buying it. In fact, 17 months ago he had a sell rating on the stock on the theory that customers would walk away after the fake accounts scandal — and that didn't happen, Bove said.
He now has a buy rating on Wells Fargo and a $68 price target.
""When the market comes back, Wells Fargo stock is likely to move up sharply higher,"" he predicted.
Other Wall Street analysts, however, aren't sticking with their bullish calls after the Fed's action.
Among those who downgraded the stock on Monday is RBC Capital Markets. Analyst Gerard Cassidy reduced Wells Fargo's rating to underperform from outperform, predicting the restrictions will detract from investor sentiment.
""We were surprised by the C&D [cease and desist] considering the amount of money, time and effort the company has already put into remedying the sales practice issues that were disclosed in late 2016,"" Cassidy wrote Monday. ""Investors will have difficulty determining when the C&D will be lifted, resulting in an ongoing 'cloud' over the stock price and earnings.""
The Fed had no comment on Bove's remarks.

 Strategist: Cryptocurrencies, stock market are trading in tandem   
 6:17  PM ET Wed,  7 Feb 2018 |  04:37 
 If the bitcoin bubble bursts, the stock market may go down along with it, said Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo, who sees a correlation between the two.
 ""On Monday what we saw is all risk products sell off,"" Harvey said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money.""
A hit on the market, he said, can cause investors to panic and begin selling bitcoin as well. 
 ""It sometimes adds fuel to the fire,"" Harvey said. 
Risk in the marketplace was at a high earlier this year as the stock market rallied, which led to more interest from investors who saw the potential for big gains in the crypto market. 
""Last year what you had was money chasing performance,"" Harvey said. As volatility shot up, he said, there was a ""massive"" demand for liquidity.
Then on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 1,175 points by the end of the day. Bitcoin also fell to one of its lowest points in two months on Monday, trading at $5,947.40.
Harvey said the best gauge for predicting future market movement and the price of digital currency is simply by assessing the risk. 
""We think of it more as what we have to watch out for, what we have to ... tell our clients to be careful of,"" Harvey said. ""We don't make a call whether it's going to go up or down but that it's a risk in the marketplace, and it's really far out on the risk spectrum.""

 Wells Fargo raised its price target for equities, up about 10 percent over the next year. Its 2018 S&P 500 year-end target is 2,950, compared with the earlier target of 2,863. Cryptocurrencies and the market should trade in correlation over the next three to six months, it said. 
""If we're right, what we should see is risk product going higher,"" Harvey said. 
""If we're right and risk starts to be bid again, it wouldn't surprise us to see a bid in some of the crypto markets,"" he said. 
All eyes remained on bitcoin Wednesday as the market began to recover. The cryptocurrency was trading above $7,000, even briefly tipping over $8,000 in the evening. 
As the crypto market becomes more regulated some of the risk should disappear, Harvey said.

Traders react after the closing bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
 The recent dramatic pullback in stocks is a big buying opportunity, according to one Wall Street firm.
Wells Fargo Securities predicts the S&P 500 will rise by a double-digit percentage including dividends by year-end 2018. And the bank thinks most of that move will come very soon.
 ""We've been telling clients to slowly and methodically invest their cash as the sell-off unfolded. Now, we're telling clients that they're free to trade (invest the balance of your cash),"" analyst Christopher Harvey wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ""In the near term, we feel the worst is over for stocks and the pullback in the equity market provides almost a free look at earnings.""
""From here, we see almost 10 percent upside for the S&P 500 and we believe all or most of that gain will transpire over the next 3-6 months,"" he added.
Harvey raised his 2018 S&P 500 price target to 2,950 from 2,863, representing 9.5 percent upside to Tuesday's close. 
A stronger-than-expected jobs report and wage number on Friday sent interest rates higher, and sparked a two-day sell-off of 6.1 percent in the S&P 500. Investors were concerned the Federal Reserve will more aggressively reduce its monetary stimulus and increase interest rates as the economy continues to strengthen.
The analyst raised his earnings per share forecast for the index to $150.76 from $146.01 due to the better-than-expected December quarter corporate reports so far this earnings season.
