0,2017-03-14,PayPal shares slide after Google announces rival email feature  ,"Scott Mlyn | CNBC 
Dan Schulman
 PayPal shares dipped about 1 percent on Tuesday after Google said it would make it easier to send and receive money via email.
 The Gmail app on Android now lets U.S. users receive or request money as an email attachment,  Google said in a blog post. It has no fees, and can work even if the payor or payee doesn't have a Gmail account, according to Google.
The feature was already available on web browsers in some areas. But Tuesday's new feature challenges the dominance of PayPal's Venmo in mobile.
 Venmo, a mobile peer-to-peer payment app and social network, is one of the main drivers of growth that keeps PayPal the top person-to-person payments vendor in the U.S., according to analysis by  S&P Global Market Intelligence.  Venmo processed $5.6 billion in payment volume in the fourth quarter, an increase of 126 percent, the company said in an earnings report.
PayPal declined to comment, citing a policy against commenting on stock price moves.

 PayPal beats on top & bottom lines   
 6:22  PM ET Wed, 26 April 2017 |  01:21 
 PayPal shares jumped more than 6 percent after the company reported an earnings beat following the market close Wednesday.
 EPS: 44 cents, versus 41 cents expected by Thomson Reuters estimates Revenue: $2.98 billion, versus $2.94 billion expected by analyst 
The California-based payments company posted earnings of 44 cents per share on revenue of $2.98 billion, up from profit per share of 37 cents on $2.54 billion in revenue a year earlier.
 A consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of 41 cents per share on revenue of $2.94 billion.
The company said it projects adjusted full-year earnings of between $1.74 and $1.79 per share, above the analyst projection for $1.72. 
PayPal also said its board approved a $5 billion buyback. 
""This is one of these quarters where we just hit on all cylinders,"" CEO Dan Schulman said in an earnings call on Wednesday. 
Shares of PayPal were up nearly 12 percent in the past 12 months as of Wednesday's close.

 PayPal CEO points to 2 trends fueling its success   
 7:37  PM ET Tue,  2 May 2017 |  01:18 
 With Wall Street buzzing about PayPal leading the next iteration of financial growth stocks, President and CEO Dan Schulman sees two major tailwinds that could push his business to new heights.
 ""Two big trends are happening: the digitization of money, so from cash to digital, and then in retail, that is fundamentally being redefined by the mobile phone,"" Schulman told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Tuesday.
Schulman said PayPal's network of 203 million users and 16 million merchants stands to benefit hugely from shifting retail trends, especially the rise of e-commerce.

 CEO Dan Schulman points to 2 market-wide trends fueling PayPal's success   
 7:14  PM ET Tue,  2 May 2017 |  09:21 
 ""So much of what [once] happened offline or in-store is now moving online. It's sort of buy online, pick up in-store. And so you're seeing both of those trends play into the strengths that PayPal can offer into the market,"" the CEO said.
Take Venmo, PayPal's millennial-oriented peer-to-peer payment service that went viral with very little marketing.
Venmo just saw its 15th straight quarter in which its user volume doubled, and Schulman said that the time has come to visualize the app's next chapter.
""Now, we're looking to take Venmo to the next level where we can add even more value for Venmo users and allow them to do transactions at merchants,"" the CEO said, adding that the upgrade would allow PayPal to monetize the service.
Along with Venmo's millennial-driven success, Schulman credited PayPal's rise to the company's core beliefs and its many partnerships. 
""Our overriding mantra is to be customer champion,"" Schulman told Cramer. Considering that drove management to give PayPal customers the option to choose how and where they pay, which Schulman said opened the door to partnerships worldwide.
Now, whether PayPal customers are paying in-app, online, or in-store, with their credit cards or their bank accounts, they can do so with networks like Visa, MasterCard, or Discover, through banks like Wells Fargo or Citi, or via technologies like Facebook or Alphabet's Google.
""All of them have now started to become allies in this move to digitization where we can take the best of their assets, and what we have to offer as PayPal, our platform and our scale, put those together and really drive the digitization of payments,"" Schulman said.
And as the world moves online and more and more customers sign on to PayPal's services thanks to the rise of the smartphone, Schulman predicts many changes not only in retail, but the financial services industry as a whole.
""I think there's going to be more change in the next five years than has happened in the last 30 years, and that's because of mobile,"" the CEO said.

 Robert W. Baird reiterated its outperform rating on PayPal shares, one of the market's best-performing stocks, predicting the online payments company's earnings will top expectations next year. ""We believe that the split from eBay represents a rebirth of a platform that already has the benefit of global scale, a trusted brand, and mobile orientation,"" analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""PayPal's significant growth opportunities stem from the disruption in financial services caused by the digitization of money and broader shift to the mobile web."" PayPal shares rallied 35 percent this year through Thursday, compared with the market's 9 percent return in that period. Sebastian raised his price target for PayPal to $59 from $54, representing 11 percent upside from Thursday's close. He cited how PayPal continues to take online payments market share with its transaction volume rising 25 percent per year compared with the e-commerce industry's ""mid-teens growth."" He also noted that PayPal users spend twice as much online as non-PayPal customers, which is attractive to merchants. Sebastian increased his 2018 earnings-per-share estimate for PayPal to $2.18 from $2.08 versus the Wall Street consensus of $2.11. ""PayPal is the largest online payment platform, with leading e-commerce and mobile commerce market share, and millions of merchant partners, leveraging a proprietary cloud-based technology architecture,"" he wrote. PayPal did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

 Apple just announced that iOS 11 will support peer-to-peer payments through a new feature called Pay Cash, making it a direct competitor to similar services offered by Square Cash, PayPal, Venmo and even Facebook.
 Peer-to-peer payments allow one user to pay another one through their smartphone. You might use it to pay a friend for pizza, for example, or to split a meal at a restaurant. It's an industry that's been growing in popularity, and one Apple has been rumored to enter.
Pay Cash will allow you to easily send money to family and friends, transfer it to and from your bank, and to even use it for Apple Pay purchases.
 It'll be a part of iOS 11, which launches later this year, Apple said Monday at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference.

 Customers can swap to the PayPal payment option by opening iTunes and navigating to the settings menu, where it is listed as an option.
The move is surprising since Apple tends to avoid third party services that compete with the tech giant. PayPal didn't say how much of the revenue generated from each purchase will be given to Apple.

 Paypal beats on top line   
 7:57  PM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 |  01:27 
 PayPal shares gained in after-hours trade after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and guidance on Wednesday.
 Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:
 EPS: 46 cents vs. 43 cents expected, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $3.14 billion vs. $3.09 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters 
 PayPal subsidiary Venmo more than doubled its total payment volume, growing 103 percent year over year.
The stock gained more than 3 percent in extended trading after the company's announcement on Wednesday.
The company also raised its guidance for the full year. It now expects adjusted earnings per share between $1.80 and $1.84 on revenue between $12.78 billion and $12.88 billion. Analysts had previously forecast earnings of $1.78 per share on $12.72 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.
PayPal's current-quarter guidance also came in above Wall Street expectations. The company expects earnings per share between 42 cents and 44 cents on revenue between $3.14 billion and $3.19 billion. Analysts expected earnings of 42 cents per share on revenue of $3.13 billion, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates. 
PayPal announced a number of partnerships that would allow the company to extend its international reach. A deal with Baidu in China was among the agreements the company announced.
Shares of PayPal have surged more than 48 percent in 2017, far outperforming the S&P 500's 10 percent gain. The stock set a new all-time intraday high of $59.38 on July 20.
PayPal ascended to a dominant position in the online payments arena since its split with eBay in 2015. After initially resisting pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to separate from PayPal, former eBay CEO John Donahoe acquiesced in 2014.
With Dan Schulman at its helm, PayPal eclipsed eBay both in size and rate of growth since the breakup. PayPal's market cap of $69.9 billion is now close to doubling eBay's, at $38.8 billion.
PayPal's comfortable place in the online payments market has been further buoyed by a slew of recent positive headlines.
In June, wealth management firm Robert W. Baird telegraphed its confidence in PayPal by raising price expectations and reiterating its ""outperform"" rating for the company. The next month, PayPal penetrated Apple's tightly held e-commerce market by scoring a deal allowing iPhone and iPad owners to use PayPal in the iTunes App Store. And the following week, PayPal's partnership with Visa expanded to Europe.

16,2017-08-14,David Sacks: Cryptocurrency fulfills the 'original vision' we tried to build at PayPal  ,"David Sacks is one of the best-known entrepreneurs and investors in Silicon Valley. He was the COO of PayPal more than 15 years ago, which made him a charter member of the so-called PayPal Mafia, a group of influential Silicon Valley investors and execs that also includes LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and early Facebook investor Peter Thiel.
 Sacks started Yammer in 2008 and later sold it to Microsoft for $1.2 billion, and he was an early investor in Facebook, Palantir, Uber, SpaceX and Airbnb. Most recently, he served as CEO of HR software start-up Zenefits, and steered that company through some legal and financial pitfalls after replacing founding CEO Parker Conrad.
 With bitcoin prices hitting new highs, I wanted to talk to him about how he views the rise of cryptocurrencies this year and what he thought of Howard Marks' recent comments in his investor letter that these digital assets ""aren't real.""
Here's an edited version of our conversation from last week:
Eric Jackson: As someone involved with PayPal at the beginning, what intrigues you most about the rise of these digital assets?
David Sacks: After PayPal I never thought I would get interested in payments again. But bitcoin is fulfilling PayPal's original vision to create ""the new world currency."" We actually had T-shirts printed in 1999 with that mission statement.
A payment is just a credit to one account and a debit to another. That's a database entry. We believed that, if we could get enough people to participate, money would never need to leave the system. PayPal could become the database of money.
We added features like interest and debit cards so you'd never have to withdraw funds to the legacy banking system. When we got acquired by eBay, that project kind of stopped.
But cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are now fulfilling that original vision. They are doing it in a decentralized way (with a decentralized database called the blockchain) whereas PayPal tried to do it in a centralized way.
Jackson: You recently tweeted that you thought cryptocurrencies have the chance to be Web 3.0. What did you mean by that?
Sacks: It feels like we are witnessing the birth of a new kind of web. Some people have called it the decentralized web or the internet of money.
The big development since the emergence of bitcoin itself is that the underlying enabling technology, the blockchain, has been turned into a developer platform. The leading platform is called ethereum. It's a platform for creating new kinds of decentralized apps and cryptocurrencies (or ""tokens"" or ""coins""). It's also created a new funding source for this innovation in the form of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). So we have all the ingredients necessary for a whole new wave of innovation.
For those of us who lived through the dot-com era, this feels reminiscent. You have some of the same speculative excess and random enrichment. But you can also feel that something revolutionary is happening. Money is being made programmable. That's a fundamental change with implications we can still barely see.
 """"For those of us who lived through the dot-com era, this feels reminiscent.""""
-David Sacks, early PayPal exec, Silicon Valley investor
 Jackson: That brings to mind the recent investor letter which Oaktree's Howard Marks sent out in which he said that Bitcoin and other digital assets aren't real. What do you say to that?
Sacks: Marks isn't wrong to raise an alarm bell about speculation, but he's wrong in saying it's not ""real."" That's like saying software isn't real. Of course it's real.
Did the U.S. dollar become less real when it stopped being backed by gold? Cryptocurrency is the next step in that same evolution — to make currency more virtual.
In its purest form, currency is confidence. It's a network effect around an agreed-upon medium of exchange that has some promise of scarcity. Bitcoin enforces its scarcity through a combination of cryptography and economic incentives (""cryptoeconomics""). A lot of people find that more comforting than relying on the good faith of a government. In math we trust.
People in the U.S. — and especially longtime participants in the U.S. financial system — have tended to underestimate bitcoin because we have long enjoyed relatively stable political and financial systems. People in parts of the world with less trusted systems have gotten it sooner because almost anything would be preferable to having their life's work trapped in a fiat currency that could collapse or be confiscated at any moment.
Jackson: If the current moment with cryptocurrencies is like the dot-com era, does that make it a bubble, and if so are we in 1995 or 1999?
Sacks: The technology is probably 1995 and the pricing is either 1999 or getting close. It's a combination of something real with a lot of speculation.
What I've been trying to figure out is: Who are the good teams and interesting projects in the space? Also I've been trying to understand the future regulatory environment and invest only in companies that have structured correctly and are likely to survive the inevitable crackdown.
I think the trigger for a big correction is more likely to be regulatory than technical. The SEC provided some important guidance in its DAO report a couple of weeks ago, but we will learn a lot more if there's an enforcement action. That's going to be much more important to the future of this movement than the dreaded bitcoin fork that occurred a couple weeks ago and turned out to be a Y2K-like non-event.
Jackson: So is there going to be a similar three-year nuclear winter when the bubble bursts like what happened after the dot-com boom?
Sacks: Hopefully it will be a soft landing rather than a nuclear winter. It could be a positive thing if all the scammers and pumpers get washed out of the space.
There's going to be a correction though. Many of these ICOs are still just slideware but are getting a Series D type of valuation. They don't deserve that type of valuation at this stage of development. That will rationalize at some point.
Jackson: How are ICOs and future SEC regulation going to mesh?
Sacks: Hopefully the SEC distinguishes between ""protocol coins"" (which have an actual use in a software ecosystem and should not be viewed as securities) and ""asset coins"" (which are securities). The public policy think tank CoinCenter has done some excellent work in laying out the legal frameworks and policy rationales for this.
Until now, most of the action in ICOs has been in protocol coins. The better projects have worked hard to structure their tokens so they are not securities.
However, I believe we will soon see the emergence of asset coins (aka  traditional asset tokens). These will be securities. It must be done correctly, but it's going to be an exciting area.
Jackson: What securities could tokenize?
Sacks: Almost any illiquid asset today lends itself well to moving onto the blockchain and becoming tokenized. It will create a deeper market with improved price discovery and should increase the value of those assets.
In the long run, even liquid assets like stocks could move onto a blockchain because of the benefits of this platform.
Ultimately this is a technology for maximizing the efficiency of every asset, means of ownership, fluidity of markets, and mechanism of payments. The goal is the optimization and maximization of the world economy. That may make it the biggest revolution of all.
Jackson: Are digital assets and tokenization a long-term threat to traditional venture capital?
Sacks: Yes — in two ways.
First, a lot of start-ups that would have sought venture capital can now raise money through an ICO. I've called this ""crypto capitalism"" in contradistinction to venture capitalism.
The terms of crypto capital are more favorable to entrepreneurs than venture capital. So any start-up that can ICO will ICO. Whether a start-up can ICO will depend on technical and regulatory suitability, but it could ultimately be a very large category of start-ups.
If so, that will certainly challenge VC. Larger VCs who would typically invest after the ICO will have to compete with hedge funds, which is not a great place to be. VCs who want to invest before the ICO will have to compete with angels to offer a real value-add.
Second, at the level of the VC's own investors, I think LP interests are likely to be tokenized, along with most other illiquid assets. The prestige VC firms will resist this, but there are already a few new VC firms at the margins that are tokenizing. Soon, a few more will do it. Then a few more. Eventually, illiquidity will be a competitive disadvantage in fundraising that only the top firms will be able to justify.
All of this being said, the SEC's rulings in this area will have a huge impact on how this plays out. If those rulings support innovation, that will lead to a more competitive world for VCs, whose world is already quite competitive. But that world will also be more frictionless and efficient.
Sacks posted a tweet storm about this idea:

 Jackson: What are the biggest challenges that still lie ahead for cryptocurrencies?
Sacks: I see three big areas for concern: scalability, slideware and regulatory.
First, the number of transactions per second that either bitcoin or ethereum can handle is still orders of magnitude less than what PayPal or the Visa network can do. It's been estimated that ethereum, which is the main developer platform for decentralized apps, would need a  250x improvement to run a 10 million user app and 25,000x improvement to run a billion-user app like Facebook. That improvement requires real work and involves some risk. There's a product roadmap, but it's going to take years.
Second, most of the ideas out there today for ICOs are still just white papers, or what we used to call ""slideware."" There is a lot of execution risk in turning these ideas into usable software that actually gets adopted. One fortunate effect of the crypto boom is that it has been helpful in attracting talent to the space. We will need that migration of talent to continue in order to realize the potential.
Third, as we've discussed, will be the extent and nature of regulatory acceptance. The eventual rules governing the application of securities laws to tokens will have a major impact on adoption and innovation in the space, at least in the United States. There is some risk that if the wrong regulatory regime gets adopted in the U.S., then the center of innovation could move to other countries. If blockchains are the next internet, that would be a very unfortunate development for the U.S.
Jackson: We have bitcoin and ethereum plus a number of smaller, lesser-known currencies out there — including the new Filecoin ICO. What lesser-known currencies intrigue you most?
Sacks: I prefer to think in terms of use cases, rather than recommending specific currencies. The most promising use cases to date are: store of value, payments, crowdfunding, file storage, identity management and authentication, prediction markets, escrow, title chains, notary chains, provenance, and supply chains. There are 1,500 ICOs already launched or announced, plus many other blockchain companies, so there's a lot more to come. This is an extremely exciting and fast-moving space.
That said, one admonition I would make to your readers is that most probably shouldn't be investing in ICOs directly. We are seeing white papers for technology that doesn't truly belong on the blockchain or, worse, could be pump-and-dump schemes. Many of the scams originate outside of the United States, so they will be harder to regulate. Just like a lot of retail investors lost money in the dot-com era, the ICO era has the potential to do the same unless people really take the time to understand what they are investing in. A number of professionally managed crypto funds, with real technical expertise to evaluate ICOs, are starting to emerge and may be a safer way to participate than investing directly.
So I would just urge everyone to temper their excitement with sound business judgment. Or does that sound too much like Howard Marks?

 Bitcoin's market value tops that of Netflix   
 3:09  PM ET Thu, 17 Aug 2017 |  00:44 
 Bitcoin climbed above $4,500 to a record high Thursday, giving it a market valuation larger than that of once high-flying technology stock Netflix.
 The digital currency rose about 2 percent to a new high of $4,522.13 on Thursday, according to CoinDesk.
Bitcoin has a market value of about $74 billion, up $30 billion in August and topping Netflix's $72.7 billion market capitalization. Netflix shares Thursday were more than 1 percent lower amid a broader stock market decline. The stock traded nearly 13 percent below its all-time high hit July 21.
 The video streaming stock along with Facebook, Amazon.com and Google's parent Alphabet are collectively known as ""FANG"" and have been U.S. stock market leaders in the last few years as investors bet on the transformative technologies. In 2015, Netflix and Amazon.com were the only S&P 500 stocks to double in price.
 #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(""dw-chart"");$(window).on(""orientationchange"",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});});
 That said, bitcoin is not a stock and comparisons to other stocks' market value, especially major U.S. market gainers like Netflix, are more to illustrate the significant size of interest in the digital currency.
In addition, bitcoin's market value theoretically reflects interest in the potential for bitcoin to become a global means of payment.
At the very least, many digital currency enthusiasts expect bitcoin to become ""digital gold."" But gold's market value of about $7.5 trillion dwarfs that of bitcoin by 100 times.
At Thursday's record highs, bitcoin would rank 72nd by market value in the S&P 500 and 28th in the Dow Jones industrial average, just behind American Express' $78 billion market capitalization.
Bitcoin's market value also tops those of leaders in a variety of major industries, including software company Adobe, financial technology firm PayPal, investment giant BlackRock, industrial company Caterpillar and package shipping company FedEx.
To Ari Paul, chief investment officer of cryptocurrency investment firm BlockTower Capital, a better analogy is comparing bitcoin with PayPal's market capitalization.
""PayPal was initially created with a similar vision to bitcoin — as permissionless money,"" Paul said. ""PayPal wasn't able to fulfill that vision, but bitcoin is well on the way. Bitcoin can be used to transfer $100 million anywhere in the world in 10 minutes and for less than $2. Bitcoin rising in value above PayPal reflects its growing role as the best way to move money globally.""

 However, the three other FANG stocks and Apple, which has the largest market capitalization at $824 billion, still each have market values far greater than that of bitcoin. General Electric, Chevron and MasterCard also have far larger market capitalizations than bitcoin. 
Analysts said bitcoin's latest climb is a relief rally following the uneventful split of bitcoin into bitcoin and bitcoin cash earlier this month. Increased interest in bitcoin, especially from institutional investors, has helped the digital currency more than quadruple in price this year, analysts said.
Netflix shares hold gains of about 35 percent this year but have fallen about 8 percent in August after Disney announced last week it will pull its movies fromthe service and start its own streaming platforms.

 Asia Pacific has no dearth of digital-payment options as smartphone ownership picks up, but cash is still king in most of the region's major markets, according to a new study from PayPal. 
 The report, titled ""Digital Payments: Thinking beyond Transactions,"" found 57 percent of the respondents said they preferred cash for their day-to-day transactions.
Another about 24 percent of the participants said they preferred using other traditional payment methods, such as bank transfer, internet banking and credit or debit cards. 
 Only 12 percent said they frequently used digital wallets to make payments and a very small number of respondents said they preferred contactless methods using their smartphones. 
Geographically, more than 70 percent of the respondents in India, Philippines and Indonesia said they used cash most often. 
In Hong Kong and Singapore, the financial hubs of the region, about 44 percent and 43 percent preferred cash respectively.
Finally, in China, where the likes of Alipay and WeChat Pay have seen massive uptake in recent years, only 25 percent indicated they still preferred using cash for transactions.

 How to build a cashless society? Give people no other choice   
 11:45  AM ET Fri, 11 Aug 2017 |  04:08 
 The report, which surveyed about 4,000 people across China, India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia, also found that despite the preference for cash, awareness of newer methods of payments was high.
Nearly half said they were familiar with digital wallets and 23 percent said they knew what contactless payments using credit or debit cards was, with another 23 percent saying they understood what making contactless payment via mobile phones meant. 
""There's a lot of awareness of digital wallets, but engagement is much, much lower and there's a big gap,"" Rohan Mahadevan, senior vice president for Asia Pacific at PayPal, told CNBC.
That was despite some of the common problems people said they had with cash or credit and debit card transactions, including not having enough cash on hand, lack of easy access to ATMs, long queues in banks or even fees for late payments.
Mahadevan pointed to several reasons why many people still preferred using cash. 
First, there wasn't enough information about each digital payment method, he said. For example, there are various e-wallets, such as PayPal, and also in-app payment systems, such as GrabPay or Uber pay, or digital currencies, including bitcoin.
Yet, many people don't have a clear understanding of what each payment option does and what kind of value it can provide, Mahadevan said. Conversely, cash is a straight-forward option in use for centuries. 
The complexity of setting up a digital wallet or any other online-payment method, such as additional security measures, could also turn people away from using them, according to Mahadevan. 
On top of that, concerns over privacy were always a priority, with users wondering if their financial records will be kept safe, he said.

 Recently, there have been cyberattacks where hackers made away with millions of dollars worth of digital currencies, for example. Those incidents inspire little confidence in using digital wallets. 
""When anybody has a lack of information, they are typically scared about it and they don't want to go and address it,"" said Mahadevan.
But he added that once people start using the wallets, they move up the learning curve ""very quickly,"" so getting people on the first rung was key to driving usage.
The answer, he said, required a collective effort from both the government and the private sector to educate users about digital-payment options.
Additionally, service providers needed to simplify the steps required to sign up for a digital wallet, while keeping it easy to use and secure, he said.
Finally, merchants needed to provide incentives, such as rewards, for payments made with a digital wallet or possible disincentives for traditional methods.
""It's a combination of things that need to come together ... I don't think one industry or one group can achieve the rapid scale of it,"" said Mahadevan.

But as a Musk biographer notes of the idea, ""Musk often explained the concept through pizza, saying that everyone deserved the right to know the location of their closest pizza parlor and the turn-by turn directions to get there. This may seem obvious today — think Yelp meets Google Maps — but back then not even stoners had dreamed up such a service."" Zip2 provided the young, unknown entrepreneur with ways to test his big ideas and bold management style on the fly. Here are 7 lessons from Musk's first business success.See if this sounds familiar: An Elon Musk-founded company strikes on an idea ahead of its time and rises to prominence by revolutionizing a basic service. But it's Musk's original small business, and it's one you may have never heard of: Zip2.Before all the companies with which Musk has become synonymous, from The Boring Company and SpaceX to Tesla and PayPal, there was Zip2, an early online directory that helped users find nearby businesses and provide turn-by-turn directions from a set origin, and allowed small businesses to establish an online presence — all in 1995.

Zip2 provided the young, unknown entrepreneur with ways to test his big ideas and bold management style on the fly. Here are 7 lessons from Musk's first business success.When he was in college, Musk developed his short list of game-changers: in addition to the Internet, the production and consumption of sustainable energy and space exploration. ""Those were the areas that I thought would most affect the future,"" Musk said in a 2012 video interview with tech entrepreneur and podcast host Kevin Rose. ""I was fortunate enough to be involved in those areas. It's kinda my best guess at what would most likely affect the future in the biggest way.""Surprisingly, Musk didn't see an entrepreneurial path in his future. ""In '95, I kinda thought the Internet would be something that would change the world in a major way, and I wanted to be a part of it,"" Musk said in the interview. ""I wouldn't actually try to start a company, I'd try to get a job at Netscape."" When Netscape did not respond to his application, he even tried waiting in the lobby until he became so embarrassed he left.Musk did pretty quickly display an entrepreneurial knack for selling ideas.""Musk built a huge case around a standard PC and lugged the unit onto a base with wheels. When prospective investors would come by, Musk would put on a show and roll this massive machine out so that it appeared like Zip2 ran inside of a mini-supercomputer,"" an effort that an early Zip2 employee told journalist Ashlee Vance for his biography, ""Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.""A lifelong avid reader — including of comic books — Musk relies on reading for historical context. What he doesn't read are business best-sellers.""I don't read many general business books,"" Musk said in the Foundation 20 interview. In fact, Musk said he never had a business mentor, but would look for feedback from the people around him and ""feedback from the historical context"" — books, in other words. He prefers books about scientists, engineers, and of course, entrepreneurs like himself.""I like Franklin's autobiography and a recent written biography on Franklin,"" Musk said, referring to U.S. statesman and historical figure Benjamin Franklin.""I decided to go on deferment,"" Musk said in the podcast with Kevin Rose about his decision to not attend Stanford University for a graduate degree after gaining admission. ""I was just writing software that summer and it got to the start of the quarter at Stanford. I figured if I start a company and it doesn't work, then I can always go back and graduate school.""The department chairman told him he probably wasn't going to hear from Musk again. ""He was correct,"" Musk said. ""I've never spoken to him since.""The original Zip2 office was studio-sized (20 feet by 30 feet), in a building lacking elevators and reliable toilets. The office Internet connection was provided by Musk drilling a hole in the drywall near the Zip2 door and then stringing an ethernet cable down the stairwell to the ISP of an Internet-business below Zip2's office.Musk and his brother, Kimbal, a Zip2 co-founder, kept their clothes in a small closet and showered at the YMCA, according to Vance's biography. The Musk brothers took meals (sometimes four a day) at the local Jack in the Box. Elon was prone to sleep in the office on a beanbag next to his desk and asked employees to kick him awake when they came in so he could get back to coding. When an intern borrowed their car, the wheels literally came off along the way, cutting a groove into the pavement.If you're in business for the first time, buckle up — you better be in it for the long haul.Even when the Musk brothers and their team couldn't sell anyone on Zip2's actual product, one way the sales team's confidence was kept up was through seeing the continual improvements Musk was making to the software. But Elon was less good at managing staffers, especially when it came to giving criticism.""You would see people come out of the meetings with this disgusted look on their face,"" A Zip2 salesman told Vance. ""You don't get to where Elon is now by always being a nice guy, and he was just so driven and sure of himself.""Musk's first wife told his biographer, ""Elon is not someone who would say, 'I feel you. I see your point of view,. Because he doesn't have that 'I feel you' dimension there were things that seemed obvious to other people that weren't that obvious to him. He had to learn that a twenty something-year-old shouldn't really shoot down the plans of older, senior people and point out everything wrong with them. He learned to modify his behavior in certain ways.""Employees at SpaceX let off steam by playing video games, a tradition that stretches back to early days at Zip2 where stress ran high and, at least early on, success was no sure thing, according to Vance's biography.While at Zip2, Musk even formed a video game team to participate in Quake competitions, which came in second and won several thousand dollars. ""We would have come in first, but one of our top players' machine crashed because he had pushed his graphics card too hard,"" said Musk in an interview for Vance's book. After Zip2 secured venture capital funding, backers pushed the company to hire a professional CEO. Musk himself initially supported the idea, he said during the Foundation 20 interview, hoping it would free him up to work on software and product direction. But the decision turned out to be disastrous for the company, Musk said. ""The company succeeded in spite of that person, not because of them."" The concept is most obvious in the quandary between shareholder and stakeholder. ""At the time I thought it was a good idea,"" said Musk. ""I didn't really know what I was doing.""It's a learning experience that seems to have stuck with Musk to this day, given the tight control he retains over his current companies.

22,2017-09-27,"PayPal's next acquisition target could be Square, Stripe, or Adyen, analyst predicts  ","Mark Neuling | CNBC
Dan Schulman
 PayPal could make a major acquisition worth billions of dollars in the ""coming months,"" Bernstein analyst Lisa Ellis wrote in a note Wednesday.
 Ellis mentioned some of the largest payment companies as potential acquisition targets, including Square, Stripe, and Adyen. Square, which went public two years ago, has been one of the hottest stocks this year and is now worth more than $10 billion, while Stripe and Adyen are each valued at $9 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, according to Pitchbook.
Why would PayPal want to make a deal that expensive?
 Ellis wrote PayPal has been open about its intention to buy growth lately, and has been focused on expanding its geographic footprint and user demographic in order to maintain its mid-20s percent growth rate. The company's also sitting on a huge pile of cash, which Ellis estimates to be roughly $15 billion in total. The recent merger between Vantiv and Worldpay, and Visa's minority stake in Klarna could fuel PayPal's urgency to make a deal happen, as well, she wrote.
But given more than half of PayPal's revenue comes from the U.S, Ellis wrote the acquisition is more likely to be a European company, such Adyen or Klarna. 
""We believe a strategic acquisition will most likely be positive for PayPal's stock, particularly if it enables geographic expansion oruser engagement – two critical long-term growth drivers for PayPal,"" Ellis wrote.
PayPal most recently bought Swift Financial for an undisclosed amount. Its biggest deal in history took place in 2015 when it bought Xoom for $890 million.
PayPal and Stripe declined to comment. Square and Adyen were not immediately available for comment.

 PayPal beats on top and bottom line   
 8:02  PM ET Thu, 19 Oct 2017 |  01:14 
 PayPal posted a strong earnings report Thursday as Venmo payment volume nearly doubled year over year.
 Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:
 EPS: 46 cents vs. 43 cents expected, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $3.24 billion vs. $3.18 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters 
 In the year-ago quarter, PayPal reported earnings of 35 cents, representing 31 percent growth year over year. Revenue grew 21 percent from $2.67 billion a year ago.
The payment company also raised its full-year outlook. It now expects earnings of $1.86 to $1.88 per share on revenue of $12.92 billion to $12.98 billion.
Shares were last seen trading more than 4 percent higher in after-hours trade.
 Venmo, one of PayPal's most popular payment methods, processed $9 billion in payments in the third quarter, nearly doubling year over year. ""In addition to our solid financial performance, we also reported record customer growth with the addition of 8.2 million net new actives,"" said CEO Dan Schulman in a statement. ""As the world rapidly accelerates to digital payments, we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us."" PayPal announced Tuesday that Venmo users will be able to use their account to pay online for purchases from most merchants that accept payments through its parent company. The company's march to fame comes after the company parted with eBay in 2015. After initially resisting pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to split from PayPal, former eBay CEO John Donahoe finally agreed in 2014. With Dan Schulman at its helm, PayPal eclipsed eBay both in size and rate of growth since the breakup. PayPal's market cap of $80.9 billion is now roughly double eBay's, at $40.7 billion.

Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook is making a new push into the payments space by expanding its partnership with PayPal.
 Facebook Messenger users can now send and request money directly in the app via their PayPal accounts.
Facebook Messenger and PayPal initially partnered last year to enable customers to link their accounts and use PayPal to shop on Messenger. The new announcement expands the partnership into peer-to-peer payments. 
 At the moment, the peer-to-peer payments system is only available in the U.S., where PayPal has over 2.5 million accounts that are already linked to Facebook. 
Additionally, PayPal customers can now use a customer service chat bot in Messenger allowing them to reset passwords, handle account inquiries and helping with payment issues in the app.
Facebook has been working on bringing payments to its platforms for some time, and this latest push makes it a competitor to other peer-to-peer payments options such as Apple's new Pay Cash, Square Cash, Snapchat's payments and PayPal's own Venmo application.
Correction: 2.5 million PayPal accounts are linked to Facebook in the U.S. The company had more than 218 million customer accounts worldwide as of Sept. 30, and 99 million in the U.S. as of Q2.

29,2017-10-26,Billionaire investor Peter Thiel: Silicon Valley’s monopoly on big growth tech companies is over  ,"Peter Thiel is a heavyweight entrepreneur and investor who made his career in Silicon Valley. He launched and took public online payments company PayPal, was an early investor in Facebook and Airbnb and went on to launch software company Palantir Technologies. But now the billionaire says that Silicon Valley's monopoly on technology company growth is over.
 ""I have been investing in the technology space — entrepreneur and investor over the past 20 years in Silicon Valley — and within the area of IT, it has for the last 10, 15 years in the US and the world been extremely centered on Silicon Valley,"" Thiel says, speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Thursday.
""I think there are a lot of reasons for that, but the question is, 'Where is the growth going to happen the next 10 years?' And what I would tend to think is that it will be more diversified from just Silicon Valley.""
 The concentration of global tech companies in one small region in California has been a peculiar feature of the industry.
 ""There was something very paradoxical about it all being in Silicon Valley, because after all these Internet companies are global in scope,"" Thiel says. ""They can be built anywhere. You just need some talented people, some capital, the right governance structures and so it was always this very odd question, why all the companies of this new global technology were built in one specific place.""

 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 Until this point, the growth of successful tech companies being nearly monopolized in Silicon Valley has been largely due to the concentration of knowledge about entrepreneurship and the presence of mentors, Thiel says.
""The answers for that had to do with network effects and knowledge and role models, but I think at this point, I would bet on places outside of Silicon Valley.""

 California still sees a disproportionate percentage of venture capital deal flow. In the third quarter of 2017, California was home to  580 companies receiving venture capital investment, according to the  most recent data on the industry from the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook. New York had the second highest number of venture capital deals with 188, or 32 percent of the number of deals closed in California.
But when Thiel is thinking about where the next big technology deals will be, he thinks globally.
""The one big place outside of Silicon Valley over the last few years has been China, where there have been some spectacular companies started,"" Thiel says. ""I don't think there is a single other place, it is not a specific city or specific country, but I think in general there is much opportunity outside of Silicon Valley.""

 Fintech will change more in next 5 years than the last 30: PayPal CEO   
 7:13  PM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  01:19 
 Millennials are changing a host of industries, but perhaps none more drastically than the financial technology space, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman told CNBC on Monday.
 ""You have to, to serve these markets, re-imagine how money can be managed and moved because there's going to be more change in the next five years in financial services than happened in the past 30,"" Schulman told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer.
PayPal's peer-to-peer payment app, Venmo, speaks volumes to the way younger generations interpret money management, the CEO said.
 ""If you think about the under-30 generation, the millennial generation – GenTech, as I call them – they grew up with a screen in front of them. And so they think about everyday processes, like payments, differently than you and I do,"" Schulman told Cramer. ""The public-private boundaries are different than what you and I grew up with.""
""For Venmo, they put a tag or an emoji on every one of their payments,"" Schulman continued. ""It's really not a P2P service, it's a social payments experience. And they love doing it. They open the app just to see what their friends are doing.""
Today, Schulman said the person-to-person payment business is valued between $35 billion and $40 billion. In five years, its projected value is estimated to reach $335 billion.
Similarly, ""online digital payments today are about $3 trillion,"" the CEO said. ""By 2020, three years from now, it's supposed to be over $8 trillion. And we're a leader in that market right now with 218 million people using the platform, so we just got to keep delivering on what customers want, merchants want and to stay that market leaders.""

 The Facebook-PayPal relationship keeps getting friendlier.
 The companies announced Tuesday that PayPal users can send invoices over Facebook Messenger, expanding a partnership announced last month that allowed Messenger users to link to their PayPal accounts for sending and receiving money. 
The agreement is moving from peer-to-peer payments to include the buying and selling of products in Facebook's marketplace. PayPal's buyer protection is also available for transactions.
 Sellers can create an invoice within Messenger and then send it to the buyer. This is available in the U.S., where PayPal has over 2.5 million accounts that are already linked to Facebook.
By partnering with PayPal, Facebook Messenger becomes a competitor to mobile payment services like Apple's new Pay Cash, Square Cash, Snap and PayPal's own Venmo application.

33,2017-11-30,Peter Thiel's powerful tech network reportedly predates PayPal and goes back to a college newspaper  ,"Getty Images
Venture capitalist Peter Thiel of the Founders Fund and other technology executives and leaders attend the inaugural meeting of the American Technology Council in the Indian Treaty Room at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door to the White House June 19, 2017 in Washington, DC.
 Peter Thiel has connections across Silicon Valley thanks to ties he forged as co-founder and CEO of payments company PayPal more than 15 years ago.
 Dubbed the ""PayPal Mafia,"" the group includes some of the region's most successful entrepreneurs, such as Tesla founder Elon Musk, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, Yammer founder David Sacks, Affirm founder and CEO Max Levchin and many more. 
But a new report from a Stanford University student news site points to a bigger and more powerful Thiel network -- one that dates back to his days as a college student in 1987.
 As an undergraduate at Stanford, Thiel co-founded a libertarian newspaper called the Stanford Review. According to a story in the latest issue of Stanford Politics, a rival publication, some 23 former editors or staffers from Thiel's paper are connected to data analytics start-up Palantir, either as a current or former employee or board member.
The secretive software company in Palo Alto, California, near the Stanford campus, is valued at $20 billion.
Palantir has done work with more than a dozen U.S. federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, the NSA and the CIA, whose venture arm was among the company's earliest investors. Palantir's technology gathers information from public and private databases and examines it to find patterns and anomalies that can prove useful to its clients.

 6:12  PM ET Tue,  7 March 2017 |  01:24 
 Three of the five Palantir co-founders — Thiel, Joe Lonsdale and Stephen Cohen — served as editors-in-chief of the Review, which has advocated a conservative or libertarian agenda throughout its three decades.
According to Forbes, more ofThiel's wealth is derived from his stake in Palantir than from his early investment in Facebook, which made him a billionaire. 
Now, Thiel and the Stanford alums at Palantir, already a force in technology and government, could be in a position to gain more influence over America's national security apparatus.
Thiel reportedly is being considered by President Trump for a position on the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, which is tasked with providing oversight of America's intelligence community. Thiel was previously part of Trump's transition team, and in June Palantir CEO Alex Karp joined a group of tech CEOs in a meeting with Trump at the White House.
Karp has said he would prefer to keep Palantir private, rather than going the IPO route, a move that would shield its finances from public scrutiny. 
An email sent to a Thiel spokesperson did not receive a reply.

Max Levchin
 PayPal co-founder Max Levchin believes in blockchain technology, but isn't quite so sure about bitcoin.
""It's a brilliant mathematical idea, fantastic technology, interesting commodity to speculate on,"" he told CNBC on the red carpet of the Breakthrough Awards on Sunday, December 3. ""TBD on whether it's a currency or just a way to make money fast. I invest in things that I have a strong, long-term point of view on and bitcoin I'm still trying to figure out.""
 Investors are certainly making money right now. The Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, just became the first bitcoin billionaires. Since the brothers first invested in bitcoin, the cryptocurrency's value has increased over 9,000 percent. 
While bitcoin is a specific cryptocurrency, blockchain is the technology that underlies it. There is an increasingly large number of other blockchain-based currencies, including ethereum and litecoin. Generally, benefits of blockchain are that it allows for fast, secure and anonymous financial transfers. 
""I think a form of a blockchain technology, bitcoin or otherwise will be essential and will not go away,"" Levchin said. ""Not only that, it will continue advancing and being used in many different industries from financial technology to medicine. But it's not clear to me whether Bitcoin itself is the great long-term investment.""

 PayPal shares plummeted 10 percent in extended trading on Wednesday, after longtime partner eBay said it's going with a new payments provider.
 EBay will start processing payments using PayPal rival Adyen. When customers check out, they will have the option to stay on eBay and use Adyen's services or leave the website and use PayPal. Adyen will also provide reduced costs for sellers and a simpler pricing structure. 
EBay and PayPal have also negotiated new terms through July 2023. This new deal does not extend the previous operating agreement, which would have expired in 2020. 
 Though they were part of the same company for 13 years, eBay and PayPal were split into independent standalone businesses in 2015.
EBay, which reported earnings on Wednesday, brought in $2.61 billion in revenue during its latest quarter. It also posted earnings of 59 cents per share. Both estimates were in line with analyst expectations, and the stock rose more than 6 percent during after hours trading. 
PayPal also reported earnings on Wednesday, posting $3.74 billion in revenue and earnings of 55 cents per share during its latest quarter.
After doubling in the past year and closing at a record $85.32 on Wednesday, PayPal shares sank 10 percent after hours to $76.58.

38,2018-02-01,Why eBay abandoned PayPal for a smaller European competitor  ,"John Phillips | Getty Images | TechCrunch
Pieter van der Does, CEO of Dutch payments firm Ayden.
 E-commerce giant eBay announced Wednesday that it will be replacing PayPal with Adyen as its primary payments provider.
 PayPal posted better-than-expected results that same day, but this was enshrouded by the news of eBay looking to eventually replace it.
It sent shares of PayPal — a company with a market value of more than $100 billion —  down sharply in U.S. extended trading Wednesday. PayPal's stock continued to plummet Thursday, while shares of eBay rose near a record high.
 What is Adyen?
 Adyen, a much smaller start-up based in the Netherlands, is an online payment company that provides businesses with backend payment services including credit card processing and point-of-sales (POS) systems.
It was last valued at $2.3 billion following an  investment round led by Iconiq Capital, and has since been encircled by rumors of going public. While co-founder and CEO Pieter van der Does has not yet disclosed a date on an eventual initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg has reported that an IPO could come as  early as this year.

 How Adyen is gaining ground in the e-commerce space   
 8:43  PM ET Thu, 18 Feb 2016 
 PayPal may be one of the most established payment services providers around, but it has been faced with fierce competition from a multitude of big payment players such as Square, Stripe and iZettle.
And Adyen's business is  profitable, but its size pales in comparison to U.S. giant PayPal.
So why did eBay, which owned PayPal up until 2015, choose to abandon it for a smaller European competitor?
 'Lower costs' for merchants
 The company explained in a statement Wednesday that its decision to integrate Adyen's payment processor would result in lower costs and more control of finances for its merchants.
The move is a part of eBay's strategy to ""transition to full payments intermediation,"" the firm said.

 Ebay jumps on strong guidance   
 7:45  PM ET Wed, 31 Jan 2018 |  01:43 
 EBay said its partnership with Adyen's technology would enable sellers to have a more central view of their data, and to manage and track all transactions and customer interactions via eBay.
Adyen processes the backend payment services for businesses using its technology, which means users do not necessarily interact with Adyen directly.
With PayPal, however, users must sign up for a PayPal account and interact with its interface before completing a transaction.
Adyen also boasts a huge clientele that includes the likes of Facebook, Arbnb, Spotify, Uber and Netflix.
 'Integrated checkout experience'
 EBay said that the integration of Adyen would also provide customers with ""greater choice"" when checking out.
""We believe that we can offer a more seamless experience while giving buyers and sellers more choice for payment and payout options,"" eBay Chief Executive Devin Wenig said on a conference call with analysts, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The firm added that it would be able to expand payment options into more regions around the world. Adyen lets consumers pay in 150 currencies.
It will also let buyers manage checkout within eBay, rather than being directed to PayPal before completing a purchase.
In an emailed statement to CNBC, Adyen CEO and co-founder Pieter van der Does said: ""We are thrilled that eBay, one of the most successful e-commerce companies of all time, has chosen Adyen as its new, global payments processing partner. Adyen is uniquely positioned to meet the needs of high volume global marketplaces like eBay. We look forward to powering transactions on eBay, starting in North America, and supporting their continued global growth.""
EBay will continue to let customers use PayPal as an option for checking out until July 2023, but most of eBay's payments will be processed by Adyen by 2021.
The firm said in its statement that PayPal would ""remain an important partner to eBay.""

39,2018-02-06,Ex-PayPal executive David Sacks explains how his new company will change crypto trading  ,"I interviewed David Sacks last August about his interest in cryptocurrency. His interest was well-founded as the whole asset class took off last fall.
 In a recent report by Axios, Sacks said he's raised a new venture fund with partner and well-known Silicon Valley angel investor Bill Lee. It felt like a good time to reconnect with Sacks, the former COO of PayPal and CEO of Yammer, and get his first on-the-record comments on that fund (including its name), as well as a new start-up he's incubated since last year and which is formally announcing its Series A financing Tuesday (called Harbor), and his continued interest in the cryptoasset space.
Here's an edited version of our discussion from a few days ago:
 Eric Jackson: Since we last spoke, you launched a new investment fund. Tell us about it.
David Sacks: For the past two decades, Bill and I have been angel investors as well as entrepreneurs. So we're doing what we've always done, in terms of helping other founders, except now we can write larger checks. The fund is called Craft, which represents our view that company building is a craft that we've learned over the course of founding four companies with successful exits. The same lessons play out time and time again even though the technologies constantly change.
Jackson: Are you focused specifically on crypto investments?
Sacks: Blockchain is a major theme, but we have a broad interest in next-wave technologies. We recently invested in Bitgo to fund its acquisition of Kingdom Trust, creating the first full-stack solution for institutional custody of cryptocurrency. But we've also made investments in Cloud9, an esports company, and SpaceX. The common denominator is supporting founders who are creating unique, market-defining products.
Jackson: Let's talk about Harbor — a decentralized compliance protocol designed to standardize the way crypto securities are issued and traded on the blockchain that launched Tuesday with a $10 million Series A round. What problem is Harbor solving?
Sacks: Harbor solves compliance for asset tokenization. The idea first came about when Bill and I were raising the new fund. We asked whether it would be possible to do it through an ICO (initial currency offering). The short answer is that the compliance challenges of issuing a regulated security on the blockchain make it extremely difficult. At the same time, we felt that there is an enormous opportunity for the blockchain to bring more liquidity and transparency to private securities. So we incubated and seed-funded Harbor to solve that compliance problem.
Jackson: Coincidentally, I recently interviewed Stephen McKeon — a University of Oregon finance professor — for CNBC about tokenizing traditional assets.
Sacks: Steve has spoken and  written very articulately about the potential for tokenizing traditional assets like real estate. It was very much in line with our thinking, so we reached out and started talking. Steve is now an advisor to Harbor.
Jackson: How does Harbor solve the problem?
Sacks: Today Harbor announced the Regulated Token Standard, or ""R-Token"", which is a standard ERC20 token, except it contains additional code to check an on-chain whitelist (called a ""Regulator Service"") before it trades. The Regulator Service can be configured to enforce any number of regulatory requirements — from securities to tax laws, across multiple jurisdictions. In addition to the basics like KYC, AML and accreditation, it can be customized for specific types of assets like real estate, which require tax withholdings on foreign investors under FIRPTA.
When a trade is requested, the R-Token checks with the Regulator Service to make sure that the investor has been verified and meets all the legal requirements; otherwise the token throws off an error message and will not transfer. This ensures that every trade is compliant.
Harbor is making R-Token available to the blockchain community as an open-source standard. This includes publishing the smart contracts for R-Token and the Regulator Service. We want to help standardize how tokenized securities are issued and traded.
Jackson: There have been some recent announcements about new exchanges for crypto securities. Does R-Token compete with those?
Sacks: The problem with relying exclusively on centralized exchanges for compliance is that trades can always happen outside their walled garden. R-Token bakes compliance into the token itself, so it works regardless of whether it's an ICO or a secondary trade, whether it's traded on an exchange or person-to-person. We hope exchanges will adopt R-Token — there's no reason for them not to, and it provides a more complete solution.
R-Token also has the advantage of being compatible with decentralized exchanges, which is a major emerging theme in crypto. We are investors in the 0x Protocol (token: ZRX), which allows for the exchange of ERC20 tokens without the need for a trusted intermediary. There's an exciting ecosystem of developers building on 0x.
Jackson: Why did you build R-Token on Ethereum?
Sacks: R-Token would work fine on other blockchains, but there are big advantages to using Ethereum. The killer feature of Ethereum is ERC20, which creates a standard interface for tokens. By building the R-Token standard as an additional layer on ERC20, all security tokens issued as R-Tokens will automatically be compatible with all the wallets and exchanges that already support ERC20. Yet, R-Tokens are fully compliant securities.
Jackson: But what about scalability? The big knock on Ethereum is that it's not scalable. Is that your biggest risk in backing Harbor or making any bet on Ethereum?
Sacks: If we had to move off Ethereum, we could, but I'm pretty optimistic scalability will get solved. Historically, scalability has been a high-class problem that occurs because a new technology gains rapid adoption. That popularity is precisely what attracts the resources necessary to solve the problem. This has been the pattern going back to our own experience with early scalability challenges at PayPal or to the ""fail whale"" at Twitter.
Jackson: Is it your view that the utility tokens we've seen in ICOs in the past year or so are going to move to become security tokens eventually?
Sacks: I think there's a very legitimate argument that utility tokens are not securities, because they perform a role in a software ecosystem and are more akin to a software license. That said, R-Token could provide a migration path if regulators decided otherwise.
That's not part of our plan, however. We're really focused on helping to create a new category of regulated asset ICOs. There have been thousands of ICOs for utility tokens. There have only been a couple of ICOs for securities. That seems very out of whack to us. In the long run, we actually think there should be more asset tokens than utility tokens, because there are far more assets in the world than viable open-source software protocols.
Jackson: What do you think the future of security tokens looks like?
Sacks: I'm a token maximalist. I believe that a wide range of assets and many forms of value will ultimately tokenize because ownership belongs on a blockchain. After all, the original reason why the blockchain was invented was to track ownership. It was originally ownership of bitcoin, but it could be ownership of any asset. In one of your previous interviews, Balaji Srinivasan made the point that ownership will get blockchained the same way that content got packetized. I agree with that.
If you told people in the early 1990s that every disparate form of content — TV, movies, music, news, photography — were all the same thing and would all be turned into packets on the internet, massively disrupting those industries, people would have thought you were crazy. Something analogous is true today about the disparate forms of ownership that will ultimately be blockchained. As a start, open-source software protocols, security tokens, derivatives, prediction markets — all of these will be turned into ERC20 tokens in 2018.
This is one of the themes we are building our investment portfolio around — to facilitate a complete framework for a crypto-securitized world: Bitgo/Kingdom Trust for institutional security/custody; Harbor for the creation of ICO-able security tokens; and 0x Protocol for the discovery of counterparties and decentralized exchange. If we look forward five to 10 years, we envision all of these pieces interacting to create a new kind of global, digital capital market that is built on standard interfaces and open-source software, and therefore is a new platform for a wide variety of innovation that is just getting started.
Jackson: Thanks, David.
