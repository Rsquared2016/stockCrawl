 Citi has joined JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and others in a Series A funding round for distributed ledger technology (DLT) start-up Axoni.
 The New York-based capital markets focused firm now has over $20 million from investors including Wells Fargo, NEX Group, Thomson Reuters, F-Prime Capital and Digital Currency Group (DCG), among others, who contributed to the funding round in December. Series A is the first significant round of venture capital funding.
Axoni is involved in some trials of DLT, also known as blockchain technology, in the financial markets where its technology is being tested for trade affirmations in the reference data arena and in the over-the-counter (OTC) equity swaps post-trade lifecycle operational segment.
 This later project was announced in January. It involves Citi and other major Wall Street banks in a collective effort to overhaul the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) Trade Information Warehouse (TIW) using DLT. All the major banks use the warehouse.
Commenting on the latest Series A funding from Citi, Greg Schvey, CEO of Axoni, said in a statement that: ""Having the support and domain expertise of such a world-class institution will allow us to execute our vision even more broadly and rapidly. We are delighted to have Citi join Axoni's investor group.""

 LevelUp, a U.S. mobile app financial technology (fintech) firm, has raised $50 million in finance from long-term investors JP Morgan Chase and U.S. Boston Capital and from newcomer CentroCredit Bank. Its latest fundraising round brings the total raised by the start-up so far to just over $85m.
 The corporate offers its one million app users a month a range of loyalty rewards, analytics and payment options from partner restaurants, merchants and banks, including brands like sweetgreen, Tropical Smoothie Cafe, Potbelly Sandwich Shop, and nearly 200 other restaurants across the U.S.
Its technology is used to power aspects of the Chase Pay mobile payments app, particularly the in-store loyalty and rewards programs and the order-ahead payment options offered by merchants that have signed up with LevelUp.
 Partners can use its technology on a white-labeled basis to offer new loyalty, customer engagement, transaction and other functionality to their end users.
The new money raised will be spent on hiring new staff, product development and further expansion across the U.S.
Existing investors include Google Ventures, Highland Capital, Balderton Capital and Continental Advisors which is led by Phil Purcell, the founder of Discover Card. The first money used to establish the business came from the Princeton Business Plan Competition, which LevelUp founder Seth Priebatsch won during his freshman year.
LevelUp then entered an incubator, Dreamit Ventures, to develop the business further with the help of mentors and seed investors, and is now entering the latter stages of venture fundraising as it attempts to scale up.
""LevelUp has grown rapidly over the last several years and this funding sets us up to accelerate our growth this year and next,"" said Priebatsch. ""We're thrilled to have the continued support of our existing investors including Chase and U.S. Boston, and great new partners like CentroCredit Bank.""

7,2017-07-03,This is what Americans are willing to sacrifice 20% of their salary for  How the oil price is impacting the wider global economy  European equities are still the right place to be: JPMAM  ,"The security that comes from getting a set amount of money on a regular schedule is so attractive to Americans that they are willing to sacrifice up to 20 percent of their salary for it. And yet that stability is as elusive as it is alluring.
 A national average of 55 percent of Americans experience serious income fluctuations month to month, according to new research from JP Morgan Chase & Co., meaning that what workers bring in can vary by over 30 percent. And, their experts report, ""the typical household"" isn't set up to ""weather this volatility.""
That's stressful, since not knowing how much money you're going to earn in any particular pay period makes it hard to budget. Yet given the vagaries of the gig economy and the fact that even some corporate employers make a habit of tweaking or announcing schedules at the last minute, it can be hard to know how much you're actually going to be able to bring in. 
 No wonder so many Americans are living paycheck-to-paycheck.
 Young people and lower-income workers are particularly vulnerable, since 70 and 74 percent of them, respectively, are forced to cope with this kind of income volatility. The New York Times reports that ""virtually every major retail and restaurant chain"" puts their workers through some version of this, since tech advances make it possible and also because ""managers are often compensated based on the efficiency of their staffing.""

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 But almost all Americans are affected, JP Morgan reports, noting that ""the decline in real wages since 2009 for all income groups except the top 5th percentile means that life is harder to afford in general, but even more so when earnings dip below average.""
According to their findings, ""median income individuals experienced nearly $500 in labor income fluctuations across months, with spikes in earnings larger but less frequent than dips.""
Transitioning from one job to another, as four out of ten of those surveyed did in a year, leads to shifts in pay, but even a seemingly stable job is often at fault: ""Most of the month-to-month volatility in take-home pay (86 percent) came from variation in pay within distinct jobs.""
The New York Times concurs, reporting that ""a new wave of research shows that the main culprit is not the so-called gig economy, but shifting pay within the same job,"" and adding that ""turbulence has replaced the traditional American narrative of steady financial progress over a lifetime."" 
As a result, according to the Times, ""stability is worth a lot to workers. On average, employees are willing to  give up a fifth of their weekly wage to avoid a schedule set by an employer on a week's notice.""
Experts encourage everyone to keep three-to-six months' worth of expenses in an emergency fund to cope with an accident, crisis or layoff, and former CNBC host Suze Orman suggests you aim to put away enough to support yourself for about a year. Unfortunately, most Americans aren't able to meet that goal: The majority of them have under $1,000 saved, total. Half of all workers in the U.S. have nothing put away for retirement.
To help create that kind of buffer for yourself, JP Morgan suggests that ""key, predictable savings opportunities include December to March pay spikes, five-Friday months for individuals with jobs that pay every two weeks or weekly, and tax season for those who receive tax refunds."" Those are all good chances to squirrel away extra cash.

9,2017-07-25,Why UK equities might be the best ship to sail through Brexit  ,"Justin Tallis | AFP | Getty Images
A Union Jack flag flies near the Elizabeth Tower, commonly referred to as Big Ben, at the Houses of Parliament in central London, U.K., on March 29, 2017.
 The FTSE 100 might be your best investment option amid growing domestic volatility in the U.K. economy, analysts at JP Morgan said.
 There are three reasons increasing the attractiveness of U.K. stocks: global valuations are too high, U.K. valuations are cheap and they're affected by global growth, which looks solid at the moment.
""Despite popular skittishness, U.K. valuations actually look very good,"" James Illsley, fund manager at JP Morgan U.K. Equity Core fund, said in a note to investors.
 ""The market itself is cheap. Valuations are actually about 20 percent below long-term averages, on a cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. And more importantly in practical terms, U.K. equities look a relative bargain compared to cash that yields virtually nothing and bonds that are yielding less than 1 percent,"" Illsley pointed out, adding that the average dividend yield is about 4 percent.

 Are UK stocks a bargain?   
 10:05  PM ET Thu,  8 June 2017 |  01:20 
 The FTSE 100 registered its biggest daily gain since April in mid-July. In May, the index broke two new highs surpassing the 7,500 mark on a weaker pound. The drop in the currency has supported British stocks, given that in most cases these companies make their profits in dollars.
As a result, U.K. stocks are mostly affected by global growth dynamics rather than by the British economy, which has been volatile due to the uncertainty surrounding its future relationship with the European Union.
The International Monetary Fund revised downwards its growth forecasts for the U.K. whereas it kept its global outlook unchanged. The IMF said Monday that the U.K. is set to grow 1.7 percent in 2017 and 1.5 percent in 2018.
Meanwhile, the global economy is seen increasing by 3.5 percent this year and by 3.6 percent in 2018.
According to Illsley, the attractiveness of U.K. equities should therefore remain intact. ""In terms of valuations I can't see the case being eroded,"" he told CNBC Tuesday. ""Asset classes might change, but from a valuation perspective the scenario remains the same.""
He preferred not making forecasts on a sectorial basis, given their volatility to different macro-economic scenarios, but said that stocks like the Bank of Georgia are a good opportunity. The bank is listed in the U.K. but has no exposure to the U.K. economy and is currently benefiting from a fast growing performance in the Georgian economy.

 Twitter shares jump after JP Morgan upgrade   
 5:13  PM ET Mon, 18 Dec 2017 |  01:04 
 J.P. Morgan upgraded Twitter to overweight from hold on Monday, boosting shares of the social media stock, which have been staging a comeback this fall.
 ""We are upgrading TWTR shares to overweight with a $27 price target,"" analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note. He called it ""one of our top"" small- to mid-cap picks for 2018.  
""We believe both the TWTR story and financial results will strengthen over the next year as the company continues to build on its differentiated value proposition for users & returns to revenue growth,"" he wrote.
 The new $27 target (up from a previous target of $20) represents 22 percent upside over the next 12 months from Friday's close. Twitter jumped 6 percent in early trading Monday.
Anmuth laid out four reasons behind the upgrade:
 Video and live streaming improvement. He now estimates 10 percent daily active user growth next year. He estimated advertising revenue growth greater than 8 percent in 2018. He also said Twitter should be ""GAAP profitable"" in 2018. 
After struggling the previous three years as bigger rival Facebook reached higher and higher heights in terms of user numbers and stock price, Twitter rebounded in the second half of 2017 as investors bet the stock had reached a point that made it a value given its core user base that it had yet to truly effectively monetize.
 ""We recognize that TWTR shares are up 30 percent since 3Q earnings in late October and are not cheap at 11.8x 2019E EBITDA on our revised numbers,"" wrote Anmuth. ""But we believe increasing traction with both users and advertisers will drive upside to 2018 consensus (we are 4 percent above on revenue & 15 percent on EBITDA) and investor sentiment around TWTR remains mixed.""
Twitter reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue numbers for the third quarter, but monthly active users were about inline. Twitter shares are up 36 percent in 2017.

A worker moves a bin filled with products inside of an Amazon fulfillment centre in Robbinsville, New Jersey, November 27, 2017.
 The importance of online retail and Amazon's dominion over e-commerce have no end in sight, according to J.P. Morgan.
 Citing Amazon's growing market share and the success of Amazon Web Services, analyst Doug Anmuth argued that Jeff Bezos' retail giant is only just getting started.
""We believe Amazon is well positioned as the market leader in e-commerce, where it's still early days with U.S. e-commerce representing about 12 percent of adjusted retail sales (ex-gas, food, and autos), which we view as likely going to 30 percent over time,"" Anmuth wrote Monday. ""We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall e-commerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party vs. third-party inventory and its Prime offering both serve as major advantages.""
 As one of Main Street's largest disruptors, Amazon roared through 2017 by keeping pressure on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, sending entire industry groups tumbling after it acquired Whole Foods Market over the summer. Though countless companies have shed share value, Amazon's stock has climbed more than 58 percent since January, one of the best large-cap performances this year.
Anmuth's new $1,375 price target on Amazon shares is 17 percent higher than Friday's closing price. Shares closed up 1 percent Monday.
Though it is known for pairing consumer goods with logistical prowess, Amazon has seen significant growth in its cloud platform, known as Amazon Web Services. As a secure cloud services platform, AWS offers its users computing power, data storage and content delivery to help scale businesses, according to its website.
""We believe AWS is the leader in the public cloud with roughly 75 percent U.S. market share, and it remains early with only about 10 percent or more of workloads in the cloud today and the pace of cloud adoption accelerating in our view,"" explained Anmuth. While the analyst offered positive outlook on Amazon, he also remarked on social media companies Twitter and Facebook and on Priceline.
Calling Twitter one of J.P. Morgan's best ideas in 2018, Anmuth upgraded shares and raised his price target on the popular platform to $27 from $20, implying 21 percent upside over the next 12 months. After an unimpressive start to the year, Twitter staged a 43 percent climb in the past six months — a trend the analyst believes will continue with daily active user growth and scaling ad revenue.
And Anmuth's $225 price target on Facebook reflects his belief in 25 percent upside for the stock in the next year.
The analyst is also bullish on online travel agent Priceline, increasing his price target to $2,050, which is 16 percent higher than Friday's close. His old price target was $1,950.
""We continue to think Priceline is the best in class in online travel with strong growth driven by scale benefits, efficient performance & brand spend, and large and growing supply,"" explained Anmuth. ""We also believe Priceline has the potential to re-accelerate in mid-2018 as comps ease and stepped-up investments start to reap benefits.""

Hunter Harrison of Canadian Pacific in 2013.
 Shares of CSX Corporation rebounded to close up 1.25 percent Monday in the wake of CEO and railroad turnaround specialist Hunter Harrison's passing on Saturday. Shares had early fallen near 2 percent in early trade.
 The executive was renowned in the industry for his ability to save struggling freight railroads, having spent years reforming two of Canada's largest railways before taking the helm at CSX in March.
The company said on Friday that Harrison was placed on medical leave. A day later Harrison died at age 73. He had been suffering from an undisclosed medical condition that forced him to work from home some days and use an oxygen machine at times, according to the Wall Street Journal.
 ""Harrison's legendary ability to redesign a rail network with his Precision Scheduled Railroading model created the two most efficient operations in North America and we believe his legacy will continue at CSX,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Brian Ossenbeck wrote on Sunday. ""When those transformational changes stressed the CSX network to a near meltdown in August, service issues that would have crippled the old system for over a year only lasted a few months. This experience built immediate trust in Harrison and faith in the PSR model which continues to operate more efficiently than U.S. peers.""
Central to the PSR model is a set of principles designed to improve operating efficiency, including minimizing car dwelling times, reducing car classifications, and balancing train movements by direction. Harrison's model was central in turning around the Canadian National Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway, now two of the most successful systems in North America.
Though Harrison and CSX hit roadblocks (both customer and regulatory) throughout the CEO's first few months at the company, the chief's role in redesigning the company has already set a new trajectory for the railway.
""We continue to point out that CSX has the highest degree of network control of any U.S. rail, providing a foundation to deliver the consistently high service levels critical for PSR,"" added Ossenbeck. ""CSX also operates the lowest track densities which provide scope for improving operational efficiencies through rationalizing the network and improving balance in the system.""
But J.P. Morgan wasn't alone in its optimistic outlook on CSX. Credit Suisse analyst Allison Landry noted that acting CEO Jim Foote is likely keen on continuing Harrison's work.
""We think there is a reason why Mr. Harrison chose Mr. Foote as his #2 at CSX — and we believe we got a glimpse of that at the Credit Suisse Industrials conference,"" wrote Landry on Friday. ""Management emphasized that there were still plenty of opportunities to improve the network from the previous system of comingling intermodal and merchandise freight to implementing scheduled railroading — which will drive down costs and improve profitability. We remind  investors that Jim Foote was a key architect of what we now know as Canadian National's highly successful and industry leading intermodal franchise.""
Though the company's stock has sold off since Friday, J.P. Morgan and Credit Suisse encouraged investors to stick with the shares. Ossenbeck reiterated his buy rating, as well as his $63 price target, which represents 19 percent upside from Friday's close. Landry kept CSX at overweight and reiterated her $61 price target, or 15 percent upside.
Over the past 12 months, shares of CSX have soared roughly 47 percent.

 Homebuilders' performance surged in 2017 and should continue its trend upward next year, according to J.P. Morgan, which highlighted key growth drivers and top stocks for its clients.
 ""So far in 2017, our homebuilder universe has delivered its best performance in nearly 15 years, up 64 percent on an absolute basis and 43 percent on a relative basis, which represents the group's strongest gains since 2003,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Rehaut wrote Tuesday.
He added that sector rotation in consumer discretionary stocks as retail fell out of favor earlier this year combined with optimism on corporate tax reform have been ""the two most important drivers of the sector's outperformance.""
 With homebuilding expected to perform well in 2018, J.P. told investors that one company in particular looks ""highly attractive"" from a valuation standpoint.

An employee walks near an Abbott Laboratories sign at the company's headquarters complex in Abbott Park, Illinois.
 Abbott shares rose 3 percent Tuesday after J.P. Morgan Chase upgraded the stock and raised its price target, citing growth potential from the company's new products. 
 The firm upgraded Abbott to overweight from neutral and raised its year-end price target to $65 from $60. Shares were at $58.98 in early trading Tuesday. 
Abbott could benefit from the U.S. launch of five products: the FreeStyle Libre glucose monitoring system, the Alinity family of next-generation core lab systems, the HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist system, the Confirm Rx implantable cardiac monitor, and the MRI-compatible implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, analyst Michael Weinstein wrote in a note. 
 FreeStyle Libre offers the most room for upside, Weinstein said. The product is the first continuous glucose monitoring system on the market that doesn't require patients to prick their finger to draw blood. 
It's one development in an area that's ripe with change and innovation. Abbott is aggressively pricing and marketing the product, probably to take advantage of its window as the only product of its kind. Rival Dexcom expects to introduce its own sensor that wouldn't require fingerpricks by the end of 2018.
 Source: Abbott 
 JPMorgan Chase expects FreeStyle Libre to do almost $550 million in sales in 2017, on target to generate more than than $1.5 billion by 2022. The analyst forecasts $68 million in sales in 2018, with upside up to about $100 million if Abbott secures either commercial reimbursement, Medicare reimbursement, or labeling for kids earlier than expected.
Overall, JPMorgan Chase anticipates Abbott's organic growth reaching 5.5 to 6 percent this year. Weinstein is forecasting sales of $30.51 billion, above Street expectations of $30.12 billion.  
""In our view, it's the new product launches that are not being forecasted correctly, with big discrepancies between our estimates and the Street's in Diabetes (+$93M), Electrophysiology (+$66M), and Heart Failure (+$64M),"" Weinstein wrote.
""While we are $60M ahead on Nutritionals, part of that could be due to differences in FX [foreign exchange] as we model reported growth at +4.1% and FX-neutral growth at 2.8%,"" he wrote. ""We model Diabetes, Heart Failure, and Electrophysiology (in aggregate 13% of sales) growing at double-digit CAGRs [compound annual growth rates] through the end of the decade.""

 We can get 3% growth but it's a one-hit wonder: JP Morgan's David Kelly   
 1:42  PM ET Tue,  2 Jan 2018 |  02:52 
 The U.S. is capable of reaching of 3 percent GDP this year, but growth is likely to slow after that, strategist David Kelly told CNBC on Tuesday.
 Productivity ""really is the key,"" said Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan. The unemployment rate could ""go down to its lowest level since 1969. Three-point-four percent by the end of the year. But if we get there, that's really as low as it's going to go. So, growth will have to tapper out at 2 percent next year.""
""In other words, we can get 3 percent growth, but it is a one-hit wonder,"" Kelly said in the interview on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""One year of 3 percent and 2s for as far as the eye can see.""
 The Commerce Department reported last month that the U.S. economy grew at its fast pace in more than two years in the third quarter, expanding at a 3.2 percent annual rate
Kelly also said it's reasonable to expect the stock market to have a correction after 2017's record run. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq had their best years in four years.
""The average correction in about any given year is 14 percent,"" Kelly said, ""and we've been very far from that in the last year. But it'll get more interesting as the year goes on.""
Also on ""Squawk on the Street,"" strategist Jim Paulsen said the stock market rally could be ""even more impressive"" than last year. But he also predicted a correction in 2018. 
""There's certainly a lot of positive momentum,"" said Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.
""Who knows how high it'll go before it corrects,"" he added.

A ceremony to start manufacturing new CAT 777A haul trucks at the Caterpillar Tosno factory.
 Shares of Caterpillar rose Monday after J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock, citing expectations for another strong year ahead in light of the Republican tax reform.
 ""Although we missed out on Caterpillar's outperformance in 2017, we believe that there is still significant upside to the stock,"" analyst Ann Duignan wrote in a note to clients. ""The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act supports replacement of equipment at an accelerated pace through 2022 as both new and used equipment are now eligible for expensing, a positive for Caterpillar's North American end markets.""
Shares of Caterpillar, which have climbed 74 percent climb over the past 12 months, rose 2.1 percent following Duignan's bullish call.
 As a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, Caterpillar has helped lead the index to record highs during the past several months, joining other industrial giants like Boeing and 3M in a charge to all-time highs. Caterpillar closed at a record $161.96 on Friday.
The analyst raised her price target on the company to $200 from $144, representing 23 percent upside over the next year.

 GoPro hires J.P. Morgan to put itself up for sale: Sources   
 1:42  PM ET Mon,  8 Jan 2018 |  01:25 
 GoPro hired J.P. Morgan Chase some months back to help it seek a potential sale, according to people familiar with the matter.
 J.P. Morgan helped underwrite GoPro's initial public offering in 2014. No sale is assured, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private, and GoPro is not in any active talks with a buyer. It's unclear if there is an interested acquiror for the company. GoPro declined to comment.
GoPro CEO Nick Woodman CNBC earlier Monday that the company would consider a sale or partnership with another company, though it plans to remain independent.
 ""If there are opportunities for us to unite with a bigger parent company to scale GoPro even bigger, that is something that we would look at,"" Woodman said.
Shares of GoPro were down 19 percent in midday trading Monday, after the camera maker said it was laying off about 20 percent of its workforce and lowering guidance after a weak holiday season. 
Late last year, GoPro said it would lower prices for its Hero5 Black cameras after weak demand. The company said it expects revenue of about $340 million for the fourth quarter after projecting $470 million for the quarter in November. 
— CNBC's Josh Lipton and Michelle Caruso-Cabrera contributed to this report.

 MGM Resorts represents the gambling sector's most compelling option in the new year, according to J.P. Morgan.
 Though the company had a turbulent 2017, analyst Joseph Greff told clients that investors are underestimating MGM and that the company is likely to surpass expectations during earnings.
""We believe MGM represents the gaming sector's most attractive risk/reward for 2018, as it is now the best absolute value play in gaming,"" wrote Greff on Tuesday. ""We continue to like the stock here as we believe investor expectations are reasonably low – we'd say almost negative, but probably more in the 'I don't give a hoot' camp.""

Pedestrians walk in front of an electronic stocks indicator showing the numbers on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in the window of a securities company in Tokyo on Nov. 16, 2017.
 Global investors should not be put off by current equity market valuations and now is not the time to ""de-risk"" portfolios, according to one global market strategist.
 ""Despite the strong rally, valuations have not changed much since the start of 2017 in Europe, U.K. and Japan, as earnings have grown strongly,"" Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said in a new report Tuesday.
""It is only emerging markets and the U.S. which have seen valuations creep higher as share prices rose by more than earnings expectations. With emerging market valuations starting from a low base, only U.S. valuations look somewhat expensive compared with their long-run average,"" he added.
 In the eyes of J.P. Morgan, a healthier U.S. labor market; easy credit conditions in Europe and data indicating further equity price gains in 2018 support the idea that there's further room to run in the stock market.
However, some analysts do not agree with this assessment. Peter Toogood, chief information officer at Embark Group, told CNBC last week that in the current market conditions, there is little on offer that's interesting.
""Bonds are insane and fixed, equities are on highs that don't make sense … The only diversifier is gold and cash, that's the only thing left, because everything is expensive, period,"" Toogood said. Also, Sonja Laud, head of equity at Fidelity International, told CNBC that ""there's not a lot left"" for those seeking to make returns in the short term.
""Am I willing to go for the last percentage points or do I much more enter the camp of protecting the downside? That's a very interesting question,"" she said.

 5:57  AM ET Tue,  9 Jan 2018 |  02:17 
 Nonetheless, Bell from J.P. Morgan is confident on equities in 2018 as he believes the global economic picture looks healthier.
""To me the greatest risk is that we get a pick up in inflation that causes the Fed to over-tighten,"" Bell told CNBC Tuesday morning. He added: ""Realistically I think it's pretty unlikely that you'll get enough of a tightening this year to cause problems.""
J.P. Morgan Asset Management forecasts between three and four new rate hikes by the Fed in 2018 — above the two rates that the market is expecting, according to a Reuters analysis of fed funds futures traded at the CME Group.
""We believe the equity market could withstand even four rate hikes this year but that if inflation was accelerating and that caused the Fed to hike a further three to four times in 2019 that could start to slow the economy in 2019 or 2020 causing problems for equities as they start to anticipate recession,"" Bell told CNBC.
Mark Haefele, global chief information officer at UBS, also said in a note on Wednesday that ""it still makes sense to be invested in equities.""
""We don't expect the same pace of gains as last year, but remain confident of positive equity returns. Our view is supported by solid global growth, the prospect of strong corporate profit growth and a supportive monetary policy backdrop,"" he said.

 J.P. Morgan reiterated its overweight rating for Amazon shares, predicting strong growth for its internet advertising business.

 Anmuth raised his price target for Amazon shares to $1,385 from $1,375. The new target is 11 percent higher than Tuesday's closing price.
The analyst noted that the company only has 10 percent share of the U.S. online advertising market compared to its 42 percent share of e-commerce sales. Facebook and Google dominate the global online ad market outside of China, the note said.
""We believe advertisers and agencies would welcome a third scaled digital player,"" he wrote. ""Amazon is best positioned in our view, with its in-market customers, scale, strong access to data, shopping history, ability to close the loop, & leading market share in smart home speakers with Alexa/Echo.""
As a result, Anmuth predicts Amazon's ad business will generate sales growth of more than 60 percent this year.

 JP Morgan beats Street on top and bottom line   
 8:16  AM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  02:48 
 J.P. Morgan Chase on Friday reported earnings that topped Wall Street's expectations after accounting for charges related to the tax law. 
 The bank revealed it took a $2.4 billion charge in the fourth quarter due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Here's how the company did on an adjusted basis after that charge:
 EPS: adjusted $1.76 vs. $1.69 expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $25.45 billion vs. $25.15 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters 
The shares, which are up 31 percent in the last 12 months, closed up 1.65 percent Friday to hit an all-time high.
Despite the one-time charges, CEO Jamie Dimon praised the bill.
""The enactment of tax reform in the fourth quarter is a significant positive outcome for the country. U.S. companies will be more competitive globally, which will ultimately benefit all Americans,"" Dimon said in the release. ""The cumulative effect of retained and reinvested capital in the U.S. will help grow the economy, ultimately growing jobs and wages.""
Dimon said on a call with the media that the company will be announcing something for the bank's employees ""in the coming weeks"" related to the tax bill.
It was a difficult trading environment for the bank. J.P. Morgan said its fixed income markets revenue declined 34 percent year over year driven by ""continued low volatility"" and ""tighter credit spreads."" The company's equity markets revenue was flat versus the previous year. 
The company returned $6.7 billion in capital to shareholders during the fourth-quarter with $4.7 billion in net stock buybacks.
Its shares rallied through year-end after the bank reported better-than-expected third-quarter results in October. 
Analysts expect the financial sector to benefit from the Republican tax overhaul, which President Donald Trump signed into law last month. The plan lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
J.P. Morgan expects its fiscal 2018 effective tax rate to be around 19 percent.
KBW Research had estimated J.P. Morgan's 2018 effective tax rate will decline to 22 percent from 35 percent due to the tax plan.  
J.P. Morgan is one of the largest financial services companies in the world with assets of $2.5 trillion.

 JP Morgan CFO Lake details $143 million fourth-quarter trading loss   
 9:21  AM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  01:54 
 J.P. Morgan Chase on Friday revealed it took a huge loss from a trading-related loan to a single client in the fourth quarter.
 ""Equity markets revenue was flat compared to a strong prior year and included the impact of a mark-to-market loss of $143 million on a margin loan to a single client,"" the company said in its release. 
The bank said its equity markets revenue would have been up 12 percent without the client loss for the quarter.
 J.P. Morgan failed to name who the specific client was but said on a call with the media that it was ""a syndicated margin loan facility to related parties"" of Steinhoff International.
The bank said it was likely that other financial firms had exposure to the same client. Steinhoff is a South African retailer whose shares plunged at the end of last year.

 Now watch the banks   
 6:46  PM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  00:52 
 After hours of marveling at the tape's incessant march higher, CNBC's Jim Cramer took a step back to check the market layout.
 ""What's driving it? ... Same as always: [a] stock shortage — it's really been acute in the industrials — 401(k) money being thrown at the market, animal spirits, a stronger consumer, tax reform, deregulation and a general revaluation higher,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Who's doing the leading? Once again, it's Boeing, it's Caterpillar, it's Adobe, it's Alphabet, it's Apple, and it's Netflix.""
Certainly, the layout can change. On Friday, shares of frequent market leader Facebook were taken down after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wanted to change its News Feed to promote ""meaningful social interactions.""
 But Facebook's 4 percent decline failed to jolt the broader market. Instead, a strong earnings report from J.P. Morgan propelled its stock and the market to new highs, erasing worries that one-time charges would make the numbers look worse than expected.
""J.P. Morgan's a terrific place to actually start the discussion for next week's game plan because it did set a benchmark that other banks, which all report next week, I think are going to find hard to beat,"" Cramer said.
With that in mind, the ""Mad Money"" host turned to the stocks and events he'll be watching next week:
 Tuesday: Citigroup, UnitedHealth, CSX
 Citigroup: Citigroup's chief financial officer said in December that the bank could take a $20 billion hit because of the newly passed tax law, which could weigh on its Tuesday morning earnings report.
""I believe its buyback has been so aggressive that the company will actually still end up showing some excellent earnings growth, even as it's clear from J.P. Morgan's numbers that fixed income trading — a big revenue generator for both J.P. Morgan and Citi — was much worse than even thought,"" Cramer said. ""Citi will be hard-pressed to top J.P. Morgan, but it's no slouch.""
UnitedHealth: Cramer expected ""still one more blowout quarter"" from the massive health insurer, packed with insight from its rapidly growing data-driven business.
CSX: Railroad operator CSX will report its earnings after the bell. Shares of the transport play have recovered bountifully since its late CEO Hunter Harrison passed away in December, but Cramer wasn't sold on the stock.
""If the rails have a weak link, it will be CSX because it has run so much,"" he said.
 Wednesday: Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, ASML Holdings
 Bank of America: Bank of America may not have J.P. Morgan's global ""tentacles,"" but with the largest deposit base in the United States, it's the top beneficiary of rising interest rates, Cramer said ahead of its Wednesday earnings report.
Goldman Sachs: Cramer was hopeful that Goldman would find a way to deliver a positive earnings report despite lower than expected trading volumes in the fourth quarter.
""It's a much more trading-oriented investment bank, and lately, the markets have lacked the kind of volatility that translates into terrific profits,"" he said. ""I'm more concerned here, though, that [CEO] Lloyd Blankfein, who's steered the bank through the hardest of times, may decide to hang up his spurs and devote the rest of his life to charity, which would be par for this incredibly good man's course. I say, not yet, please.""
ASML: Cramer wanted this oft-overlooked semiconductor equipment maker's earnings report to give investors more details on whether there's too much new semiconductor capacity on the market.
""If we hear that orders are through the roof from this equipment maker or that anyone's canceling them because they've been through the roof, I could see the commodity chipmakers like Micron disappointing with some weak stock action,"" he said.
 Thursday: Morgan Stanley, PPG Industries, IBM
 Morgan Stanley: Cramer didn't envy Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman for having to report earnings after the rest of the big banks set the bar.
""I think [the results will] be excellent. But by this point, will anybody really care?"" Cramer wondered. ""Aren't we more likely to see a wave of profit-taking once all the big banks have reported? You know what, that's actually a reasonable bet. Let's keep our eyes open.""
PPG: Industrial coatings maker PPG will report earnings before Thursday's bell, and Cramer expected a good report.
""I also think [PPG] could be on the verge of a value-enhancing merger,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""If I owned it, I would certainly stay long. If it gets weak earlier this week, I would buy it.""
IBM: Cramer advised investors to listen to IBM's conference call, led by CFO Martin Schroeter, before reacting to the computer giant's after-the-bell earnings report.
""[The headline numbers] can often be hard to understand until Schroeter explains them,"" he said. ""[IBM] just started a new mainframe cycle and that, historically, has been good news for the company. Plus, Warren Buffett seems to have stopped selling shares, thank heavens, and that's good news for the stock.""
 Friday: Schlumberger
 Oilfield service company Schlumberger will report earnings on Friday coupled with one of Cramer's favorite conference calls in the industry.
Since Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard called oil's bottom last quarter, the price of crude has rocketed to multi-year highs, so Cramer was eager to hear his insights.
 Final thoughts
 ""Here's the bottom line: you have to respect the fact that we're in a once-in-a-lifetime move where even when a mega-cap stock like Facebook gets slammed, it has no pin action whatsoever on the rest of the market,"" Cramer said. ""You know what we've got here, don't you? We've got a beast. Still, on Tuesday, the beast is going to come in real hungry after a couple days off. I bet it gets fed once again.""

 JP Morgan's quarterly results 'mediocre' across the board: Bank analyst   
 7:35  AM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  03:17 
 A good start to the year is only going to get better for J.P. Morgan Chase, according to veteran banking analyst Dick Bove.
 In the wake of fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations despite a weak trading environment and a write-down from tax reform legislation, Bove, of the Vertical Group, said the largest U.S. bank is poised for big gains ahead.
In fact, he raised its price target to $128.45, a level that suggests a 14 percent gain from Friday's close. 
 ""My view of this company is that it is probably the best bank I have ever followed in 5 decades of analyzing companies,"" Bove told clients in a note.
He is keeping his buy rating on J.P. Morgan as the stock already has gained more than 5 percent in the new year. The company last week posted quarterly earnings of $1.76 a share on revenue of $25.45 billion, both well ahead of consensus estimates.
Though Bove himself, in a CNBC interview, called the results ""mediocre,"" he sees the environment overall for banks as highly conducive to large profits and sold gains for share prices.

Pedestrians walk outside a JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chase bank in Chicago.
 ""It appears that in 2018 the banking industry and JP Morgan Chase will enter a new financial world which will provide this company with further opportunities to grow,"" he said. ""In the new era, it is very possible that the valuation of JP Morgan and its industry will expand, a process that is already well underway.""
Banks are being seen as big beneficiaries of the tax cuts Congress enacted in December.
In its earnings presentation, J.P. Morgan said its effective tax rate would be 19 percent, compared with 35 percent prior. That in itself should provide the bank with a nice cushion, even though it had to take a $2.4 billion charge for 2017 because of the tax legislation.
In his note to clients, Bove reiterated his view that Q4 numbers were ""not impressive."" However, he still holds a positive outlook due to the bank's ability to negotiate a number of obstacles.
""Whether investors look at reported numbers (as I do) or managed numbers, quarter-over-quarter, revenues were down and expenses were up,"" he wrote. ""Admittedly, one-time events impacted the numbers but the biggest impact was in the tax adjustment not the operating numbers.""
While other bank stocks have underperformed, J.P. Morgan's return of about 60 percent over the past two years has about doubled the S&P 500.
""An assessment of JPMorgan Chase in recent years indicates that this management has been wrestling with a hostile environment and yet it has been able to maintain its stability,"" Bove said. ""The stock price is indicating that this environment is about to change meaningfully in a very favorable direction.""

 Winners & losers from JP Morgan Healthcare Conference   
 7:36  PM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  01:18 
 Of all the major conferences that kicked off 2018 — from the ICR confab to the tech-laden CES — the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference was the most important for CNBC's Jim Cramer.
 ""This meeting tends to make major waves in the health care stocks,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The problem is the announcements from these pharma and biotech companies often read like they're written in hieroglyphics. It can be very difficult to understand this stuff without a medical degree or a PhD in chemistry.""
So, to help investors make sense of what often proves to be a groundbreaking event, Cramer went through the biggest winners and losers from J.P. Morgan's San Francisco, California-based health care convention.
 Winners
 Coming in first in terms of stock performance was Atara Biotherapeutics, up 52 percent since the start of 2018. Most of its move came after the J.P. Morgan conference.
The cause? Atara, a small company that develops immunotherapy treatments for cancer and multiple sclerosis, announced that the FDA approved one of its multiple sclerosis drugs for a Phase 1 study.
Better yet, Atara has a treatment for the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes mononucleosis, or mono) in Phase 3 trials — one step away from an FDA review.
""Put it all together, though, and it feels like the investors are warming to speculative biotechs again, even with the tape showing signs of raggedness today,"" Cramer said on Tuesday.
Up 47 percent for the year, Alder Biopharmaceuticals was the conference's second-biggest winner. Another small, development-stage biotechnology player, Alder announced strong clinical trial outcomes for its top medication, a migraine prevention drug.
""I like the story that CEO Randall Schatzman told us last week,"" Cramer said. ""But remember, Alder's still a very early-stage company and there are plenty of pitfalls remaining before FDA approval, including, by the way, the fact that some competitors are ahead of them in the process.""
Other notable winners include Coherus Biosciences, a generic drugmaker with a 43 percent gain, and Illumina, a DNA-sequencing play up over 10 percent after the company introduced a new, low-cost sequencing machine.
(Cramer did caution investors about Coherus, which he saw as a commodity business with no patent protection.)
 Losers
 The J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference's biggest loser by far was Axovant Sciences, a company working on treatments for Alzheimer's disease and dementia.
Cramer has watched Axovant's stock get totally decimated in recent months, the first wave of losses coming after the Phase 3 clinical trial for its lead drug missed the mark.
The second negative wave came after the same drug failed to reach its primary endpoint in studies for treating dementia; the third came after Axovant announced that it had wrongly released positive data about a separate treatment for hallucinations.
""That's how a stock goes from $5 to $2,"" Cramer said. ""I think this is a powerful reminder of what happens when you buy a stock without doing the homework, especially when you're dealing with a overly promotional management team.""
Tesaro, which makes cancer-related drugs, came in second among the losers, with a stock down more than 20 percent since the beginning of 2018.
Cramer attributed the decline to the fact that Tesaro recently had to change the label on one of its treatments for chemotherapy-induced nausea to include that one of its side effects was anaphylactic shock — a life-threatening allergic reaction.
Next up for the biggest losers was Clovis Oncology, another cancer treatment maker with a stock down big for no real reason, the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""There wasn't really anything particularly bad about the presentation,"" Cramer said. ""In fact, Clovis had a lot of good things going on for it, especially when it comes to treating ovarian cancer and solid tumors, yet it can't seem to get any credit from Wall Street. That's intriguing.""
 Others
 Shares of Incyte got hit hard after the conference, but the company didn't report any bad news. Cramer said the real problem was that health care giant Celgene is buying Incyte's competitor, Impact Biomedicines, and the budding rivalry pushed investors out of Incyte's stock.
Cramer was also keeping a hawk's eye on Allergan after a tough 2017 for the Botox maker. But even after the company gave Wall Street weaker-than-expected guidance, the stock still managed to rally.
""CEO Brent Saunders painted a very compelling longer-term vision of the company's future in his presentation. Suddenly, Allergan seems to be getting traction again,"" Cramer said. ""We just need to hear something that gives investors a reason to buy the stock beyond the fact that it's cheap.""
The stock of Intuitive Surgical, the biotech behind the innovative da Vinci surgical robot, is also surging after a positive earnings pre-announcement. Cramer said he would stick with that name.
 Final thoughts
 ""Here's the bottom line: we got a lot of good news from the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference last week, but if this confab showed us one thing, it's that you need to be very careful when you speculate in small-cap biotech stocks, because the difference between the biggest winners and the biggest losers is enormous,"" the ""Mad Money"" host concluded.

Grogan | CNBC
Jamie Dimon speaking at the 2017 Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Sept. 12, 2017.
 J.P. Morgan Chase announced plans to spend $20 billion over five years to raise hourly pay for a portion of its workforce, add jobs and open 400 branches in new U.S. locations.
 The bank says tax breaks, reduced regulation and an improved business climate have made it possible to make these changes, which also include adding 4,000 jobs and increasing its charitable giving.
Earlier this month, the bank reported fourth-quarter profit that beat expectations despite a $2.4 billion charge related to the tax cuts and a difficult trading environment for its investment bank.
 ""Having a healthy, strong company allows us to make these long-term, sustainable investments,"" said J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon in a statement Tuesday. ""We are excited about further investing in our outstanding workforce and expanding into new U.S. markets."" 
Several large U.S. companies have announced one-time bonuses, investments in jobs and facilities, and growth plans since the tax overhaul enacted in Washington late last year. 
J.P. Morgan has more than 252,000 employees, about half of whom work in its consumer and community banking group. It has a little more than 5,100 branches in 23 states.
Hourly wages for some 22,000 workers will rise to between $15 and $18 in more than 100 cities, the bank said. In New York, San Francisco, Boston and Jersey City, New Jersey, the increase will be at the highest end of that range. Employees are also each getting a $750 bonus later this month.
The branch expansion, which includes 3,000 jobs, will target 15 to 20 new markets in several new states over five years, the bank said. Chase has branches throughout the U.S. but some pockets where it currently does not operate include Washington, D.C., Boston and Philadelphia. Adding 400 locations will boost the number of branches by nearly 8 percent.
The bank also says it will increase small business lending 20 percent, to $4 billion, over three years.

 JP Morgan says iPhone X orders are getting slashed, and Apple's shares are moving down on the news   
 6:06  PM ET Tue, 23 Jan 2018 |  00:39 
 A report projecting weak iPhone X orders temporarily trimmed some of Apple's stock growth on Tuesday.
 J.P. Morgan analyst Narci Chang wrote in a research note that ""high-end smartphones are clearly hitting a plateau this year."" The note went on to predict that manufacturing of the iPhone X — the latest flagship phone — might be down 50 percent between the December and March quarters. 
Shares remained up for the day in afternoon trading, hovering around $178 after a slight dip.
 Chang's report comes as some skepticism has clouded Apple's usually-sunny outlook. In Taiwanese media and among some supply chain analysts, reports have indicated that Apple might be scaling back on its iPhone X production plans. Some Wall Street analysts have also weighed in, saying the handset's nearly $1,000 price tag might be accelerating a slump caused by the saturation of the smartphone market.
Others are more optimistic. Analysts at Canalys estimate that at 29 million units in the fourth quarter, the iPhone X was the world's best-shipping smartphone during the holidays — even if Wall Street doesn't feel that volume is up to snuff. 
It's hard to know for sure whether demand is meeting expectations or if there's another cause behind the supply chain reports. Apple is notoriously secretive and has high expectations that manufacturers stay on the cutting edge, maintaining flexibility for design tweaks. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about J.P. Morgan's note.

Liam Griffin, CEO of Skyworks Solutions
 J.P. Morgan is seeing more evidence Apple iPhone demand is deteriorating, predicting weaker than expected sales results for the smartphone maker's suppliers this year.
On Tuesday ""our research colleagues in Asia reduced their estimates for EMS [electronics manufacturing service] builds for Apple iPhones for the March and June quarters of 2018,"" analyst Bill Peterson wrote in a note to clients Wednesday entitled ""Trimming Estimates on Smartphone Demand Weakness.""
 ""Taking into account our new expectations for smartphone demand, we take down our March quarter, June quarter and full year estimates for wireless companies under coverage.""

 Peterson noted the firm's Asian supply chain analysts lowered their iPhone production forecasts to 55 million from 60 million for the March quarter and to 45 million from 50 million for the June quarter.
The suppliers' ""non-mobile business fundamentals remain strong, but not enough to overcome weakening Apple demand,"" he wrote.
As a result, the analyst reduced his 2018 sales forecast for Skyworks Solutions to $4.11 billion from $4.24 billion. The Wall Street consensus is $4.13 billion.
He also lowered his 2018 sales forecast for Knowles to $772 million from $779 million compared to the Street's expectation of $798 million.
Peterson reaffirmed his neutral ratings for Skyworks and Knowles.
Skyworks manufactures radio frequency semiconductors, which enable smartphones to communicate with wireless networks. Apple represented nearly 40 percent of the company's fiscal 2016 sales, according to the analyst.
Knowles makes audio microphones for smartphones and other consumer electronics products.
Skyworks shares traded roughly even Wednesday, while Knowles stock dropped 1.5 percent.

 J.P. Morgan CEO Dimon will stay on for 5 more years   
 5:01  PM ET Mon, 29 Jan 2018 |  00:19 
 J.P. Morgan Chase's chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, will stay in that role for another five years, the bank said Monday, though it named two lieutenants to a co-president job.
 Daniel Pinto, 55, and Gordon Smith, 59, will start their new roles as co-presidents and co-chief operating officers on Tuesday, reporting to Dimon. They are, respectively, the CEOs of J.P. Morgan's corporate and investment bank and its consumer bank. 
J.P. Morgan's board and Dimon agreed that Dimon, 61, would stay at the bank, the statement said. But the promotions of the two executives ""reflect the enormous contributions"" they have made. They will continue to function in their current jobs while working with Dimon to ""drive critical firmwide opportunities,"" the statement said.
 Dimon is one of banking's longer-running CEOs, taking on the title of chief executive officer at the end of 2005 and chairman a year later. During his tenure as CEO, J.P. Morgan's stock has more than doubled to $116.20 from $48.07.
But his history at the helm has had its share of drama. J.P. Morgan came through the financial crisis relatively unscathed having snapped up a faltering Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual but later got tripped up in a trading debacle that came to be known as the London Whale. Dimon's tenure at the top rivals that of fellow CEO Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, both of whom have been in charge of their companies for more than a decade.
The average tenure of a S&P 500 CEO is four years. 
Pinto and Smith take on the role as heirs apparent after a wave of would-be successors and Dimon protegees have departed over the last few years, many going on to run other financial companies. Last fall, Dimon said the next CEO of J.P. Morgan would be coming from inside its executive ranks, though he arrived by way of a merger in 2004. He has said the running joke inside the bank was that he would stay for ""another five years.""

Jeff Bezos, Amazon
 Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan Chase have much to gain from their landmark health-care partnership, according to one Wall Street firm.
 The three companies revealed Tuesday a plan to partner on ways to cut health-care costs and improve services for their U.S. employees. The firms will launch an independent outfit initially targeting technology solutions, with the intention of being an umbrella firm that would be ""free from profit-making incentives.""
""Initial details are minimal although we view this as a long-term opportunity for these major employers to drive down the rate of increase of healthcare costs and therefore improve their bottom lines,"" Barclays research team wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
 Insurance analyst Jay Gelb said Berkshire Hathaway could save a lot of money due to the size of its workforce — 367,000 — and ability to consolidate coverage.
Internet analyst Ross Sandler expressed admiration for Amazon's technology capabilities and track record of disruption.
""Generally, we don't view the consortium approach as the right one … but we are never dismissive of anything disruptive that Amazon is involved in,"" he wrote. ""Amazon arguably has the best technical abilities of any company we cover, hence this is a development we will be watching closely.""
Bank analyst Jason Goldberg said J.P. Morgan will be able to contribute its industry expertise to the project.
""We believe JPM can help this consortium tackle payment related issues, leveraging its technology in the space,"" he wrote.
Goldberg said the bank could offer such innovative features as real-time balances, plan information and mobile payments.

 4:01  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  01:23 
 Three of the country's most powerful companies coming together to use technology to improve the health-care system — and lower the system's costs along the way — sounds like a great idea.
 But turning that idea into reality will be tough, experts said Tuesday.
Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan Chase announced Tuesday that they're banding together to create a company geared toward reducing health-care costs and improving services for U.S. employees.
 But the trio was light on the details beyond saying the new independent company's initial focus would be on developing ""technology solutions"" and that the firm would be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""
""The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,"" Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett said in a statement. ""Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable. Rather, we share the belief that putting our collective resources behind the country's best talent can, in time, check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.""
Gregg Slager, group leader of Ernst & Young's global health transaction advisory services division, said the three companies' desire to control health costs makes sense, given the fact that those costs are increasing, along with the patients' direct responsibility for health bills. But banding together may not be sufficient to change the health-care system's costliest components.
Health spending equals 18 percent of the nation's gross domestic product and is expected to reach 20 percent by 2025. The bulk of health-care expenses are hospitals and physicians, according to National Health Expenditure data compiled by Evercore ISI.
Evercore health-care analyst Ross Muken told CNBC that bending the overall health-cost curve ""isn't about controlling drug prices, modernizing the supply chain or improving devices.""
""Those are all relatively small parts of spending and some of those parts are deflationary already,"" Muken said. ""This is about getting to the guts of the system and where the inefficiency lies, which is physicians and hospitals."" 
In a note to clients published Tuesday, Muken said the stated mission of the companies' venture ""seems remarkably well placed as the government has failed at managing costs in healthcare for decades.""
""However, despite all the money and brain power likely devoted to what is going to be a seemingly [not-for-profit] effort the challenge here is massive. The reality is that a majority of the costs in the system sit within organizations that are difficult to reform and currently borderline profitable (providers),"" he said.
""Furthermore, trying to tackle physician compensation also seems like a heroic effort and one that is likely to cause massive uproar, particularly amongst the senior population.""
 Experts noted that one way employers have tried to address their health costs is by narrowing networks of medical providers covered by insurance plans, limiting which doctors, hospitals and labs patients can go to for care without paying significantly more out of pocket.
This new partnership could possibly create a new care network that steers people away from expensive sites of care when it's unnecessary, said Tim Van Biesen, a partner in Bain & Company's health-care practice.
One possibility is Amazon creating a platform that can direct patients to lower-cost options such as telemedicine or walk-in retail clinics. But whether that and other hypothetical steps taken by the three companies will result in markedly lower overall costs is still unknown.
Also, the trio is not the first group of outsiders to try to disrupt the health-care space. 
""This industry has seen some big companies try and change and exit as quickly as they came in,"" said Vaughn Kauffman, U.S. health services and new entrants advisory leader at PwC.
The new joint venture ""could be disruptive"" and put competitive pressure on pharmacy giants CVS and Walgreens and pharmacy benefit managers, said Mickey Chadha, a vice president at Moody's. But he added that the regulatory burden around every aspect of health care puts ""any new entrant in the space at a huge disadvantage, and companies like CVS, Walgreens, United Healthcare, Aetna and Express Scripts already have large scale, which allows for better vendor and drug manufacturer contracting and the ability to serve national clients.""
Experts have anticipated more deals and vertical integration in the wake of CVS announcing its intention to buy Aetna. That deal ""is even more compelling as a more coordinated approach to medical care is necessary to lower the overall health-care costs for consumers,"" Chadha said.
But Craig Garthwaite, director of the health enterprise management program at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said the thin amount of detail in the press release announcing the companies' venture does not give much reason to believe it will result in radical change in health costs.
""While we don't know their business plan, there's not a lot of optimism their press release generates given it's just retreading a lot of buzzwords given by people who don't really think about how to lower costs and improve quality of health-care,"" Garthwaite said. 
Gary Claxton, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the biggest driver of health costs is the money spent on sick and very sick people.
""It's not clear what private payers can do"" to drive down those costs, Claxton said, referring to insurance plans such as those offered by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, J.P. Morgan Chase and other businesses, as opposed to large publicly provided health coverage systems such as Medicare and Medicaid.
Claxton said that once a patient is undergoing treatment for their condition, costs can quickly pile up without the patient themselves having the time or the inclination to shop around for a better price, particularly when their health plan is picking much of the cost.
""If you're in cancer treatment or your kid's in cancer treatment, are you looking to save the next marginal dollar?"" Claxton asked. ""No.""
The relatively high cost of the American health-care system — which is much higher than that in other wealthy countries — makes it an attractive target for companies that believe they can save money by finding efficiencies and doing business differently than it has been done in the past, said Claxton.
There have been prior initiatives by non-health-care companies to band together regionally to try to lower their combined health costs. Some have had ""modest success,"" at best, Claxton said. However, none of them lowered their costs so dramatically that their model was adopted on a broad scale.
A new entrant trying to disrupt health-care costs faces a system that has already seen large-scale consolidation across different subsectors of the industry — including insurers, hospitals and drug companies — that will make squeezing out extra dollars in savings more difficult, Claxton said. And in the areas where big savings might be possible, there is often a reluctance to take the steps necessary to achieve those savings.
""We're not in the business of saying, 'We don't want new drugs developed,'"" Claxton said.
He also cited the case of one CEO he had heard of who was told his company's health plan could save $1 million annually by cutting out a local hospital from the network of providers covered by the plan.
Despite the fact that the area where the company was located did not lack for other hospitals, Claxton said, the CEO rejected the idea out of hand.

 Don't count insurers out on new Amazon, Berkshire and JP Morgan health-care plan   
 8:01  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  02:22 
 Calling health-care costs a hungry tapeworm on the economy, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan say they are joining forces to try to simplify their employee benefits using technology make for a better health-care experience and to drive down costs.
 The news hit like a shot across the bow of health insurers, sending shares of Cigna, Anthem, UnitedHealth and Aetna tumbling. Pharmacy benefit management firms Express Scripts and CVS Health also fell on the news.
""I think particularly with Amazon in play, it reflects an almost evangelical faith people have that they can disrupt established business problems in the way that they've done in many other industries,"" said Niall Brennan, president of the Health Care Cost Institute, while cautioning that the market may have overreacted.
 ""Employers have been trying and struggling to do this for 20, 30 or more years with ... unfortunately, limited success,"" he said. ""I really applaud it and I couldn't be more supportive, but we really need to see a lot more details beyond a press release.""
What could make this effort different from other employer cost-cutting initiatives is that the firms are coming together to form a not-for-profit company to try to leverage the companies' market power; combined the trio have more than half a million U.S. employees.
The question is whether the venture will try to do that by knocking out the middlemen who negotiate hospital networks and prices, and pharmacy benefit contracts with drugmakers.
""I think that those who are selling their shares in health-care stocks are reading this all wrong,"" said Jim Klein, American Benefits Council president. ""The middlemen here have an interest that is aligned with employers. They are the intermediaries with the health-care providers. The main problem with health care these days ... is that cost and quality are not aligned.""
A number of health-care firms hailed the news, saying they want to be on board.
Aetna and CVS — which have announced a $69 billion deal to merge their insurance and pharmacy into an integrated health clinic service — both said they welcome the chance to help the firms with the new venture.
""There is an unmet consumer need in health care. Individuals and families want a simple, affordable and high-quality experience that helps them stay well,"" said Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini in a statement, adding ""I am encouraged to see other companies working toward the same goal.""
Pharmacy benefit firm Express Scripts said in a statement, ""Today's announcement by Amazon, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Berkshire Hathaway is clear recognition that the healthcare system needs to continue to create and deliver meaningful value to payers and patients … We look forward to hearing more about this new initiative and how we can work together to improve health care for everyone.""
Until now the fear has been that Amazon would enter health care as a competitor to these services, but combining with other employers would still put the tech giant in a position to exert tremendous pricing pressure on health care.
""The best results that we've seen have come from jumbo employer efforts — from them either teaming together or doing pilot projects on their own to prove that something is a good idea and then everybody else gets in line and adopts similar approaches,"" said Tracy Watts, senior partner at benefit consulting firm Mercer.
It's not clear how soon Amazon, Berkshire and J.P. Morgan's new health-care venture would launch, but with tech giants like Apple and Google also increasingly focused on health-care, current players in the industry have to brace for continuing disruption.
""This puts the market on notice,"" said Watts.

 How to play the Amazon-Berkshire-JP Morgan health care move   
 7:18  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  01:00 
 When Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan announced a partnership to cut costs and improve services across the health care industry, CNBC's Jim Cramer had to weigh in.
 The joint venture, organized by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and J.P. Morgan's Jamie Dimon, will aim to be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints,"" the companies said on Tuesday.
""It's bad enough that the most important man in finance, the most important man in retail and the best investor alive are teaming up to tackle the problems of our health care system, but even worse for the industry, they're doing it for free,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""It is very hard to compete with someone who doesn't care about turning a profit.""
 The initiative elevates the discussion around rising health care costs in the United States, which Cramer said the three titans view as ""the ultimate tax on the system.""
In May 2017, Buffett said that in 50 years, health care has gone from being 5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) to 17 percent with few solutions in sight to curb surging costs.
""Now that's going to change,"" Cramer said. ""Now there is something on the horizon, a company of his own creation with the most technologically savvy provider of what people want and the smartest banker of our time.""
The ""Mad Money"" host also noted the analyst community's eerily calm reaction to the deal. No analyst covering health care retailers like CVS or in-the-line-of-fire middlemen like Express Scripts wants to come out and slash the estimates for those companies right away, he said.
""But I bet the analysts who actually cover Jeff, Jamie and Warren's companies — Amazon, J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway — would view this coalition with a very different, awestruck attitude. I'll tell you, if these guys were coming after my business, I'd be terrified,"" Cramer said.
Some analysts were able to compose sound defenses, including that UnitedHealth's Optum service is already tackling costs and that the middlemen save costs by buying as a group.
But Cramer came back with some retorts: the incumbent companies are still not as digitally savvy as this new player will be, and their teams of government lobbyists won't be of any use when it comes to Bezos, Buffett or Dimon.
What does that mean for investors? Cramer's answer was somewhat complicated, particularly for investors who can't wait to get in on the action.
Even leading players like UnitedHealth aren't safe from being in the ""penalty box"" for some time, he said.
""You need a health care company that's survived every onslaught imaginable,"" Cramer said. ""You need a road warrior with a stock that you'll want to load up on into weakness if Amazon talks about this effort on its Thursday night conference call, or the non-profit comes up with a name or a chief executive.""
Investors also need a stock that is cheap with positive prospects that are supported by the technicals, the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""In short, you need Centene,"" he said. ""Centene's an expert at providing its clients with high-quality care at the lowest possible costs, and yet it's been making its shareholders a fortune.""
Centene, a large, enterprise-facing provider of Medicare and Medicaid, was even blessed by technician Marc Chaikin as one of the best health care stocks on Monday, Cramer added.
Still, Cramer maintained that buyers should time their investments wisely.
""I don't like to enter a blast zone on the first day of a sell-off, especially when there are still plenty of stocks outside the blast zone that have come down,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""So if you want health care exposure, I suggest waiting until the group's a little less radioactive. But if you just can't resist, if you need to pick one up this week, I'd say buy Centene.""

 The drop in health insurance stocks after the landmark partnership announcement by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan Chase is a buying opportunity, according to one Wall Street firm.
 The three companies announced a partnershipon Tuesday to devise ways to cut health-care costs and improve services for their 1.1 million employees. The firms will launch an independent outfit initially targeting technology solutions, with the intention to be an umbrella firm that would be ""free from profit-making incentives. 
""While we do not want to discount the clout that these entities potentially bring to the table, it is entirely too early to cede victory to the yet unnamed venture,"" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper wrote in a client note entitled ""Amazon/Berkshire/JPM Joining Forces; More Bark than Bite at this Point.""
 UnitedHealth Group dropped 3 percent by midday. Anthem was off by 5 percent, Aetna fell by 3 percent, Centene was 1.5 percent lower.
The analyst expressed doubt on the venture due to the lack of industry management experience of the executives put in charge of the new organization such as Berkshire's Todd Combs, a former hedge fund manager.
""This is not a new concept within the healthcare benefits world. These companies are probably self insured and already use a wide range of solutions to administer benefit solutions to their employees,"" Halper wrote in an email to CNBC. ""We do not believe this represents a new competitive threat to the managed care companies at this juncture.""
The analyst reiterated his overweight ratings for Anthem, United Health and Centene.

 The S&P 500 shed 4.1 percent, marking its biggest one-day sell-off since August 2011. The Dow Jones industrial average pulled back 1,175.21 points. Both indexes erased their gains for 2018.
This pullback comes after a rip-roaring start to the year for stocks. The Dow and S&P 500 notched all-time highs as well as sharp gains for January.
But concerns of rising inflation have recently pushed interest rates to multi-year highs, sending jitters down Wall Street. Investors worried that higher inflation would lead the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster than the market expects. Those concerns sent stocks into their current tailspin.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. note yield reached 2.88 percent overnight, but dropped back to 2.7 percent as investors looked for shelter from the equity market's onslaught.
Despite all of this, ""we want to point out the massive divergence between strong market fundamentals and equity price action over the past few days,"" Kolanovic said. ""The large market decline over the past few days will likely draw fundamental investors and even trigger pension fund rebalances (those that rebalance on weight thresholds).""
""We also want to highlight a strong probability of policy makers stepping in to calm the market,"" he said.

 The market's wild roller-coaster ride may have come to an end, J.P. Morgan strategist Marko Kolanovic said. 
 ""We think the worst is over,"" Kolanovic said of the two-day sell-offs that started during Friday's session. ""Some volatility will persist. It's not just going to disappear in one day, but we think this is the time to start getting into the market."" 
The widely followed analyst pointed out that fundamentals on both the corporate and micro side didn't change that much. Instead, the rapid volatility was ""more of a technical market glitch,"" said Kolanovic, J.P. Morgan's global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy.
 ""It will have some sort of repercussions for volatility,"" he said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money."" ""Meaning, volatility is going to stay a little bit elevated, but we think it's a time to start stepping into the market. Probably an opportunity to buy.""  
Volatility continued in the stock market on Monday after rising interest rates ignited panic among investors. By the end of day Monday, the S&P 500 had fallen 4.1 percent — the biggest single-day sell-off since August 2011. The Dow Jones industrial average also took a hit, briefly falling below 1,500 points in the afternoon. By the end of trading day the Dow had declined 1,175.21 points to 24,345.75. Both indexes' gains in January were wiped out earlier this week. 
But stocks rebounded after opening low Tuesday. By the end of the day, the Dow was 567.02 points higher, closing at 24,912.77. The S&P 500 was also up 2,695.14 points. 
The technical glitch likely ""overwhelmed electronic market makers,"" Kolanovic said. While some aftershocks are expected, he said, the biggest punch to the market has likely passed. 
""I think these kind of outflows could persist for a week or two,"" said the analyst. ""But we don't think the outflows are strong enough to push the market, further crash the market.""

 CVS Health chairman: Aetna gives us additional capability

 The joint foray by Amazon, J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway into health care isn't the newest idea, it's just the most recent, CVS Health's chairman says.

Morgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett ignited excitement for what innovation they could bring to what's often considered a bloated industry. 
But industry experts have cautioned people to temper their excitement, especially since other companies have tried — and failed — similar ideas before. About 40 major companies, including names like American Express and Macy's, have joined the Health Transformation Alliance to try to lower costs. 
 ""I think the Buffett, Bezos, Dimon thing is 'we're mad as hell and not going to take it anymore,'"" CVS Health's Nonexecutive Chairman David Dorman told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. ""How they actually do it, the closer you get you realize that almost 60 percent of the cost is in the providers, so doctors and hospitals. That's very disaggregated.""
Dorman thinks it will be a ""very difficult effort"" since the three can't control the decisions their employees make or those of their workers' doctors. 
One way CVS is trying to lower provider costs is by adding walk-in medical clinics at more of its retail locations. The company currently has more than 1,100 MinuteClinics and 9,800 physical locations. 
CVS is trying to leverage those physical locations with a proposed $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna. They want to create an integrated health system that combines pharmacy and health benefits while delivering preventive care services through the retail clinics.
""So CVS with 10,000 (stores) — a store within three miles of 80 percent of the population, a clinic in the store combining with Aetna — we think we can bring more capabilities to bear at the local level and serve national organizations and small organizations, as well.""
The CVBS-Aetna deal is expected to close in the second half of the year.
