 Emotionality might not be the first trait to come to mind when thinking about what makes a CEO so successful. However, if you listen to Nadella speak before an audience of Microsoft employees, you'll notice how he taps into his own confidence and shares that emotion with others. Inspiring your workers can be key to success. 
But that's not all: Nadella also appeared highly in touch with his own feelings in a video for The Wall Street Journal. When the interviewer asked, ""Who's been the biggest influence on you?"" Nadella, who up until that point has answered a range of questions with humor, looked sincerely moved. His eyes began to water slightly and he paused before answering, ""My parents.""
 He also revealed in the interview that his mother was a drama professor, so perhaps he learned early on the power of using your heart as well as your head.
For the study, Paysa used data from IBM's supercomputer Watson to determine Nadella's defining characteristics, along with those of other tech leaders, to figure out what makes him so successful.

 According to the study,  Nadella's top five traits are:
 Emotionality Intellect Cooperation Immoderation Melancholy 
 This is Nadella's personality as mapped out by Paysa:
 Other traits Nadella apparently possesses include excitement-seeking, self-efficacy, gregariousness and self-discipline.
Paysa performed a similar analysis of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's personality and found that his top trait is intellect, which ranks high for Nadella, too. The firm also analyzed data on Tesla's Elon Musk, which ranked intellect as his top personality trait.
To arrive at these results, Paysa ""gathered speeches, essays, books, the transcripts of interviews and other forms of communication produced by those highlighted above."" It put over 2,500 words ""through the Watson Personality Insights API.""

Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft, speaks during a Microsoft launch event to introduce the new Microsoft Surface laptop and Windows 10 S operating system, May 2, 2017 in New York City.
 Microsoft plans to announce on Tuesday a new campaign to try to ""eliminate"" the gap in high-speed internet access in the country's hardest-to-reach areas — an effort called the Rural Airband Initiative, which will set an ambitious target of bringing better broadband to two million Americans within the next five years.
The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant plans to start its efforts in 12 states, offering seed money — Microsoft wouldn't specify the amount — to local telecom providers that are trying to improve internet access through means like ""white spaces,"" which are the invisible, wireless radio airwaves that aren't already owned by broadcasters.
More from Recode:The Trump administration is delaying a key program for foreign entrepreneursWatch Amazon wreak stock-price havoc this month on competitors of all stripesBest Buy lost $1 billion in value on the news of Amazon's Geek Squad competitor
 From Microsoft point of view, this approach — aimed at delivering speedy wireless internet — is the best way to improve connectivity in parts of the country that broadband providers long have ignored, given the prohibitive costs of building and sustaining networks there. By Microsoft's count, more than 23 million Americans in rural areas currently lack high-speed internet access, despite billions of dollars in federal investment.
But the company emphasized that it is not looking to become a telecom provider — it's only providing capital to local firms — and does not seek to profit from the endeavor. Through revenue-sharing agreements, Microsoft instead plans to invest any money it raises in additional projects in other states where internet access is lacking.
Microsoft president Brad Smith is slated to unveil the project during a speech in Washington, D.C., later on Tuesday. He declined to be interviewed for this story.
Microsoft faces a daunting task in bridging the country's digital divide.
For one thing, these ""white spaces"" aren't available in every market in the United States. Rather, Microsoft wants the Federal Communications Commission to reserve more of that spectrum for unlicensed use in the coming months. But the idea has been met with stiff opposition from broadcasters, which generally have to pay to obtain that spectrum from the U.S. government.
Nor are ""white spaces"" some panacea for the country's broadband ills: Even Microsoft acknowledges in its announcement that other technologies, like internet delivered by satellite, are necessary to improve connectivity in the country's most remote regions. At the moment, Microsoft has not announced any specific investments in that technology.
For now, the initial targets are 12 states: Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, a spokesman told Recode. In Virginia, Microsoft previously announced a partnership with a local network to provide free broadband in two communities where 50 percent of students have no internet connectivity.
Through its philanthropic organization, Microsoft also plans to work with groups like the National 4-H Council, a youth-development effort, as the tech giant tries to boost digital literacy training.
Meanwhile, Microsoft will set about lobbying in Washington, D.C., seeking the release of more ""white spaces"" as well as new federal investments in U.S. broadband. The tech company has specifically called for government funding on a ""matching basis"" with private sector dollars, a position that aligns closely with the Trump administration, where senior officials have mulled a major infrastructure package — valued at $1 trillion — that would rely heavily on public-private partnerships.

 This free app is helping the visually impaired   
 8:36  AM ET Tue, 18 July 2017 |  01:36 
 Microsoft is putting its artificial intelligence technology to work to help the visually impaired.
 The company said on Wednesday that it's releasing an iOS app called Seeing AI that uses an iPhone's camera to tell people about objects in front of them. The app shows off Microsoft's current capabilities in AI, while also addressing a group that the technology industry too often ignores.
Microsoft first revealed the technology to an audience of developers last year, but at the time it was only shown as working on smart glasses. Now anyone with an iPhone or iPad can try it.
 Microsoft isn't saying whether Seeing AI will become available on Android. Still, its arrival on iOS is the latest example of Microsoft, under CEO Satya Nadella, embracing third-party platforms.
For example, Microsoft brought its SQL Server database software to Linux, and it has ported Office apps to the iPad. Most recently it added support for Apple's MacBook Pro Touch Bar in Office apps.
Microsoft also said it will be developing a set of design guidelines for AI-infused features in products to ensure a greater degree of transparency and to emphasize ethics. The announcement comes two days after Google introduced a new research initiative around improving the design of its own AI systems for users, professionals and researchers. 
Additionally, Microsoft is rejiggering staffers within the artificial intelligence and research group that it formed in September. Under the leadership of Eric Horvitz, the new Microsoft Research AI program is designed to bring together around 100 people who specialize in different technologies categorized under AI, instead of having them spread out in Microsoft AI and Research, which includes around 6,000 people, a Microsoft spokesman said.

 Steve Ballmer sees how investors 'could be a little worried' about a stock bubble   
 8:32  AM ET Fri, 14 July 2017 |  01:42 
 Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said Friday he can see why investors could be worried the stock market is in a bubble.
 ""Are we in a market bubble or not? I don't know. I'm silent on it. Where multiples are, etc., you could be a little worried,"" Ballmer said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
""I killed myself in the late '90s when I said the stock market was overdone and we got a hiccup down the next day,"" he said.
 Since the election, as of Thursday's close, the Dow Jones industrial average has surged more than 17 percent, the S&P 500 has gained 14 percent and the Nasdaq composite has risen 20 percent.
When asked whether President Donald Trump's pro-business policies have contributed to the market's gains, he said: ""I have no idea.""

Steve Ballmer
 Billionaire Steve Ballmer said Friday that government data show it's not clear whether tax policy will have an impact on business investment.
 Ballmer, founder of a nonpartisan database for government statistics, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that his USAFacts group looked at capital investment and research and development. 
""No matter what tax policy we've seen, it more or less increases linearly over time. It does not spike up. It does not spike down,"" he said. ""I won't draw a conclusion, but the question is can that be really stimulated?""
 The LA Clippers owner and former Microsoft CEO spoke after the Office of Management and Budget director talked about the Trump administration's plan to achieve sustained economic growth.
Mick Mulvaney wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday that the U.S. can achieve 3 percent GDP growth by cutting taxes, reforming welfare programs, investing in infrastructure, initiating new trade deals, and curbing government spending, among other things.
A major tax overhaul was a hallmark of Trump's campaign, and some analysts say its pending arrival is partly the reason for the stock market's rise.
As of Thursday's close, the Dow Jones industrial average has surged more than 17 percent, the S&P 500 has gained 14 percent and the Nasdaq composite has risen 20 percent since the election.
On Thursday, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen told Congress she doesn't believe Trump's plan will be enough to achieve that growth.

 Credit Suisse raised its Microsoft price forecast and call the stock a top pick into earnings because of expectations its cloud business will grow faster than Wall Street currently expects.
 Results from a recent Credit Suisse survey show that Microsoft's cloud platform Azure is enjoying more popularity over its competitors.
""Our Outperform thesis on MSFT shares is centered on what we view as significant earnings power potential over the next few years,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Michael Nemeroff on Monday.

Baidu driverless cars in test run during the 3rd World Internet Conference (WIC) on November 17, 2016 in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province of China.
 Microsoft is throwing the weight of its Azure cloud infrastructure behind Baidu's open source autonomous driving project, Apollo, the companies announced Tuesday. 
 Baidu first revealed details about the initiative, named after the historic lunar landing program, in April: It is an open platform that provides cloud infrastructure, open software stack and other services that are able to support major features and functions of an autonomous car.
Companies using the Apollo platform for their self-driving vehicle projects can use Microsoft's Azure cloud services to securely scale outside China.
 ""Today's vehicles already have an impressive level of sophistication when it comes to their ability to capture data,"" Kevin Dallas, corporate vice president at Microsoft, said in a prepared statement.
He added, ""By applying our global cloud AI, machine learning, and deep neural network capabilities to that data, we can accelerate the work already being done to make autonomous vehicles safer."" 
The autonomous vehicle space has been growing in recent years, with traditional automakers and prominent tech names working on various projects. Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent Alphabet, is considered one of the leading players in this space, ahead of names like Ford, Nissan and Tesla. 
Last year, consulting firm McKinsey & Company said in a report that up to 15 percent of new cars sold in 2030 could potentially be fully autonomous. 
Earlier this month, Baidu said more than 50 groups have signed on to build and improve the Apollo platform, including top Chinese car makers Chery Auto, Great Wall Motors and Changan Automobile. Other notable stakeholders include ride-sharing company Grab, global navigation and mapping service provider TomTom, suppliers Bosch and Continental as well as Ford and Intel.

 Microsoft is using the sudden, huge popularity of an unfinished game to get an edge on Sony   
 4:51  PM ET Wed, 19 July 2017 |  00:49 
 You won't find ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" on any of The NPD Group's monthly video game sales charts. It's not available at GameStop. And it, officially, won't be finished until the end of the year. (In fact, it's quite buggy and has fairly shoddy graphics.)
 But that hasn't stopped the online action game from selling nearly 5 million copies and making over $100 million in revenue for its South Korean maker, Bluehole, in the past four months.
And it hasn't stopped Microsoft from using the game's massive and sudden popularity to try to get an edge over its perennial rival, Sony.
 ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" has amassed those sales and that enviable player base via the Steam digital distribution system. Taking a page from the successful playbook of ""Minecraft"" and other big independent titles, it released a playable, but incomplete, version of the game via Steam's ""Early Access"" program, charging $30 per copy.
Lots of developers do that, usually to help fund the creation of their games, but few see their efforts go as viral as ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" has. Fans love it — and tell their friends, who buy a copy and further spread the word. Even celebrities, such as Terry Crews, are vocal about their love of the game.
To put the popularity of ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" into perspective, it 
recently topped
 Take-Two Interactive Software's ""Grand Theft Auto V"" for peak number of concurrent users — with 382,561 people playing at once versus 360,761 playing ""GTA"" in April 2015.
 So what makes the game so popular?
""They've differentiated the multiplayer experience from 'Call of Duty,'"" says Mike Hickey of Benchmark. ""It's fresh and new and an exciting way to play.""
It works like this: As many as 100 players parachute onto an island and begin scavenging for weapons and equipment to take out their opponents. As the match goes on, the size of the game's world shrinks, forcing players to battle each other, rather than hiding and winning the game without effort. The last player or team standing wins.
It's fast-paced and a lot of fun, even for beginners, since every round offers a reset. And its popularity has caught the eye of larger publishers.
And this is where Microsoft comes in. In June, the company said ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" would be coming to its Xbox One console. This is not happening for Sony's PlayStation 4 — at least for now — since Microsoft has a limited exclusivity deal with the company. It's unclear how long that deal lasts, or whether Sony will pursue a partnership with the game's developer once that exclusivity ends. (Sony did not respond to a request for comment.)
While the Xbox hasn't sold nearly as many units as PlayStation this generation, there's still a sizable new audience that will be exposed to the game later this year. And by going multiplatform, ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" could become a threat to larger publishers' titles.
""It could very well be that publishers will have to think about acquiring [Bluehole] or altering how they make games,"" says Joost van Dreunen, CEO of SuperData.
There is some precedent for a big indie title being swallowed by a larger publisher. Microsoft, in 2014, bought ""Minecraft"" for $2.5 billion — though that game appealed far beyond the core gamer and had been around for five years.
Before any talk of a buyout happens, though, ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"" will have to prove it has longevity. While it's certainly off to a roaring start, the key to ensuring long-term customer engagement is regularly offering updates to the game (something Take-Two has successfully done with ""Grand Theft Auto Online."")
That said, Bluehole has effectively used the Early Access model to talk with its community and make regular iterations to the game to increase engagement. (Microsoft has a similar program for console games called Game Preview.)
Those listening skills and the ability to incorporate player requests into the development process while staying true to the developer's own vision has been the key to the game's success, say analysts. With each pivot, ""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds'"" fan base has grown — and there's no reason to expect that will change anytime in the immediate future.

 Why this tech bellwether is a good buy for the long run   
 4:49  PM ET Wed, 19 July 2017 |  01:58 
 Ahead of Microsoft's quarterly earnings report due out on Thursday after the market close, one macro strategist is marking the stock as a buy.
 The legacy technology company has seen a strong long-term trend, said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management. Even if Microsoft sees a short-term decline here, it's still going to present a good buying opportunity as a good ""relative value bet,"" he said Wednesday.
""One of the key things to watch for is how successful Microsoft is going to be in the future in converting consumers to a subscription model. Generally, most of the analysts expect Microsoft to come in strong in this quarter, but we're going to be watching the numbers. And, the more important point here is that the longer-term trend for Microsoft is very positive,"" Schlossberg said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation,"" adding that the stock is quite cash-heavy and is still very undervalued relative to its peers.
 Bolstering Schlossberg's bullish outlook is the company's ability to evolve in recent years from a software enterprise business to one reliant on subscription revenue and cloud services.
""Instead of trying to capture revenue all the way up front, they made a very astute business decision to try to capture revenue every single year by locking customers in to their Office 365 product,"" he said.
Persuading consumers to upgrade to a subscription model for Office 365 services has been a weak spot for the company, though, Schlossberg said, as Google's suite of office tools could present competition.
""Microsoft appears to be a very strong trade still for the next several years as this business change continues to develop,"" Schlossberg said.
The stock was trading modestly higher on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of $3.03, according to FactSet estimates.

Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO
 Microsoft's collection of cloud apps for businesses have hit a new milestone. They now bring in more revenue than licenses for desktop Office apps and on-premises servers like Exchange.
 ""For the first time, Office 365 Commercial revenue surpassed revenue from our traditional licensing business,"" Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood said Thursday on the earnings call for the fourth quarter of the company's 2017 fiscal year.
The figure applies only to the quarter and does not include revenue for consumer subscriptions to Office 365, a spokeswoman told CNBC in an email.
 In the quarter Office 365 commercial revenue grew 43 percent, according to Microsoft's earnings report. That growth contributed partly to Microsoft's annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate, which hit $18.9 billion. 
""I feel very good,"" Hood said, about meeting the goal Microsoft set two years ago to reach $20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate.
Microsoft introduced Office 365 in 2010. Today commercial customers can get access to apps like Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and OneDrive. With certain subscription plans Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams, Yammer and other apps are available.

 Microsoft intelligent cloud revenue beats estimates   
 6:51  PM ET Thu, 20 July 2017 |  04:22 
 Microsoft stock rose by as much as 4 percent after the company reported its earnings for the fourth quarter of its 2017 fiscal year, which ended on June 30. The stock flattened out after the company offered guidance for the next quarter, however, before moving slightly higher again in premarket trading.
 The company beat analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue.
 EPS: Excluding certain items, 98 cents in earnings per share vs. 71 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: Excluding certain items, $24.7 billion vs. $24.27 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. 
 Azure revenue increased 97 percent year over year, and Azure's gross margin improved in the quarter, Microsoft said in its earnings statement. In the cloud business that Microsoft is so focused on these days, Alphabet with its G Suite and Google Cloud Platform, represents competition. Amazon is also a significant player with its market-leading Amazon Web Services public cloud. 
In its earnings statements Microsoft doesn't provide exact revenue for Azure, but the company does talk about Azure revenue under its commercial cloud heading, which also includes Dynamics 365 and Office 365 commercial plans. Microsoft's commercial cloud ""strength should continue as unit and pricing trends remain positive,"" Stifel analysts Brad Reback and Adam Borg noted earlier this week, providing an estimate of an $18 billion annualized revenue run rate. In fact commercial cloud came in at a $18.9 billion revenue run rate, meaning that the figure has more than doubled in the past two years.

 Microsoft's Dynamics 365 revenue was up 74 percent, while Dynamics in total increased 7 percent. Commercial Office 365 revenue went up 43 percent.
LinkedIn contributed $1.1 billion in revenue to Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment, whose revenue jumped 21 percent.
Revenue growth in server products and cloud services revenue contributed to the 11 percent gain in Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment.
The More Personal Computing segment was the laggard of the bunch, dropping 2 percent. Phone revenue dropped by $361 million and Surface revenue went down 2 percent, but the division was buoyed by gains from Windows, games, and search ads. 
Bing growth was a factor in the 8 percent search ad revenue boost; Microsoft said search volume and revenue per search both went up. 
With the Surface revenue slide, Microsoft said it sold fewer units, but that factor was offset by the introduction of ""a higher mix of premium devices."" New Surface products include the Surface Laptop and revamped Surface Pro. ""I'm expecting an uptick in Surface the next quarter as Surface Laptop and Surface Pro become fully available across all channels and countries,"" analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy told CNBC in an email. 
Xbox hardware revenue fell 29 percent; Microsoft pointed to lower prices and a decline in the number of consoles it sold.
For the full fiscal year, Microsoft made $25.9 billion in non-GAAP net income, or $21.2 billion in GAAP net income. Non-GAAP revenue for the full fiscal year was $96.7 billion. 
 In terms of guidance, excluding corporate and other revenue, Microsoft expects to post $23.6-24.3 billion in revenue in the first quarter of its 2018 fiscal year, which ends on September 30, chief financial officer Amy Hood said on the company's earnings call. After Hood provided those numbers, Microsoft stock dropped in after-hours trading, falling to as much as 1.5 percent below the stock's $74.22 closing price.
Earlier this month, the company said it would lay off thousands of employees, primarily in sales, in an effort to boost its cloud business as it begins its 2018 fiscal year.
 Microsoft stock hit an all-time intra-day high of $74.30 today ahead of earnings. Microsoft stock has increased more than 18 percent since the beginning of the year.

9,2017-07-24,"Microsoft is considering killing the iconic Paint software after nearly 32 years  Microsoft is entering the war over A.I. chips  Crypto investors flock to a market where tech giants Amazon, Google and Facebook are absent  ","CNBC 
Microsoft Paint was first introduced in 1985.
 Microsoft is considering removing the iconic Paint application from an upcoming update of Windows 10 after nearly 32 years in existence. 
 In a list released by Microsoft, Paint has been labeled ""deprecated"", meaning it could be removed when the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update is released later this year.
Paint was introduced with the first version of Windows, called Windows 1.0 in November 1985. It was originally a licensed version of PC Paintbrush which was made by ZSoft Corporation.
 In the beginning, it supported 1-bit monochrome graphics, and it wasn't until Windows 98 that users could save images in the well-known JPEG file format.
Last year, Microsoft unveiled Paint 3D, a new version of the classic software. It is much more advanced, allowing users to create three-dimensional images. 
Other features going from the next Windows 10 update include Outlook Express and the reader app, which Microsoft said will be integrated into its Edge browser.
Paint holds a certain nostalgia with many Windows users despite never really having huge functionality versus other apps such as Adobe's Photoshop. But the simplicity was perhaps what made it so popular. 
The Fall update of Windows 10 does not have a release date yet, and it's not completely confirmed whether Paint will be axed. But the prospect of the death of Paint is already getting some users upset on social media.

Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft
 Microsoft on Sunday  disclosed that it's working on a new coprocessor for its next HoloLens augmented reality headset that will be dedicated to handling artificial intelligence workloads.
 The idea is that with this new chip inside the main ""Holographic Processing Unit,"" the next-generation HoloLens will be able to do things like recognize objects in the line of sight, but its battery won't be exhausted too quickly, because the main chip won't need to do the extra computing work.
""We really do need custom silicon to help power some of the scenarios and applications that we are building,"" as Microsoft's chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, told  Bloomberg.
 In the past few years, as AI has become trendy, many app makers have shunted the necessary underlying computations, like recognizing the words that people say, to servers in remote data centers. So chipmakers like Intel and Nvidia have begun adjusting their silicon accordingly, and Alphabet has even designed its own chips.
But for some applications, it's not desirable or realistic to expect a robust internet connection that can provide a backbone for those connections from a local mobile device to a cloud. Earlier this year a Google executive said he expects mobile device makers to come up with new processors for AI. And there are indications that Apple is preparing to unveil an AI chip for the iPhone.
Now it turns out Microsoft is also working on optimizing AI on lower-powered devices. The HoloLens is by no means today a mass-market device — sales were said to be in the thousands. But whatever the company learns from the affair could surely be valuable for the development of future products — although they probably won't be phones.
Microsoft worked with Cadence and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on the original special processor for the HoloLens, which worked with a standard onboard Intel chip. Cadence and Microsoft declined to comment. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

An image from Microsoft's blog in which it said that Paint will be available for free from the Windows Store.
 Microsoft is not killing off its Paint app in the next update of Windows 10, the company said late on Monday, after fears that the iconic software could be ditched.
 The U.S. technology company recently released a list which labeled Paint ""deprecated"", meaning it was considering removing the app when the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update gets released later this year.
Fans on social media decried the potential death of Paint, which has been in existence for 32 years. 
 But Microsoft released a blog post shortly after to clarify that Paint would not be completely removed, but instead made available via the Windows Store for free. 
""Today, we've seen an incredible outpouring of support and nostalgia around MS Paint. If there's anything we learned, it's that after 32 years, MS Paint has a lot of fans. It's been amazing to see so much love for our trusty old app,"" Megan Saunders, a general manager at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post on Monday.
""Amidst today's commentary around MS Paint we wanted to take this opportunity to set the record straight, clear up some confusion and share some good news: MS Paint is here to stay, it will just have a new home soon, in the Windows Store where it will be available for free.""

 1. ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" by Daniel Kahneman
 Written by psychologist Daniel Kahneman, winner of the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, the book focuses on why and how people make decisions, observations and decisions both good and bad, focusing on human biases.
""This book was a milestone to me,"" Medina tells CNBC Make It. After reading it, ""you'll never see the world in the same way again,"" he says.
 A post shared by UTSC | (@shekit) on Apr 2, 2017 at 10:46am PDT
 The key lesson, he says, is that ""To be successful, you really must think things through.""
Every young professional, he says, could benefit from reading Kahneman's bestseller because it makes readers aware of the biases and logical fallacies humans often make. 
""The more good decisions you make, and the less bad decisions you make, the more you're going to accumulate momentum in your career,"" Medina says.
 2. ""Mindset"" by Carol Dweck
 Carol Dweck, renowned Stanford University psychologist, pours more than a decade of research into motivation and success in her book ""Mindset."" 
The book outlines how the key differences between people who feel stuck — and often stay stuck — and those who feel motivated and excel.  
 A post shared by Rachel Victoria (@rachvictoria93) on Jun 12, 2017 at 11:41am PDT
 For Medina, success is all about growth, whether you're overcoming an obstacle, learning a valuable lesson or discovering a strength.
""Growth takes you to areas you haven't tried before,"" he says. ""You have to be exposed to things you have no experience with, but tell your mind you can succeed.""
The book taught him that if wanted to put in the hard work to become a tech employee, manager and then a leader, he had to prepare mentally.
""You really have to believe [in your goal], otherwise you won't be able to put your time into it.""

Satya Nadella speaking at the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 Microsoft on Wednesday is challenging Google's cloud computing business with a trendy new kind of cloud computing service that Google specializes in -- along with a super-cheap payment model that will be perfect for cutting-edge experimental uses.
 The Azure Container Instances tool will provide access to a container -- a virtual slice on a physical Microsoft server -- within seconds, Microsoft said, and the company will charge based on the number of seconds that a given container is being used, instead of by the minute or by the hour.
Containers, which have become trendy in the past few years, are considered a more efficient alternative to virtual machines.
 Microsoft has embraced the container format in its Windows Server software for corporate data centers, as well as in its Azure cloud, with services like the Azure Container Service and Azure Container Registry.
Now Microsoft is going deeper, with a focus on speed and simplicity.
""As the service directly exposes containers, there is no VM management you need to think about or higher-level cluster orchestration concepts to learn. It is simply your code, in a container, running in the cloud,"" Corey Sanders, head of product for Azure Compute at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post. 
The introduction of the product can be read as a challenge to Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, whose Google Container Engine is based on the Kubernetes open-source container cluster management software.

Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft
 When Microsoft unveiled the first Surface tablet five years ago, it was a spectacular failure.
At the time, the Apple iPhone was well on its way to conquering the technology industry, and the iPad appeared set to lead an even more devastating invasion of Microsoft's office-worker kingdom. Microsoft conceived of Surface, an innovative laptop-tablet hybrid, as a way to show off the versatility of its software. Windows machines, it argued, could work as phones, personal computers and tablets. And didn't everyone love Windows?
Nope.  Microsoft soon took a $900 million write-off for unsold Surfaces. Another effort to break into the hardware business, its acquisition of the limping phone-maker Nokia, dug a deeper river of red ink —  a $7.6 billion write-off. By the summer of 2015, Microsoft's hardware dreams looked crushed. Even today, the Xbox One, Microsoft's latest gaming console,  is losing to the  Sony  PlayStation 4.
 Still, Microsoft persisted — and today, the company is making the most visionary computers in the industry, if not the best machines, period. In the last two years, while Apple has focused mainly on mobile devices, Microsoft has put out a series of computers that reimagine the future of PCs in thrilling ways.
Yes, Apple loyalists, that's just my subjective view. And yes, Microsoft's latest financial results aren't exactly on my side here — the company announced last week that though its  cloud software business is growing rapidly, revenue for its Surface division  declined by 2 percent over the last year (because of changes it made in its launch schedule).
Microsoft, of course, makes most of its money from the PC business by licensing Windows to other computer makers, and it says that part of its goal in building hardware is to inspire and guide those companies' designs. But it also wants the Surface line to sell — and although the division has grown enormously in the last few years, becoming a critical part of Microsoft's overall business, Surface is still  far smaller than Apple's Mac or iPad line.
Yet perhaps because it's way behind Apple, Microsoft's hardware division is creating products more daring than much of what has been coming out of its rival lately.
The hybrid Surface Pro — the inheritor of that first Surface's vision, the latest version of which was released in May — hasn't just become a moneymaker for the company. It was also the clear inspiration for the Apple iPad Pro, which supports a pen and keyboard but still feels less like a full-fledged laptop than Surface does.

Late last year, Microsoft also unveiled Surface Studio, a big-screen desktop that bears a passing resemblance to the Apple iMac — except its vertical display effortlessly pivots into a kind of digital drafting table, a slick trick that you can imagine Steve Jobs having lots of fun showing off at a keynote address.
And in the spring, Microsoft showed off Surface Laptop, which sounds humdrum enough; in shape and purpose, it isn't much different from the MacBook Air, Apple's pioneering thin and light laptop. But Microsoft's machine has a better screen than the Air, and, more important, a future. People loved the Air, but Apple doesn't appear to want to upgrade it, so Microsoft stepped in to perfect Apple's baby.
Note, too, that the rest of Apple's PC road map has lately been looking shaky. Apple's  latest laptops left many fans disgruntled, and the Mac Pro has gone years without an update. Apple is now moving quickly to address complaints from its high-end ""pro"" users — it  says the Mac Pro will be redesigned, and a new Pro version of the iMac is coming later this year.
""I think Microsoft has recognized over the last couple years that maybe the creative community isn't as locked into the Mac as many people think it is,"" said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst. ""There's this window of opportunity for Surface to get in there — and even if that window closes with some of Apple's upcoming devices, I don't think Apple has that market locked up.""
Last month, I visited Microsoft's hardware lab at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. I arrived in the midst of a renovation, finding a team of its best hardware designers sitting in a cavernous, mostly empty room — a scene that perfectly captures Microsoft's approach to hardware.
Under Panos Panay, Microsoft's Surface chief, the company has given its designers and engineers license to rethink the future of PCs in grand ways — to sit in an empty room, dream big things, and turn those visions into reality.
""We have this mind-set that says, 'Hey, I'm going to take a shot at this, and if it's not going to work, we'll move on to the next thing,'"" Mr. Panay told me. ""That is celebrated — it's always, 'Let's go, let's move.'""
The mind-set has resulted in several shining ideas. For Surface Studio, Microsoft built a brilliant companion device called Surface Dial — a palm-size knob that sits on your drafting-table screen, creating a tactile interface with which to control your computer.
You can use Dial for basic things like turning up the volume. But in the hands of a designer, it becomes a lovely tool; you can scrub through edits in a video or change your pen color in Photoshop with a turn of the wheel. Like Microsoft's digital stylus — which works across the company's PCs and tablets, whereas Apple staunchly, weirdly opposes adding touch-screen abilities to its Macs — Dial is one of those interface breakthroughs that we might have once looked to Apple for. Now, it's Microsoft that's pushing new modes of computing.
Microsoft's machines aren't perfect. I found Surface Studio, which starts at $3,000, to be underpowered for its price. Surface Pro is a wonderful laptop, but as a tablet, it isn't as good as the iPad. And it, too, is pricey — though it starts at $800, you're looking at $1,200 to $1,500 to get a model with decent speeds and the pen and keyboard accessories (crazily, they're sold separately).
For these reasons and others, it's unlikely that Microsoft's PC hardware business will beat Apple's anytime soon. But anyone who cares about the future of the PC should be thrilled that Apple now faces a serious and creative competitor.

12,2017-07-28,3 reasons why millennials want to work for Google and Amazon so badly  ,"Tech companies like Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft top the list of employers that millennials want to work for. Why? Because they give young professionals what they want most: career growth, flexibility and a sense of purpose.
 In fact, tech companies represent four out of the top five employers millennials want to work for most.
That's according to a  recent study by the survey development platform SurveyMonkey. ""Millennials are primarily interested in opportunities for career growth,"" Jon Cohen, chief research officer at SurveyMonkey, tells CNBC Make It. ""Look at Microsoft, Apple, Google. They all have that same characteristic: growth.""
 The survey was conducted online among a national sample of 13,882 adults evaluating the top 75 companies ranked in the Fortune 500.
 Tech's quick expansion makes room for more jobs
 Cohen says that tech companies grow at a rapid pace, allowing for increased career opportunities and growth throughout the company. Older age groups are more interested in compensation and total package, says Cohen.

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 But for millennials there's a correlation between the top companies they want to work for and how fast those companies are growing, he says. Cohen adds that unlike other age groups, millennials see themselves advancing more swiftly into higher level positions.
In another survey, performed in partnership with job site Ladders, 80 percent of millennials say they expect a promotion within one to two years.
Millennials want ""accelerated promotions,"" which tech companies can provide"" because they have the financial ability and consistently add new roles as they grow, says Cohen.
 Millennials value flexibility over freebies
 Although companies like Google are known for giving perks like  free lunches, few millennials listed these bonuses as reasons they'd want to work for a tech company.
Stephan Dietrich, vice president of computer software platform Adobe Campaign, tells CNBC Make it that ""throwing free things"" at employees is not effective in retaining or attracting top talent.

Google employee at a recreational area
 ""It's artificial to give free lunches and gym memberships,"" says Dietrich. People want to work at a company where they are ""able to learn and be challenged and see results,"" he says. ""Then the career growth comes naturally.""
However, 64 percent of millennials do say that they are most excited about company perks like flexible hours and working from home. Tech companies tend to dominate the lists of organizations that offer such flexibility, Cohen tells CNBC Make It.
 Young professionals want to make an impact
 Finally, millennials care about being challenged, impacting society and making a difference in the world, says Cohen. Working in tech allows them to be on the cutting-edge of society and see their ideas come to fruition.
Along the same lines, millennials are more likely to seek out companies with progressive management. A majority of millennials,  65 percent, say they'd rather work for an organization whose mission they believe in than a company that pays a lot.
Cohen points to Silicon Valley's swift response to President Trump's transgender military ban as well as the travel ban as examples of progressive thought in the tech space.
Dietrich doubles down on the importance of young professionals feeling that they are adding value to a company. He says that his team at Adobe has had a 40 percent growth rate because the ""younger generation is excited about learning and enjoy feeling like they have an impact.""
""If you keep them excited to come into work,"" he says, ""it will bring tremendous growth and revenue.""

 Microsoft shares are falling, in part because the company gave declining profit margin guidance for the next fiscal year during its mid-July earnings report.However, Cowen predicts the worries are overstated and the software giant will report profitability above expectations. As a result, it reiterated its outperform rating on its shares.""We have confidence that the margin concerns on the Street will fade as the year progresses, and we remain bullish on MSFT's opportunities over both the medium and long-term,"" analyst Gregg Moskowitz wrote in a note to clients Monday entitled ""Deeper look into FY18 margins reveals upside potential."" Microsoft has outperformed the market this year. Its shares rallied 17.5 percent year to date through Friday versus the S&P 500's 10.4 percent return. The stock is down 1.6 percent since its July 20 earnings report. Moskowitz raised his Microsoft price target to $85 from $80, representing 16 percent upside from Friday's close. Microsoft gave guidance of a 1 percentage point operating profit margin decline for fiscal 2018. On the forecast the analyst said, ""[T]hat's too low and ... it's very likely that organic margins will expand again this year."" Moskowitz cited how the company projected a similar 1 percentage point margin decline one year ago for fiscal 2017, but ended the year with a 20 basis point margin expansion. ""We believe total Office revenue (consumer + corporate) is poised to accelerate, Cowen's cloud survey work has increased our confidence level in Azure's [cloud computing business] long-term success, an improving annuity mix meaningfully raises visibility and reduces execution risk,"" he wrote. ""There are multiple levers of upside to FY18 revenue and EPS (namely, Azure, O365, gross margins, phone hardware sale and mix shift).""Microsoft shares slightly declined in early Monday morning trading.

14,2017-08-01,Headsets that let you step into Microsoft Windows are now for sale  ,"Todd Haselton | CNBC
 Microsoft is now officially selling mixed reality headsets built by Acer and HP.
The headsets cost $299 and $329, respectively, and offer relatively similar specs. If you have a computer powerful enough to support them — you'll need a modern graphics processor such as an NVIDIA GeForce 1060 to begin — the headsets are capable of transporting you into a whole new world.

 CNBC had a chance to try Acer's headset a couple of months ago and walked away rather impressed by the experience. It's like walking into a virtual version of Windows, complete with couches and other furniture, big screen TVs that can play movies on your computer and much more.
The headsets are out of stock in Microsoft retail locations but can be ordered for delivery within a couple of days. Both are technically ""developer edition"" wearables, however, so expect some bugs and a lack of full-fledged apps for the time being.

 A government crackdown on Amazon is 'inevitable,' says Rich Barton   
 5:51  PM ET Wed,  2 Aug 2017 |  00:51 
 Technology entrepreneur Rich Barton says government intervention on Amazon in the future is unavoidable.
 Barton was asked about his views on Amazon in relation to the Department of Justice's antitrust investigation of Microsoft during the 1990s in a Bloomberg podcast interview.""I lived through that DOJ thing. It was really rough. It's no fun. And I think it is inevitable as companies get really, really huge,"" Barton said in the podcast interview published Friday.
""I think Jeff [Bezos] is probably well aware of that,"" Barton said. Bezos ""is trying to do everything he can to delay that as long as possible and to play within the rules, but eventually the tall poppy gets chopped in.""Barton has served on Netflix's board of directors since 2002. He is one of the few businessmen who have started multiple billion-dollar companies. He founded Expedia in 1994, co-founded Zillow in 2005 and worked as a product manager at Microsoft in the early 1990s. Currently, Barton is a venture partner at Benchmark Capital.Expedia and Zillow have market values of $23 billion and $8 billion respectively, according to FactSet.The entrepreneur also predicted Amazon will likely dominate the software business going forward:
 ""They are really the major force in enterprise software as well now. Because of AWS [Amazon Web Services] and because pretty much most computing is moving into the cloud … The whole enterprise software stack is moving out of these premise based systems as sold by Oracle, Microsoft, IBM [while] Amazon keeps adding more and more functionality embedded as a service within the cloud and is taking over chunk by chunk ... these enterprise software categories."" 
Last week Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hinted the administration may soon take ""a position"" on Amazon's tax collection policy after President Donald Trump repeatedly blasted the company on the topic on Twitter.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. See the full Bloomberg podcast interview here.

Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.
 Salesforce has made the fourth leadership change in four years to its second-largest business, Service Cloud, as it struggles to meet revenue goals. The company has also effectively shut down a similar product for smaller businesses, Desk.com, according to sources.
 Bill Patterson, a 14-year Microsoft veteran who was most recently on the Dynamics team, has joined Service Cloud as its senior vice president and product management leader. He reports to Mike Rosenbaum, Salesforce's executive vice president of customer relationship management applications. Last week Patterson updated his LinkedIn profile to acknowledge his new job. MSDynamicsWorld was first to report the move. 
Service Cloud, a piece of software that customer-service representatives can use to manage inquiries, has been one of Salesforce's main growth drivers in recent years, going from $1.3 billion in sales in 2014 to $2.3 billion in 2016. But despite its growth, Service Cloud has dealt with frequent leadership turnover and a failure to reach its revenue goals in the past several years.
 Patterson is the fourth product leader in the past four years, and the seventh since Service Cloud's launch in 2009. Most recently, the position was held by Adam Blitzer, an executive VP who had been running both the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud teams since December. Patterson's hiring was in part aimed at alleviating some of the pressure Blitzer had felt, as he was managing two products that accounted for 75 percent of Salesforce's total revenue, according to the person. Now Blitzer is solely focusing on Sales Cloud.
""It's a dynamic industry, and things happen,"" Rosenbaum, a 12-year Salesforce veteran, told CNBC. In appointing Patterson, the idea is to assemble a ""better team"" that can take Service Cloud business to the next level, Rosenbaum said.
Although Service Cloud still accounts for 30 percent of Salesforce's revenue, the business' growth has slowed, going from 37.6 percent in year-over-year revenue growth in 2015 to 27.6 percent in 2016, according to Salesforce's most recent annual report. And Service Cloud has failed to reach its revenue goals for the past two years, a source said. (Rosenbaum wouldn't comment on that but did emphasize that IDC says Salesforce leads the customer service and support software market, ahead of Oracle and SAP, among others.)
The Service Cloud group has struggled when it comes to selling to small and medium-sized businesses, two people said. To go after smaller businesses, Salesforce acquired Assistly for around $50 million in 2011 and re-launched it under the Desk.com brand in early 2012.
One of the Desk.com team's assignments, a second source said, was to siphon business away from then-private Zendesk, which has grown into a $3 billion public company. Salesforce even tried to buy Zendesk, but when the effort faltered, the company went after Assistly, the second source said.
Desk.com amounted to a second customer-service tool that cost less money than Service Cloud. Some executives opposed it because it pulled down sales numbers for the bigger Service Cloud business that Desk.com is part of, while some salespeople preferred not to sell it because it left them with less compensation for the deals they landed, the second source said.
Rosenbaum challenged that assertion, saying that salespeople don't decide which types of customer service products to sell -- different sales teams go after different types of companies, he said.
At one point Salesforce had around 200 people working on Desk.com, the source said. But the company hasn't sought attention for a Desk.com product update for 17 months, and it's effectively not actively developing it anymore, according to two people. Salesforce says Asana, Bonobos and Coinbase are among the companies that use Desk.com; Rosenbaum said the company is committed to supporting the customers who still use the tool. The company's experience running Desk.com has influenced the development of its Service Cloud Lightning tool, which is suited for companies of any size, Rosenbaum said.
Patterson is the latest Microsoft executive to jump ship to Salesforce, representing a new development in the on-and-off relationship between the two longtime rivals. Last year, Salesforce brought in Tony Prophet, a marketing exec, as its first chief equality officer. Previously, it brought in Bob Stutz, former Microsoft Dynamics' head of business, and Randy Kern, an executive from Microsoft's Azure cloud business.

 Microsoft just officially listed AI as one of its top priorities, replacing mobile   
 9:02  AM ET Thu,  3 Aug 2017 |  00:39 
 Microsoft just named artificial intelligence as one of its top priorities in a financial filing.
 The annual report for the company's 2017 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, now includes six references to AI, up from zero in the previous annual report.
And the company has plunked AI into its corporate vision statement, too.
 ""Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with AI,"" the company wrote in the annual report, which was released on Wednesday.
For the sake of comparison, here's last year's version: ""Our strategic vision is to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world.""
For Microsoft watchers, that old tagline should sound very familiar -- pretty much ever since he became CEO of Microsoft in 2014, Satya Nadella has repeatedly spoken of the ""mobile-first and cloud-first world"" that the company was trying to target.

 Mobile is gone -- not a surprise, given the company's struggles with its Windows Phone operating system and its acquisition of Nokia, which Microsoft essentially declared worthless when it wrote down the total value of that acquisition in 2015.
Cloud computing, including fast-growing products like Office 365 and the Azure public cloud are still there. Now AI is there with it, too.
Microsoft has acquired a few AI startups, like Maluuba and Swiftkey, since Nadella took over, and has established a formal AI and Research group. That team ""focuses on our AI development and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, applications, and search,"" the annual report says.
Microsoft's vision reset comes after Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet's Google, began saying that the world is shifting from being mobile-first to AI-first. Facebook has also invested in both long-term AI research and AI product enhancements alongside Microsoft and Alphabet.

 Eye Control is aimed at ""empowering people with disabilities to operate an on-screen mouse, keyboard, and text-to-speech experience using only their eyes,"" Microsoft said in a blog post on Wednesday.
Users require eye tracking hardware by Tobii in order to try out the feature.
 When Eye Control is launched a box appears allowing a user to choose to control the mouse, keyboard or text-to-speech feature with their eyes.
When the mouse function is selected, a user has to look at what they want to click on then select, again with their eyes, what action they want to take such as a left click or right click.
Typing works in a similar way. Users need to look at letters that they want to type. But Microsoft is also trialing a feature called ""shape-writing"" to help people type faster with their eyes.
""You can form words by dwelling at the first and last character of the word, and simply glancing at letters in between. A hint of the word predicted will appear on the last key of the word,"" Microsoft explained.

That machine effectively changed his life. He spent as much time as he could learning about computers, hacking and coding. He and a school friend named Paul Allen bonded over their love of technology. They would later co-found Microsoft.

 Activist investor Morfit Mason and ValueAct sold about 7 million shares of Microsoft's stock over the past week, according to regulatory filings released on Tuesday. 
 The shares were sold at prices ranging from $72.50 apiece to $72.61 apiece, valuing the stake at over $500 million. 
Morfit sits on Microsoft's board of directors, a seat he got after ValueAct's campaign in 2013. The San Francisco-based investment company announced a $2 billion stake in Microsoft on CNBC, amid shareholder grumblings that the stock had not performed well under then-CEO Steve Ballmer.
 Ballmer announced his resignation shortly before ValueAct was granted a board seat, although he said it was not related to pressure from ValueAct.
Shares of Microsoft have shot up nearly 125 percent since Ballmer announced his retirement in August 2013, when shares traded at prices between $30 and $35 a share. CEO Satya Nadella has pushed the company deeper into cloud computing and computer hardware, and made a splash acquisition of LinkedIn, expected to expand Microsoft's reach into industries like recruiting and human resources.
More recently, ValueAct, which manages about $15 billion, has turned its attention to companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, and also has stakes in various energy, healthcare and technology companies.

 Consumer Reports says 25 percent of Microsoft Surface computers will break within two years   
 12:56  PM ET Thu, 10 Aug 2017 |  00:48 
 You might want to hold off on buying a Microsoft Surface tablet or laptop.
 Consumer Reports said Thursday it's pulling its recommendation on Microsoft Surface laptops and tablets (including the Surface Pro, Surface Book and Surface Laptop) because of ""poor predicted reliability in comparison to most other brands.""
The magazine says its survey found that ""25 percent of Microsoft laptops and tablets will present their owners with problems by the end of the second year of ownership."" It said its warning applies even to Microsoft's devices that launched just a couple of months ago.
 CNBC reviewed the new Surface Pro in June and found that, while it was a powerful tablet that also doubles as a competitive laptop, the configuration options are far more expensive than what most consumers could buy from Microsoft's competitors.
Consumer Reports said that responses to its annual survey revealed that consumers weren't pleased with their Microsoft products during the lifetime of ownership. Frozen computers, unexpected shutdowns and unresponsive screens were noted as complaints.
""While we respect Consumer Reports, we disagree with their findings,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC. ""Microsoft's real-world return and support rates and customer satisfaction data show we are on par if not better than other devices in the category. We stand firmly behind the quality and reliability of the Surface family of devices and continue to make quality our primary focus.""
In a subsequent blog post Panos Panay, corporate vice president of Microsoft Devices, said the Consumer Reports survey was ""disappointing.""
Microsoft is new to the hardware business and has generally been met with favorable reviews of its laptops from consumers and pundits in the industry. Surface revenues were down 2 percent during the last quarter, though there were expectations revenues would increase this quarter with newer models on the market.

 });Currently, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is worth almost $90 billion and is the richest man in the world, according to Forbes.
 But everybody starts somewhere. 
A glimpse of his resume from 1974, when he was 18, reveals that during his first year at Harvard, Gates was already making $15,000.
 In today's dollars,  that's almost $75,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' inflation calculator. Impressive for a college freshman.
Though it's not clear from where that income came, the resume says that he and future Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen (today worth more than $20 billion) were working ""in partnership"" and had designed a program for an early Intel computer.

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 The CV also shows Gates worked as a programmer at TRW Systems Group in Vancouver, a developer of military and civil space systems (which was  acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2002).
 Both Gates and Allen structured their early resumes similarly. First, they listed computer-related coursework — where Gates points out he received all As in the courses mentioned, like Operating Systems Structure, Data Base Management and Computer Graphics. Next came the computer programming languages in which they were proficient. Finally, came work experience.
Interestingly, they also both listed their height, weight and marital status — something that wouldn't fly today for someone working in computer programming.  
Gates, 18 at the time, was 5' 10"" and weighed 130 pounds. He was ""unmarried.""
Allen, then 21, was 5' 11"" and weighed 185 pounds. He was also ""unmarried.""
Gates and Allen went on to found Micro-Soft together in 1975 in Albuquerque, N.M. The next year they would rename the computing company Microsoft and in 1979 they moved the company to Washington state. Today, Microsoft has a market cap of more than $550 billion.
Both Gates and Allen's resumes were shared on Twitter by Fast Company's technology editor, Harry McCracken. He took the photos at the Living Computers Museum in Seattle, he says.
 Bill Gates' resume, from an era when he aspired to make 15 grand.
 You all liked Bill Gates' resume circa 1974 when I shared it, so here (also from the Living Computers museum) is Paul Allen's.

20,2017-08-11,Microsoft has found an inexpensive way to save lives in India  Tech giants Apple and Microsoft lead the Dow  ,"From hacking agriculture to developing inexpensive tools for tuberculosis patients, Microsoft researchers in India are trying to solve myriad social problems in the subcontinent.
 India is a research and development hot-bed for large tech companies like Microsoft for several reasons: It has an increasingly middle-class young population and it has significant challenges present in society that can be solved using advanced technology.
 Satish Bate | Hindustan Times | Getty Images
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers his keynotes at the company’s flagship technology and business conference -- Future Decoded 2017 in Mumbai, India.
 U.S. market research firm Forrester said in a report earlier this year that India's rising levels of education, abundance of technical talent, open and growing economy and rising mobile penetration will also contribute to digital proliferation. The firm predicted that, by 2020, India will have about 690 million internet users. 
 That implies that there's going to always be a market for new tech products or services that address specific issues in society. So, for companies like Microsoft, there is a big potential customer base.
In fact, the number of research and development centers being set up by large multinational companies in India is rising, according to a report widely cited by Indian media.
 Microsoft takes on social issues
 Microsoft Research India investigates machine learning, natural language processing, algorithms, cryptography and data sciences for the tech giant. It also explores creating technology for emerging markets. The organization works extensively with the Indian and international scientific community, academia and other Microsoft Research Labs in places like the U.K., China and the U.S.
""One of the things that we're trying to do in an organization like Microsoft Research is to predict and invent the future,"" Sriram Rajamani, managing director of Microsoft Research India, told CNBC.
Rajamani oversees a team of about 55 full-time staff, 30 research fellows who are usually fresh graduates and approximately 100 interns throughout the year.
Current projects from the research lab include Melange, which is trying to study multilingual speech that can help to humanize virtual assistants in the future, and make them more accessible to the developing world.
Another project — Harnessing AutoMobiles for Safety (HAMS) — uses sensors like a smartphone's front-camera, a phone's GPS and a vehicle's on-board diagnostics scanner to detect and alert if a driver is distracted or sleepy while driving.
 ""The interesting thing to understand is that research is a social process. Most of the research teams (at Microsoft Research India), they have decided to form together on their own. Because I don't tell them to do this together, but they cannot do it alone.""
-Sriram Rajamani, managing director, Microsoft Research India
 Most of the projects are rolled out in small pilots, sometimes in cooperation with state governments in India. The successful ones then go on to scale up. Sometimes they are also brought to other markets.
One of the more prominent programs is 99DOTS, a four-year-old project that makes special envelopes for health-care providers to use for tuberculosis medication. After the patient takes the daily dose of medicine, a unique, toll-free phone number is revealed. With each daily call, the patient's doctors can monitor if they missed a dose in real-time and send reminders and other incentives.
Bill Thies and Andrew Cross, who were the two main researchers working on 99DOTS, have formed a separate company called Everwell Health Solutions. There's now a licensing agreement with Microsoft Research and the company is employing people to scale 99DOTS throughout the country, according to Rajamani. He added that, if it works, there are plans to bring the concept abroad.
Microsoft also rolled out a skills development initiative in India called Project Sangam. It is a cloud-based platform that integrates with LinkedIn, where users complete online courses for new skills and are then matched with relevant job vacancies. Part of the idea behind Project Sangam came from the Massively Empowered Classrooms project that was experimenting with how technology can improve the quality of higher education in India, according to Rajamani.
Another Microsoft team in India, he explained, was also thinking about how to skill and train blue collar labor in the country, and so Project Sangam was created.
 Localizing
 Having research and development centers in India also allows companies to localize their existing products to fit the target demographic. For tech companies, those are people who are newly acquainted with technology and are connecting to the internet for the first time. 
Analysts have argued that localization of products and services in emerging markets like India is key to success for multinationals. 
Ashutosh Sharma, a research director and vice president at Forrester, told CNBC that, when it comes to the Indian market, there are some similarities to the West on the surface: an English-speaking, younger demographic with growing disposable income.
But beyond that, it's a lot more complicated. ""When you scratch the surface, there's a lot of issues with respect to the digital population in India,"" he said. ""First of all, the awareness level beyond using their mobile phones for (social media) is non-existent.""
Sharma also pointed out that language is an issue in a country with more than a dozen main languages and hundreds of dialects. In fact, beyond the major cities, few people interact in English. Moreover, the disposable income in India's smaller cities and rural areas is low.
""So people are very careful about the way they spend money. There's not that much money to go around with respect to the income level,"" said Sharma.
But the Indian government has expressed well-documented interest in promoting digital literacy and technological advancements throughout the country. On a national level, that includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Digital India"" campaign to improve online infrastructure and services, the rolling out of a national identification system, and the newly passed goods and services legislation that requires businesses to file their tax returns online.

 Microsoft's Rajamani said the government's willingness to make India more digital provides researchers the opportunity to work on new projects that can have a high impact on society. He explained that researchers choose projects they are interested in exploring and senior managers do not dictate any specific focus areas. Still, most of the existing projects fall under categories like artificial intelligence, mobile and cloud computing — areas that are crucial to Microsoft's global business strategies.
""The interesting thing to understand is that research is a social process. Most of the research teams (at Microsoft Research India), they have decided to form together on their own,"" Rajamani said. ""I don't tell them to do this together, but they cannot do it alone.""
Researchers do not choose projects on a whim, according to Rajamani, as they need to be able to convince their colleagues to collaborate on their ideas. Still, since the researchers are paid employees of Microsoft, the availability of funding and resources is not an issue — something that academic research can't say.

21,2017-08-14,Amazon used a small acquisition to catch up with Microsoft Azure on security  ,"Source: Amazon Web Services
Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services and Infrastructure.
 Amazon Web Services announced a new security service called Amazon Macie at an event in New York on Monday.
 The tool draws partly on technology from Harvest.ai, a San Diego start-up that Amazon acquired.
""Amazon Macie is an entirely new service that combines the concepts established by Harvest.AI with AWS's machine learning technology and expertise,"" an AWS spokesman told CNBC in an email. TechCrunch reported on the acquisition in January.
 Amazon Macie looks for sensitive data such as passwords that you store in AWS, applies risk ratings to your different collections of data and then alerts you to unusual access patterns that could indicate a security threat. 
The introduction of Macie gives Amazon, the market leader in the public cloud business, an answer to one thing Microsoft has been doing on its Azure cloud, which is AWS' closest competitor. When customers store data in the Microsoft's Azure SQL Database, they can enable Threat Detection, which picks up on attacks and other suspicious database activity and then sends alerts to admins.
Meanwhile, Alphabet's Google public cloud recently introduced a tool developers can use to spot and then redact sensitive data. 
But as a whole, Amazon Macie does more than the Google and Microsoft tools.
AWS is playing up the use of artificial intelligence in Amazon Macie. It automates the process of spotting sensitive data, AWS said, with ""highly accurate, machine learning based detection of over 70 data types related to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Health Information (PHI), regulatory documents, API keys and secret key material.""
Macie arrives a few months after AWS introduced an initial suite of AI services. Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google cloud also have AI services. AWS also been working on an AI-enabled text translation service that could compete with Google's tool for that.

Satya Nadella speaking at the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 Microsoft on Tuesday announced that it has acquired Cycle Computing, a 12-year-old company that specializes in running complex high-performance computing workloads across different public clouds. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
 The move could help Microsoft ensure that more of the supercomputing jobs companies want to do end up on its Azure public cloud, rather than other public clouds, such as the market-leading Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform. Currently Cycle Computing's CycleCloud Software helps companies run certain computing jobs on multiple clouds, and then provision more or less infrastructure as necessary.
""We will continue to support Cycle Computing clients using AWS and/or Google Cloud,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. ""While future Microsoft versions released will be Azure focused, we're committed to providing customers a seamless migration experience to Azure if and when they choose to migrate.""
 The deal comes three years after Microsoft bought high-performance computing company GreenButton. But last year AWS acquired another one of these companies called Nice.
JP Morgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, Pfizer and Western Digital are among the companies that have worked with Cycle Computing, which was founded in 2005. The company's tools will manage 1 billion core-hours of computing resources this year, Cycle Computing CEO Jason Stowe wrote in a blog post.
 ""Their technology will further enhance our support of Linux HPC workloads and make it easier to extend on-premise workloads to the cloud,"" Jason Zander, corporate vice president at Microsoft Azure, wrote in a blog post.

Bill Gates
 Bill Gates has made his largest donation in 17 years, giving away $4.6 billion worth of shares in Microsoft Corp.
 The billionaire philanthropist, who has long been the world's richest man, donated 64 million shares accounting for five percent of his overall fortune, according to a Securities & Exchange Commission filing released Monday and first cited by Bloomberg.
The donation reduces Gates stake in the software maker to 1.3 percent.
 The recipient of the gift was not disclosed in the filing dated June 6. However, a SEC filing by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on August 14, cited a donation by Microsoft of 64 million shares. The charity set up by Gates and his wife to promote global development has been the recipient of the majority of Gates' previous donations. 
Gates' most recent pledge takes his overall charitable donations to approximately $50 billion, based on the foundation's most recent financial statement.
In 2000, the businessman who co-founded Microsoft in 1975, gave away more than $20 billion worth of shares, according to Bloomberg calculations.
Gates' estimated net worth is $89.9 billion, as of July 2017. He was briefly overtaken by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos as the world's richest man on 27 July this year.

 10:36  AM ET Fri,  7 April 2017 |  00:59 
 In June 2013 alone, Gates donated nearly $5 billion to education, the  Washington Post reports.
At the summit, Gates says that ""going to a four-year university and getting a degree isn't as much about what you learn in that experience as it is a badge"" that you are employable, organized and you ""like to be measured in terms of what you are doing.""
Gates, who famously dropped out from Harvard University after just two years to become an entrepreneur, has supported personalized learning as a tech-forward method of education. On his blog, he describes the method as ""combining digital tools, project-based learning and traditional classroom work to let students move at their own pace.""

""I see those things decoupling,"" Gates says, adding ""the way you prove that you have certain skills can be very straightforward."" One digitally-savvy way to do so is by participating in massive open online courses.
These make classes offered at universities like Harvard and MIT more available to people so they can gain knowledge without traditional access to these institutions. 
In the future, Gates says many of the people responsible for deep innovations ""will be polymathic, they will be unusually strange people who learn a lot of things and, therefore, able to reason across the boundaries of two subject areas.""

""Fortunately, a very small percentage of society can do the innovations that benefit society very broadly,"" he says.

Diane Greene, Sr. Vice President for Google's Cloud businesses.
 In its bid to compete with Amazon Web Services, Google has opened data centers in four countries outside the U.S. this year and has plans to launch in five more before 2019.
 But one big market is not on the list: China.
Google's absence, which stems from a long-standing feud with the world's second-biggest economy, is costing the company business and making it harder to challenge AWS and Microsoft Azure in the rapidly expanding cloud infrastructure market. 
 Earlier this year, one of Google's marquee cloud clients, Snap, cited the service's unavailability in China as a reason that it may not be able to enter the market. Days later, Snap disclosed a deal with AWS, which opened a region of data centers in Beijing in 2014. 
Snap didn't say if China played into the AWS deal, but it's clear that Alphabet's cloud business is missing out on one of the biggest areas of growth in tech.
China's market for cloud infrastructure and software will more than quadruple by 2021 to $9.8 billion from $2.4 billion last year, according to IDC. To build a presence there, AWS partnered with a local company, Beijing Sinnet Technology, as did Microsoft, which teamed up with 21Vianet for data centers in Beijing and Shanghai. Internet data center licenses in China can't be granted to foreign companies.

 Without AWS, Amazon not even worth $100: Analyst   
 1:05  AM ET Wed,  5 April 2017 |  01:34 
 The market leader, according to Gartner, is Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which said last week that its cloud revenue for the latest quarter almost doubled to $359 million. Chinese internet companies Baidu and Tencent also have cloud offerings.
Without a physical presence in China, Google is at a major disadvantage in trying to serve emerging businesses that are turning to the cloud for computing, storage and a growing number of applications and features. Its closest data centers are in Taiwan and Singapore. 
AWS, meanwhile, is in the process of setting up a second Chinese region -- in Ningxia -- as well as opening a Hong Kong region.
Google already has a big gap to close. According to Synergy Research, Google is fourth in global cloud infrastructure with 5 percent of the market, trailing AWS, Azure and IBM. With such a small presence, Google has plenty of places it can grow and is opening cloud locations in countries including India and Brazil.
""Google today is in so few countries -- they have a lot of other fish to go fry,"" said Lydia Leong, an analyst at Gartner, in an interview.
 Google previously explored opening a data center in Hong Kong, but in 2013 the company told the Wall Street Journal that it altered its plans. Google executives have told partners that the company would like to set up a China-based cloud service ""eventually,"" tech website The Information reported in January.
Google didn't answer several questions about its strategy for China, and offered only the following statement by e-mail: ""No plans to bring Google Cloud to China.""
To understand why Google is a no-show in the Chinese cloud market, you have to rewind the clock to 2010.
That year, Google made a radical change in its operations in China, breaking with the country's practices of censoring internet content. Google shut down the local service, redirecting visitors from Google.cn (the mainland site) to the uncensored Google.com.hk in Hong Kong. When the Chinese government objected, Google put up a landing page telling users to navigate to the Hong Kong site.  
 'Have to cooperate'
 ""We heard about Google's plan of returning to China but so far there is not any clear message,"" said Richard Zhao, a senior research manager at IDC and an expert in China's IT market. If they're going to open, ""they have to cooperate with local partners to run public cloud services,"" he said.
It seems unlikely that Google Cloud would make a big push in China without the prospect of core services like search and Google Maps going live there as well. 
But in recent months, under the leadership of Diane Greene, Google's cloud business has shown a heightened level of autonomy. It was Greene who announced in June that Google would stop scanning Gmail users' emails to personalize ads. And in the first half of 2017, Alphabet's biggest growth in headcount was in cloud.
Ruth Porat, Google's finance chief, told analysts that the cloud growth is ""consistent with the priority we place on this business.""
Clearly, that priority has yet to reach China.

On Tuesday Google is launching Chrome Enterprise, a service that will give IT admins inside enterprises the ability to manage devices running Google's open-source Chrome OS desktop operating system, using tools they're already familiar with. The new license, which will cost $50 per year per Chrome OS device, is an enhancement of the Chrome device management license that's been available since 2011.
 Admins can start using existing user profiles in Microsoft Active Directory software running in on-premises data centers for managing employees' Chromebook use. Additionally admins will be able to manage Chromebooks from VMware's Airwatch enterprise mobility management software, with alternatives to come later.
The new license is Google's attempt to improve the software part of the equation to get big companies to buy more Chromebooks. Google has previously tried to entice companies with discounts on Chromebooks themselves. More recently Google has gotten third-party hardware makers to develop non-laptop Chrome OS devices, including a Samsung convertible tablet with an integrated stylus.
Worldwide Chromebook shipments were up 38 percent in 2016, while the overall PC market dropped 6 percent, Gartner said last month.
The move comes after Apple has partnered with Cisco, Deloitte, IBM and SAP in an effort to get iOS devices into enterprises. Both Apple and Google are eager to displace Windows in the enterprise.
To make Chromebooks more versatile and less limited to what's available on the web, Google has been taking steps to bring the Google Play Store to Chromebooks, opening the door to millions of Android apps. The Play Store now works on more than 25 types of Chromebooks, and company administrators can restrict or allow specific Android apps to be run on Chrome OS devices, Google group product manager Eve Phillips told CNBC in an interview.

The D-Wave 2000Q Quantum Computer
 Morgan Stanley said quantum computing will have dramatic implications across several industries during the next decade.
 Quantum computers use atomic particles and the laws of physics to perform calculations. They are faster than current computers and will enable much higher computing power, according to Morgan Stanley.
""With more companies moving quantum computers from the lab to commercial activities, we believe widespread quantum computing is about to become a reality and holds the key to double the high-end computing market,"" the firm's research team wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.""We believe quantum computing could trigger the beginning of a fourth industrial revolution, with far reaching consequences for many sectors where computing power is becoming a limitation for R&D.""
 Here are the industries and applications Morgan Stanley said will be most affected by the new computing paradigm:
 ""Financials, Pharma (drug discovery), Oil & Gas (well data analysis), Utilities (nuclear fusion), Chemicals (polymer design), Aerospace & Defense (plane design), Capital Goods (digital manufacturing and predictive maintenance), Artificial Intelligence, and Big Data search in general."" 
The firm said IBM, Google, Microsoft and Nokia Bell Labs currently have the ""most credible"" quantum computing pipelines.
With faster computing, ""classical algorithms, which would take years to solve on a current supercomputer, could take just hours or minutes on a quantum computer,"" they said. The analysts said that, according to IBM, the current size of the high-end computing market is $5 billion to $6 billion per year. Morgan Stanley predicts the market will grow to $10 billion a year in the next decade due to the rise of quantum computing. ""We expect the next 10 years to see a rebalancing favoring commercial vs consumer computing as quantum computers are able to solve many problems that could not be solved up until now,"" they wrote.

27,2017-08-29,When Microsoft saved Apple: Steve Jobs and Bill Gates show eliminating competition isn't the only way to win  ,"Steve Jobs and Bill Gates'  rivalrous friendship is the stuff of tech lore. The most poignant moment of that fraught relationship happened 20 years ago. In August of 1997, Gates stepped in and saved Apple, which, at the time, was on the brink of bankruptcy.
 ""Bill, thank you. The world's a better place,"" Jobs told Gates after the Microsoft exec agreed to make a $150 million investment in Apple.
 20 years ago this week, Steve Jobs was on the cover of @TIME, thanking @BillGates for ""saving Apple."" pic.twitter.com/AhUnLnOZ8t— Codecademy (@Codecademy) August 24, 2017
 At the time, that quote was memorialized on the  cover of Time Magazine and was recently resurfaced by Code Academy on the online coding school's Twitter feed. 
 The corporate olive branch shocked the tech and business communities. ""Even in cyberspace, the moment can only be described as  surreal,"" the New York Times opinion section wrote in the wake of the deal.
Ten years later, when the iconic tech leaders met on-stage at the D5 tech conference, interviewed by Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg, they reflected on their coming together.

 });
 ""Apple was in very serious trouble,"" said Jobs. ""And what was really clear was that if the game was a zero-sum game where for Apple to win, Microsoft had to lose, then Apple was going to lose.
""There were too many people at Apple and in the Apple ecosystem playing [that] game,"" he explained. ""And it was clear that you didn't have to play that game, because Apple wasn't going to beat Microsoft.
""Apple didn't have to beat Microsoft. Apple had to remember who Apple was because they'd forgotten who Apple was.""
To stay alive, Jobs had to step outside of the competitive mindset.
""To me, it was pretty essential to break that paradigm,"" says Jobs. ""And it was also important that, you know, Microsoft was the biggest software developer outside of Apple developing for the Mac. So it was just crazy what was happening at that time. And Apple was very weak and so I called Bill up and we tried to patch things up.""
 The two founders did just that, though their partnership met with resistance. When Jobs announced the $150 million investment at the Macworld Boston conference in 1997, the audience booed Gates' appearance via satellite.
For Microsoft, the investment meant propping up one of its greatest competitors, but it was also a new business opportunity.
""That's worked out very well,"" says Gates at the 2007 conference. ""In fact, every couple years or so, there's been something new that we've been able to do on the Mac and it's been a great business for us.""
Also, as part of the deal, Apple agreed to drop a lawsuit accusing Microsoft of copying its operating system.
At the time that Microsoft saved Apple, Microsoft was by far and away the larger of the two companies. That standing has since flipped: Apple's market capitalization is $839 billion and Microsoft's is $560 billion.
The 1997 deal didn't end the competition between the two tech companies. Rather, they went on to, in lockstep, shaping the computing industry together.
 Today it’s a little-known (and mythologized) story of tech that still shows that cooperation can work hand-in-hand with competition.— Codecademy (@Codecademy) August 24, 2017
 ""Today it's a little-known (and mythologized) story of tech that still shows that cooperation can work hand-in-hand with competition,"" writes Code Academy.
When Jobs died in 2011, Gates honored the Apple icon as both competitor and friend.
""Steve and I first met nearly 30 years ago, and have been colleagues, competitors and friends over the course of more than half our lives,"" Gates wrote. ""The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come. For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it's been an insanely great honor. I will miss Steve immensely.""

 9:34  AM ET Wed, 30 Aug 2017 |  01:00 
 Amazon and Microsoft announced a new partnership that will allow better integration between the tech titans' two digital assistants.
 Amazon's voice-powered digital assistant Alexa will now be able to activate Microsoft's own assistant Cortana, and vice versa. The partnership means Amazon customers can use Alexa to access Cortana's exclusive features such as accessing work calendars, while Microsoft customers can use Cortana to ask Alexa to order products from Amazon or control their smart home devices.
""Ensuring Cortana is available for our customers everywhere and across any device is a key priority for us,"" said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, in a press release Wednesday.
 ""Bringing Cortana's knowledge, Office 365 integration, commitments, and reminders to Alexa is a great step toward that goal.""
 Todd Haselton | CNBC
 Amazon's personal assistant Alexa was first announced in November 2014 alongside the Echo, Amazon's smart speaker. Meanwhile, Cortana was announced by Microsoft in May 2015 and released for its Windows Phone product.
""There are going to be multiple successful intelligent agents, each with access to different sets of data and with different specialized skill areas. Together, their strengths will complement each other and provide customers with a richer and even more helpful experience,"" Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, said in a press release.

29,2017-08-31,Microsoft just made it easier for programmers to use archrival Amazon's cloud  Silicon Valley is preparing to blast Trump if he ends protections for Dreamers  ,"Ruben Sprich | Reuters
Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft
 Amazon and Microsoft, two archrivals in cloud computing and stiff competitors for Seattle-area tech talent, are cooperating a lot more.
 Earlier this week, we saw the marriage of Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant and Microsoft's Cortana.
Now, the companies are teaming up so programmers can more easily take code they manage in Microsoft's tools, and roll it out on Amazon's cloud. 
 On Thursday Microsoft published a blog post detailing the ways in which its Team Foundation Server on-premises software and its Visual Studio Team Services cloud service can hook into various Amazon Web Services tools.
After installing the new tools, developers can upload content to AWS' widely used S3 storage service, automate the deployments with AWS' CodeDeploy tool and run apps with the Lambda serverless-computing service, among other things, without leaving the confines of the Microsoft products
To build the integrations, Amazon engineers collaborated with members of Microsoft's Visual Studio ALM Rangers group, Microsoft program manager Joseph Bourne wrote in the blog post. The ALM Rangers group is tasked with coming up with ""out of band solutions for missing features or guidance,"" Microsoft has said.
Effectively, Microsoft is providing a new source of revenue for AWS, the biggest cloud around and the main competitor to Microsoft's own Azure cloud. That's notable because historically Microsoft has advertised the ability for people to use its source code management programs with Azure.
But if Microsoft is serious about making things as simple as possible for end users, then the move makes sense. 
The openness lines up with Microsoft's recent willingness under CEO Satya Nadella to work with non-Microsoft platforms. For example, Microsoft has made it possible for people to use Linux in its Windows 10 operating system.
At the end of July, Amazon held 34 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, while Microsoft had 11 percent, according to Synergy Research.

President Donald Trump announces his strategy for the war in Afghanistan during an address to the nation from Fort Myer, Virginia, August 21, 2017.
 President Donald Trump is expected on Friday to eliminate a program protecting young people brought to the United States illegally as children from being deported — a move that's drawing fierce criticism from the tech industry.
The program in question is called  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and since it was implemented under former President Barack Obama, more than 800,000 so-called Dreamers have been allowed to stay in the country by obtaining renewable work permits.
But Trump pledged on the campaign trail to scrap the Obama-era initiative. Even after promising in recent months to treat Dreamers with ""great heart,"" he has weighed ways to end the program, known by its acronym DACA,  according to numerous reports this week. Early details suggest Trump's announcement Friday would allow Dreamers to stay in the United States until their work permits run out. Under the existing program, permits must be renewed every two years.

Once again, Trump risks open warfare with the tech industry, which has fiercely defended immigration programs — in no small part because of the high concentration of foreign workers and families in tech hubs like Silicon Valley.
Microsoft, for one, implored Trump on Thursday to reconsider his plan, noting that at least 27 of its employees — from engineers to financial professionals — could be affected by changes targeting the Dreamers.

Some, like  Apple CEO Tim Cook, have specifically expressed to Trump directly their desire to see DACA kept intact.
The expected announcement Friday comes amid the threat of a looming lawsuit from 10 state attorneys general, led by Texas, who oppose DACA — and said they would  take Trump to court if he hadn't canceled it by Sept. 5.

 Microsoft responded strongly to the Trump administration's decision on Tuesday to move toward rescinding or replacing DACA within six months.
 ""There is nothing that we will be pushing on more strongly for congress to act on,"" Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said in an interview with NPR. ""We put a stake in the ground. We care about a tax reform bill,"" Smith said, noting that the entire business community cares about one but that this needs to be settled first.
Smith added that it won't be easy for the government to deport Microsoft employees who are DREAMers: ""[The government's] going to have to go through us to get that person,"" Smith said. 
 Microsoft is the latest tech company to speak out against the move. Smith made similar comments in a public letter.
Smith and Microsoft call on Congress to ""reprioritize the fall legislative calendar and move quickly with the new legislation to protect these 800,000 Dreamers."" Congress, which just returned to session on Tuesday after the Labor Day weekend, has a lot to tackle, including tax reform.
""As an employer, we appreciate that Dreamers add to the competitiveness and economic success of our company and the entire nation's business community,"" Microsoft said. ""In short, urgent DACA legislation is both an economic imperative and a humanitarian necessity.""
Microsoft said it has 39 DACA recipients among its employees and that it will ""exercise its legal rights properly to help protect our employees,"" even if Congress doesn't come to a decision on new legislation to replace or rescind DACA within six months.
""In short, if Dreamers who are our employees are in court, we will be by their side,"" Microsoft said.

A crane loads a shipping container branded A.P. Moller-Maersk onto a freight ship.
 Accounting giant EY said Wednesday that it plans to launch the first blockchain platform for marine insurance, alongside Microsoft, A.P Moller-Maersk and others.
 The distributed ledger will be used to capture information about shipments, risk and liability, and to help firms comply with insurance regulations.
It will also ensure transparency across an interconnected network of clients, brokers, insurers and other third parties.
 EY explained that its decision to secure marine insurance data with blockchain was due to a ""complete inefficiency"" in the sector.
""The reason we chose marine (insurance) as the starting point for this sort of market is mainly because of its complete inefficiency,"" Shaun Crawford, global insurance leader at EY, told CNBC via phone earlier this week ahead of the announcement.
Crawford said the industry was ""over capacity"" and that there was ""a lot of cost to it.""
He added: ""It's facing high administrative burdens of managing and writing claims with a lot of paperwork. All contracts are signed multiple times. They go from ship to ship, port to port, through quite a journey.""
Distributed ledgers are groupings of data shared across multiple locations without the need for central administrators and other middle men.
The original blockchain was built to serve as the distributed ledger for bitcoin transactions. But various blockchain experts believe the technology can provide transparency for a multitude of different industries, not just the financial services.
""We're not talking about a new currency here, we're not talking about money. We're talking about data aggregation,"" EY's Crawford added.
Maersk said the blockchain platform would enable the shipping giant to maintain a smoother relationship with the insurance market.

 ""It is a priority for us to leverage technology to streamline and automate our interaction with the insurance market,"" Lars Henneberg, head of risk and insurance at Maersk said in a statement Wednesday.
""Insurance transactions are currently far too tedious and frictional. The distance between risk and capital is simply too far. Blockchain technology has the potential to facilitate the desired development that is long overdue.""
 Blockchain could benefit wider insurance industry
 Marine insurance has traditionally relied on physical contracts being shipped to and fro, from one port to another, in order to be eventually signed, according to EY.
The global research firm has worked closely with software security company Guardtime to develop the blockchain platform.
Guardtime said it expects to roll out blockchain to the wider insurance industry after its initial marine insurance deployment.
""Initially, we focused on marine insurance as it is well-suited to a blockchain solution as it has a complex international ecosystem, with multiple parties, multiple jurisdictions, high transaction volumes and significant levels of reconciliation,"" Guardtime CEO Mike Gault told CNBC in an emailed note prior to the announcement.
""But down the line we expect it to be rolled out across other areas of insurance markets — as there are clearly shared benefits and attributes. In fact, blockchain can be applied to any commercial or specialty line of business with high-value assets.""
 Blockchain built on Microsoft Azure
 The blockchain solution was built on Microsoft's cloud platform, Microsoft Azure.
Cloud technology allows firms to store data and software via the internet rather than locally on a hard drive.
A proof of concept for EY's digital ledger was completed in March.

 ""When we built the proof of concept, we built a prototype on Azure to make sure the whole thing worked and is secure, and now what we're doing is building it,"" EY's Crawford noted.
""We provide that cloud service which we believe is one of the strongest ones on the market, and that's why we chose Microsoft to work with.""
Guardtime said Microsoft's cloud offered a secure network on which to build the blockchain.
""For any new system to be implemented it needs to be built using the right model, one that is robust, scalable and can co-exist with existing IT infrastructure or systems,"" Guardtime's Gault said.
""That's what Azure and the cloud technology enables us to do, without comprising performance or flexibility, which is why it was so important to partner with Microsoft.""
Mark Russinovish, chief technology officer at Microsoft Azure, said that blockchain had the potential to be ""transformational.""
""Microsoft believes blockchain is a transformational technology with the ability to significantly reduce the friction of doing business, especially streamlining business processes shared across multiple organizations,"" he said.
He added: ""Marine insurance is a prime example of a complex business process that can be optimized with blockchain.""
Insurers MS Amlin and XL Catlin also collaborated with EY on the project, as well as insurance industry body ACORD (Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development).
The blockchain solution is set to be implemented from January 2018 onwards.
The race to create large distributed ledger network has become increasingly competitive.
IBM for instance announced it would partner with food giants like Nestle and Unilever in August, and use blockchain technology to trace the movements of food to avoid tackle contamination faster.
EY told CNBC that its decision to make the announcement ahead of time was due to a host of other players making similar moves.

Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp
 Microsoft on Thursday announced a strengthened partnership with Adobe, building on the deal the two companies announced last year.
 Microsoft Azure is becoming the ""preferred"" public cloud for the Adobe Sign e-signature tool, and Adobe Sign will become the ""preferred"" e-signature tool for various Microsoft applications. Additionally, Adobe is bringing Sign and its other cloud services into Microsoft Teams, a communication app that's been compared with Slack.
""We want to empower people to do their best work, and the more friction we can take out of the process for the customer to stay in just a single app and not have to hop around, we find is really pleasing to the customer,"" Microsoft executive vice president Peggy Johnson told CNBC in an interview.
 In Microsoft Teams, for example, a person will be able to ask someone to sign off on a document without leaving the app.
Microsoft has previously done partnerships with the likes of Citrix, HPE and NetSuite to ensure its tools are ""preferred."" And in May, DocuSign, a competitor of Adobe Sign, announced it was making Azure its preferred cloud infrastructure. 
For Microsoft, the ""preferred"" deal concept ensures companies will use more Azure resources, while not forcing them to abandon rival data center environments, such as Amazon Web Services, which could be inconvenient.
Adobe currently uses AWS and its own data center infrastructure. But it's not just adopting Azure to avoid getting locked in to AWS.
""To drive that deep integration with Office, we really need to also make Sign run as first-class solution on Azure,"" Adobe Chief Technology Officer Abhay Parasnis told CNBC. 
And between the two companies, there's more to come. Both companies have benches of artificial intelligence researchers, for one thing.
""We're looking at ways to connect our AI strategy around document intelligence with the Office Graph and the kind of investments Microsoft is making,"" Parasnis said.
Azure held 13.8 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market in the second quarter, while AWS had 30.3 percent, according to Canalys analyst Matthew Ball. (For those wondering about the long tail, Google had 5.9 percent, IBM had 4.8 percent, Salesforce had 3.4 percent, Oracle had 2.9 percent and Alibaba had 2.6 percent, according to the Canalys data.)

 });Temasek Holdings, Singapore's massively influential state-owned investment company, is weighing an investment into Florida-based start-up Magic Leap, according to a new report.
 Bloomberg, citing sources, said on Thursday that Temasek is considering taking part in a new funding round of more than $500 million that could value the start-up close to $6 billion. A source familiar with the company's business confirmed to CNBC that the round is in the works but not closed.
Magic Leap, a virtual and augmented reality start-up, has raised more than $1.3 billion according to the report. It is backed by prominent investors including Jack Ma's Alibaba Group, Alphabet's subsidiary Google and Qualcomm. Both Temasek and Magic Leap declined to comment to Bloomberg.
 The start-up is trying to build a mixed reality platform where virtual images are embedded into normal human vision when seen through a headset. It is similar to the Microsoft HoloLens, and will begin shipping to select testers within 6 months at a price between $1,500 and $2,000, though that could change, Bloomberg reports.
Earlier in February, Business Insider published what it claimed was a photo of a working prototype of Magic Leap's portable augmented reality device. But the start-up's president, CEO and founder, Rony Abovitz, said the photo showed a Magic Leap research and development test rig used to collect room and space data for machine learning work.

 Blockchain technology is on the radar of a number of tech corporations – and IBM is leading the way, according to a study.
 Big Blue has been making considerable steps forward with research and development projects aimed at broadening the scope of distributed ledger technology to include industries other than the financial services.
Last month it announced a partnership with Nestle, Unilever, Wal-Mart and other food giants to trace the movements of food and tackle contamination faster by using the technology.
 According to research firm Juniper Research, the corporation is better positioned than competitor Microsoft as far as its blockchain credentials are concerned.
More than 40 percent of tech executives and leaders in the blockchain sector ranked IBM as top, with only 20 percent saying the same of Microsoft.

 What is Blockchain?   
 7:14  AM ET Thu, 14 Dec 2017 |  04:44 
 A blockchain is a huge decentralized log of data spread across numerous locations. It secures the data through encrypted 'blocks', accessed via a peer-to-peer network.
The purpose of the original blockchain was solely financial, serving as a distributed ledger for bitcoin transactions.
In July, Juniper said that more than half (57%) of the world's large corporations are considering the deployment of their own blockchain solutions.
The race towards building distributed ledger solutions has become increasingly heated, with EY announcing its own platform aimed at securing insurance for the shipping industry earlier this month.

 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella could have worked at Amazon   
 4:08  PM ET Mon, 18 Sept 2017 |  01:02 
 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella could have gone down a very different career path. 
 Nadella has spent almost his entire career working up the ranks at Microsoft. But at one point, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos tried to get him to jump ship, according to a profile of Nadella in Fast Company.
""Early on, Jeff Bezos was trying to recruit him [to Amazon],"" North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a former Microsoft manager, told the magazine. ""It was my job to re-recruit him.""
 While Nadella was being groomed as Burgum's protege, then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer had different plans, Fast Company reports.  Ballmer reportedly wanted Nadella to run Microsoft search engine Bing.
""Steve was very clear,"" Nadella told Fast Company. ""He just said, 'Look, this is the most important challenge I have. I don't think this is maybe even a smart decision for you, but I want you to do it. Think wisely, and choose. And by the way, if you fail, there's no parachute. It's not like I'm going to come and rescue you and put you back into your old job.'""
Though Bing may not have the same glamour as Amazon, Nadella took the challenge — and it's lucky for Microsoft that he did. While Nadella's appointment as CEO was met with some skepticism, shares of Microsoft were trading at all-time high levels on Monday, dating to its IPO in March 1986.

 Here's what should keep Facebook shareholders up at night   
 4:18  PM ET Fri, 22 Sept 2017 |  00:48 
 The power of Facebook advertising — let's say they can identify 2 billion people around the world based on 200 points of data, which allows them to offer advertisers the holy grail of targeting. Now companies know exactly who is seeing their ads — only the ""right"" potential consumers. This is unheard of in the history of the world.
 Facebook's shareholders have been rightfully rewarded for the company's marketing prowess. It now sports a market capitalization of $500 billion – the only two companies worth more are Apple and Microsoft. Exxon, J&J, Google, JP Morgan, Berkshire – they're all worth less.
So it is true that Facebook has an amazing marketing product and it is also true that the world now fully appreciates this fact.
 But what if not everyone agrees to play along? What if this ability to micro-target every living human being to the degree of 200 individual data points is not okay anymore? For example, what if a foreign government — say, Germany — decides that 200 data points is too much information for Facebook to collect and make available about their citizens to advertisers? What if Germany says, ""You know what? This is not okay. From now on, you can only utilize 100 of those 200 data points. We don't want our sovereign citizens targeted to that degree by anyone — dishwashing detergent firms, political parties, special interest groups — it's too much influence.""
Now what if this happens, and Facebook acquiesces so as to stay out of court, and then a month later Japan says they'd like the same thing? And then the Netherlands? And then the state of Florida? And then the city of Las Vegas? And so on? What if the world begins to make the decision that no entity — corporate or otherwise — ought to have the sort of broad, unchecked free reign that Facebook (and to a lesser extent, Google) has enjoyed over the last few years?
Does Facebook face them all down, one after another, to preserve their advertising technology advantage? Or do they willfully comply and water down their programs? In either case, could this conceivably be a positive for shareholders of Facebook stock?
I can't imagine how.
Can you?
Now you might be saying, ""That's not realistic! No one is going to require Facebook to become less good at what they do!""
You'd be wrong. This is absolutely within the realm of possibility, historically speaking. They did it to Microsoft twenty years ago and it's taken the company approximately this entire span of time since to recover. They did it to AT&T back in the day, the irony being that shareholders made a lot more money once all of the component spin-off subsidiaries were given to them. They did it to John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, even though it took almost twenty years to make it through the courts. By the time they were done with him, it was almost like a relief.
Governments that feel threatened or genuinely fear for the safety and/or competitive position of their constituents will absolutely take action if they feel the need to. Uber must now negotiate with the city of London in order to keep operating there beyond the end of September. They'll probably get to stay, but not without concessions. Might some of those concessions include a lightening up of the company's competitive advantages over the black car taxi system that's long held sway in that city?
This week Facebook announced that it will make public all of the ads purchased by Russian interests during the 2016 elections. That's a start. But the bigger question should not be about the content of the ads or the purported sponsors. It should be about how it can be possible that ads like these can be so lethally effective. The answer, of course, is that Facebook has a one-of-a-kind delivery method to ensure direct hits. How will that sit with Congress when they begin to get their heads around this concept. I am convinced that, for the most part, they are until now completely clueless.
If a government decides that there is a such thing as too much influence being held by a corporation, technology giant or otherwise, there is a risk to its shareholders. We do not live and work in some sort of utopian paradise where all progress is universally celebrated and allowed, unmolested, to do what it will, to whom it will, with what information it pleases.
And I'm not sure how many fishing trips and RV rides Mark Zuckerberg has the time to go on, around the world, in order to preserve the company's monopoly on our collective attention.

 Over the past few months, Tesla and SpaceX boss Musk has issued repeated, dire threats warning of a very scary future with artificial intelligence.
Musk says the global race for artificial intelligence will cause World War III and that governments will take AI technology ""at gunpoint"" if necessary. The billionaire tech icon has also says robots will be able to do everything better than humans. And ""AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization"" and poses ""vastly more risk"" than North Korea, according to Musk.

 Gates is not the only tech thought leader to push back against Musk for his rhetoric.
Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is optimistic about a future where AI makes human life better. Zuckerberg calls Musk's warnings of AI ""pretty irresponsible.""
Similarly, John Giannandrea, the senior vice president of engineering at Google in charge of the tech giant's AI efforts has also disapproved of the kind fear mongering Musk has been doing of late.
""I just object to the hype and the sort of sound bites that some people have been making,"" says Giannandrea, speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt SF last week. ""I am definitely not worried about the AI apocalypse.""
Nadella, the third CEO of Microsoft whose new book, ""Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft's Soul and Imagine a Better Future for Everyone,"" is due out Tuesday, says that it is incumbent upon humans to be responsible for the machine systems they create.
""The core AI principle that guides us at this stage is: How do we bet on humans and enhance their capability? There are still a lot of design decisions that get made, even in a self-learning system, that humans can be accountable for,"" Nadella says in conversation with Gates for the WSJ Magazine.
""There's a lot I think we can do to shape our own future instead of thinking, this is just going to happen to us. Control is a choice. We should try to keep that control.""

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a company conference in London in November 2014.
 Microsoft on Monday announced updates to its Azure public cloud that make it a more formidable challenger to market leader Amazon Web Services.
 Microsoft unveiled a piece of hardware full of hard drives that companies can fill up with data before sending it off to Microsoft data centers. Companies would use this service for sending massive amounts of data they want Microsoft to host, but that would be too slow or costly to upload over the internet. AWS did something like that in 2015.
Microsoft is also introducing a service that will ease the migration of databases from on-premises data centers into its cloud, and it will start letting people reserve computing resources for future use — at lower prices than they would ordinarily pay. AWS announced a database migration service in 2015 and reserved instances in 2009.
 And following the 2016 introduction of AWS' Shield service, which stops applications from being overwhelmed by distributed denial-of-service attacks, Microsoft is now coming out with a comparable tool — the same technology that Microsoft uses to keep Office 365 and Xbox Live running.
AWS held 34 percent of the market for cloud infrastructure services in the second quarter, and Azure, its closest competitor, had 11 percent, according to Synergy Research Group. Microsoft has consistently sought to keep up with AWS by matching prices for core computing and storage in Azure, and making its cloud services available from more places around the world alongside AWS.
Earlier this year Alphabet's Google cloud — which had 5 percent of the cloud infrastructure market, according to Synergy — showed off Cloud Dataprep, an app for easily cleaning up data and getting it ready for deep analysis. Now Microsoft is responding with a data cleaning tool of its own that ""learns your data preparation steps as you perform them,"" a Microsoft spokesman wrote in an email.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella
 Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates says that the company's CEO, Satya Nadella, is naturally great at a skill that took him years to learn: how to deliver feedback with empathy. 
 Gates and Nadella spoke to WSJ Magazine in an interview published Monday, a rare chat with two of the three men to ever run Microsoft. 
""Early on we were speed nuts, staying all night [at the office, thinking], 'Oh, you're five percent slower as a programmer? You don't belong here.' It was very hard-core,"" Gates told the magazine, citing his rivalry with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. ""I think as this industry has matured, so has what's expected of a CEO. Satya has a natural ability to work well with lots of people, to tell people they're wrong in a nice way and to let feedback come through to him more than I did.""
 Gates has reclaimed some oversight of Microsoft's products under the leadership of Nadella, who said that Gates has an inimitable way of ""galvanizing"" workers to do their best. Nadella, on the other hand, said that while being ""hard-core"" is still an important part of his job, he thinks humility is the only way to really put himself in his customers' shoes. 
""The reason why I use the word empathy is because the business we are in is to meet the unmet, unarticulated needs of customers. That's what innovation is all about. And there's no way you're going to do that well without having empathy and curiosity,"" Nadella told the magazine.

Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp
 Microsoft on Monday introduced a software bundle for so-called front-line workers like cashiers, truck drivers and factory employees.
 The announcement at Microsoft's Ignite conference in Orlando, Florida, could help the company boost its usage and revenue numbers for some of its most important products at a time when it's dealing with competition from Google's Chrome OS and productivity apps like Google Docs.
Called Microsoft 365 F1, the new offering includes StaffHub, a recently launched app for managing shifts so that employees don't need to call in or stop by the main office to check a weekly schedule printed on a piece of paper.
 It also comes with the Office 365, Windows 10 and Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility and Security suite, which companies use to manage and secure devices. Those products have been sold in other bundles in the past.
But while Microsoft 365 F1 might seem like just the latest attempt to put a new package around existing software, Kirk Koenigsbauer, corporate vice president for Microsoft's Office 365 client applications, suggested it's more than the sum of its parts. 
""Internally we're totally changing the way we work to really revolve around this idea of Microsoft 365 — the Windows, the Office and the Enterprise Mobility and Security teams are planning together, and we're laying out cadences in terms of when we plan to ship together,"" Koenigsbauer said. For one thing, he said, the group decided to integrate the administrative portals for Enterprise Mobility and Security and Office 365.
To make StaffHub more appealing, Microsoft will also be enhancing the app in a few ways. Employees will be able to clock in and clock out from within the app, as well as view tasks that managers have assigned to them.
The push for front-line workers also extends to hardware. Microsoft says Acer, HP, Fujitsu and Lenovo will be coming out with devices that would be well suited for front-line workers. They'll start at $275, making them considerably more affordable than Microsoft's own $999 Surface Laptop, and they'll be running Windows 10 S, the edition that meant to be more secure because it can run apps downloaded only from the Windows Store.
In some cases, though, it might not make sense to equip every last front-line worker at a company with a new HP laptop running Windows 10. 
That's the case at Jackson Family Wines, whose wineries includes Kendall-Jackson. The company recently issued iPhones to its vineyard workers, who are using Office 365 services.
""Their focus is to prune grapes, spray them, take care of them throughout the year and make sure they're producing the plentiful berries that they need for the wine and not working on a Windows 10 machine, if you will,"" said Doug Brown, Jackson Family Wines' director of IT operations.
Managers and associates at the tasting rooms also need to coordinate and be informed of corporate announcements — and that communication happens in StaffHub. ""They're less interested in getting email,"" Brown said.
Microsoft is also doubling down on the education market with a version of Microsoft 365 for education customers that comes with the Microsoft-owned game Minecraft, in addition to StaffHub.

 ""Recently, I actually did switch to an Android phone with a lot of Microsoft software,"" Gates said while speaking on a Fox News segment where he talked about his relationship with Steve Jobs. Gates didn't say which Android phone he's using.
Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system launched several years ago and was the company's attempt to take on iOS and Android. It floundered after several missteps, notably a lack of support from the developer community and Microsoft's botched acquisition of Nokia.
 Gates said he still doesn't use an Apple iPhone. ""No, no iPhone,"" he said.

 During the panel, the executives agreed that artificial intelligence will impact the labor force in a positive way: Namely, by adding more jobs.
Their comments come at a time when artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing market. Roughly $2 billion dollars has been spent on AI advertising just this year, according to the panel's moderator Peter Spande, CRO of Business Insider.
 Jordan Bitterman, CMO of IBM Watson Content and Internet of Things Platform, points to the auto industry as a prime example. ""The automobile, when it first came about, was thought to be putting people out of jobs,"" says Bitterman. ""And, of course, if you were in the horseshoe business, it probably did exactly that.""
However, significantly more jobs were created as a result. ""It created the suburbs. It created the shopping mall. It created the automobile industry obviously, the tire industry. It put people to work building highway system,"" he says.

 Elon Musk: The world's population is accelerating toward collapse and nobody cares   
 12:30  PM ET Thu,  6 July 2017 |  01:01 
 SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly warned against the technology. In July, Musk said that robots would cause job disruption because they would be able to do everything better than humans.
Just last monthhe tweeted, ""If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be.""
However, his fear-mongering has received backlash from others in the tech space, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.
""The so-called control problem that Elon is worried about isn't something that people should feel is imminent,"" says Gates, according to the transcript of an interview he gave the  Wall Street Journal. ""We shouldn't panic about it.""
In a Facebook live stream Zuckerberg said, ""I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios — I just, I don't understand it. It's really negative and, in some ways, I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.""
 In a separate Facebook post, Zuckerberg said that he remains optimistic about the benefits of artificial intelligence. He's not the only one.
Rob Wilk, vice president and head of North America search sales at Microsoft, tells the panel that there are certain circumstances where you have to take an ethical stance on artificial intelligence. But, he says, the benefits still far outweigh the risks.
""Technology can be used for good or technology can be used for bad,"" he says.
Wilk adds that there is an inherent moral responsibility that large companies like Microsoft, Google and IBM take on because they have access to this much information. He says that these organizations must use the technology ""in a way that's good for people.""
However, in response to the ongoing doomsday rhetoric surrounding artificial intelligence, the Microsoft exec says that it's important to take a step back and look at reality.
""We actually see some really good positive uses of AI,"" says Wilk. He points to a Microsoft product called Seeing AI, which is built for those who are hard of seeing.
Imagine that you're visually impaired and at a restaurant, he says. The app, which was built by visually impaired engineers, can read the different menu items for you.
""So [A.I.] can be used for a lot of really good scenarios but they're just not as sexy as the more frightening ones,"" says Wilk.

Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft Corp
 Satya Nadella is the third CEO of Microsoft. He's also a husband and a father of special-needs kids. He's an immigrant.
 And he's pretty close to doing something that, until he took the job just over three and a half years ago, most people in tech – heck, most people at Microsoft – thought was impossible.
That near-impossible task is a cultural revival of a once-dominant tech giant that was losing its grip on its soul. Under Nadella's leadership morale is up, and so is product quality and the stock price. The question is whether all of that can stick.
 Satya sat down with me at the Nasdaq Marketsite in Times Square in New York, where he stopped through to promote his new book, ""Hit Refresh,"" about the revival he's attempting at Microsoft. The conversation for my Fortt Knox podcast offers a fresh look at one of the most influential technology leaders in the world today, who's engineering a cultural rebirth few thought possible – while also being a dad who faces some unique challenges helping his kids reach their full potential.
To do it all, he's made some decisions that go directly against popular wisdom. Some highlights:
 Downgrading his green card
 As a young engineer at Microsoft, Nadella faced a quandary. He was ready to start a family – but with his green card, he wouldn't be able to bring his wife Anu over to the United States. An immigration lawyer at Microsoft suggested a move that seemed ridiculous: Give up his coveted green card, and get an H1-B visa, which allows spouses to enter the U.S. I asked him about the story he recounts in the book, and how it influences the way he looks at today's immigration debate.
""A comprehensive immigration reform—that again, speaks to our interests as a nation, what makes us stronger, what makes us more competitive, I think is much needed,"" Nadella said. ""The idea that you have to give up your green card to get an H1-B is, in retrospect, silly. And so therefore let us in fact take the reform so that it works for us, both our security but as well as our competitiveness.""

 postLoadFunctions.wildcard1_init = function(){
 var iframe=document.getElementById(""frame"");
 $(window).on(""orientationchange"",function(){
 iframe.src=iframe.src;
 });
 }
 Showing his hunger
 When he was one of several candidates to be the next CEO, one of the Microsoft board members who would pick the successor pulled him aside. If you want the job, he said, you have to act more like you're really hungry for it. Outgoing CEO Steve Ballmer dismissed that notion, saying it's too late to act like a different person now.
""It was not like we were sitting around, thinking that Steve is going to retire. So it was a shock. And the board did the right thing, which is they looked far and wide,"" Nadella said. ""When they came and talked to me and they said, 'Do you wanna be CEO,' I was honest. I said, 'Only if you want me to be CEO.'""
That goes against all the advice in the business books, self-help books, and self-esteem books. But Nadella wasn't lacking in confidence – he was just bringing a different style, a different humility, to the job.
 Leading with empathy
 One of the more personal angles in Hit Refresh – and in my conversation with Nadella – concerns his journey as a father. His son Zain was born with cerebral palsy, a challenge that forced him to change the way he looks at relationships not only at home, but also at work.
""A few years went by and then I realized nothing happened to me. Something happened to Zain,"" Nadella said. ""What's my responsibility as a father? I think that was perhaps one of, you know, the big hit refresh moments when I look back for me personally, that has influenced. And so, I think it's our life's experience that then leads into work, and work's experience that leads into life. And it's one of those things where, it has to be lived. We can't be taught about it.""
Today's corporate cultures can sometimes glorify a take-no-prisoners approach; but that's not the only way.

In fact, millennials voted it the No. 1 company they're most excited to work, according to a recent survey by SurveyMonkey.
 The tech company, which employs approximately 73,000 people in the U.S. and over 125,000 people worldwide, receives thousands of applicants a day.
""We're always, always hiring,"" Chuck Edward, Microsoft's head of global talent acquisition, tells CNBC Make It. ""We don't screen people out. We screen people in.""
 Here are three skills the HR chief says prospective candidates should highlight in an interview to score a coveted position at the company:
 1. Show that you have a growth mindset
 What started as a company focusing solely on computer programming has now become a technological behemoth that creates new gadgets and apps like artificial intelligence for the visually impaired.
 var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];
 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 Therefore, it should come as no surprise that Microsoft favors applicants who, Edward says, ""embrace the future.""
He explains that this growth mindset is fostered from the top down, starting with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

 Edwards says that applicants looking to score a job at the company should show how they have progressed within a role or within a company.
 2. Demonstrate a customer obsession
 The HR exec says that a ""true customer obsession"" is paramount at Microsoft. So how can one illustrate this? Edward suggests highlighting jobs where you've had a client-facing role, such as consulting.
He also recommends focusing on instances in which you have taken on ""more challenges,"" ""gotten things done through others"" and shown how you have solved problems for customers in the past.

A view of the new Microsoft Surface Laptop following a Microsoft launch event, May 2, 2017 in New York City.
 Notably, a customer-centric approach has been important to Microsoft for some time. For example, Nadella told Fortune in 2016 that he always reserves time to meet with children. That's in part because they are the next generation of customers and because it ""keeps him grounded.""
He also attends tech summits because it gives him a chance to gain necessary insight on how customers are using Microsoft products, according to Fortune.
 3. Prove that you're a learner
 Edward says that the concept of learning, rather than knowing, is a vital part of the company's ethos and has been modeled and reinforced time and again. He calls this Microsoft's ""secret sauce.""
""How can we be convinced that you're a learner?"" he asks. More importantly, ""How do you get others to join you and learn with you?""
Now, obviously, a person applying to work in quantum computing or AI will need a ""classic skill set,"" says Edward. But ""not everyone will have every skill."" That's where this ability to learn comes into play, he says.

 Edward says that your resume should also describe your past leadership experience and how you have ""achieved results, progressed and learned.""
Other crucial skills the company looks for include the ability to create clarity and collaborate with team members.
The HR chief explains that these skills show aptitude, which people from different backgrounds possess. This widens the demographic of people that the company employs, he says.
""It's not always tech expertise,"" says Edward, ""[but rather] passion for what tech can do. That opens up a huge palette of people we can hire.""

 When analysts ""throw in the towel"" on stocks, Cramer hates it   
 7:12  PM ET Thu,  5 Oct 2017 |  00:57 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer actually gets worried when Wall Street analysts ""throw in the towel"" on given stocks for one reason or another.
 ""Why do these towel-throwers scare me? You might think it's always a good thing when the bears surrender or the bulls lose patience, but if the stock market does take a downturn — by the way, there will always be a downturn eventually — there will be no upgrade cushions to stabilize things. The upgrades will have already happened,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""If anything, these analysts who lack the intestinal fortitude are more likely to downgrade once we get slammed with that sell-off.""
Cramer started with the Sherwin-Williams, the large paint manufacturer that surprised the Street with its acquisition of competitor Valspar in 2016.
 Initially, analysts were skeptical about the $11.3 billion deal due to worries that the housing market was peaking and construction was slowing.
But after the stock came back and rallied 40 percent, a Bank of America-Merrill Lynch analyst that had been negative on the paint maker gave Sherwin a double upgrade, to ""buy"" from ""sell.""
Initially, the analyst cited Sherwin's high valuation, acquisition of Valspar, potentially peaking margins and slowing volume as reasons to sell. But in his upgrade, he said that the stock's valuation was still high, but the other concerns no longer held weight.
""Wait a second, so the acquisition's now good, the margins aren't peaking, there's no slowing volume?"" Cramer asked. ""Put it all together and this upgrade is a genuine towel throw. It's a total capitulation of the 'I can't take it anymore' variety.""
As Bank of America-Merrill Lynch's equity research is held for clients, a spokesperson for the bank declined CNBC's request for comment.
The second ""towel throw"" Cramer noticed was Canaccord Genuity's upgrade of Microsoft on Thursday. The firm cited Microsoft's productivity, position in eSports, marketing and Azure cloud platform as factors that would contribute to the company's success.
""When I read the report, it was almost written by Captain Obvious,"" Cramer said. ""The only thing they left out was CEO Satya Nadella's cool black t-shirt look.""
One paragraph of the report told Cramer right away that this was a ""towel throw"" upgrade.
The analyst wrote, ""We had hoped for a random correction in Microsoft shares or a correction in the overall stock market. Neither happened.""
Cramer hates upgrades like these because they don't end up giving investors much value. Research that comes out after a major move in a stock or because a stock didn't end up declining means investors probably already missed most of the gains, he said.
""While I'm not bearish on the overall market, I have to admit that when you see this kind of research, you know that you're no longer early to a move. You are late,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Remember that, and remember that when we do go down, none of these towel-throwers will be able to make an impact with their upgrades. They've already happened. And that's why these upgrades are a shame, not to mention a ridiculous waste of paper.""

 Microsoft's growth could get a boost from its latest Xbox launch as well as its exploration of the growing esports industry, according to one Wall Street analyst.
 Canaccord Genuity upgraded Microsoft shares to buy from hold Wednesday, noting that the Xbox maker could give more credibility to the budding world of esports, which is centered on video game tournaments and already attracts thousands of participants and viewers.
""In our view, this is both an area of future internal development and prospective M&A,"" wrote analyst Richard Davis. ""With regard to M&A, perhaps Microsoft could become the Ticketmaster of eSports, maybe they could run leagues.""
 Microsoft is set to release its latest generation of Xbox, called the Xbox One X, in November. Davis added that Microsoft's office productivity programs and its cloud computing platform, Azure, could also accelerate growth.
Shares of Microsoft rose 0.5 percent shortly after Thursday's market open. The company's stock is up 20 percent year to date through Wednesday.
The analyst raised his price target for Microsoft shares to $86, which is 15 percent higher than Wednesday's closing price. His old target was $76.
Esports are turning a lot of heads lately. Industry revenue is expected to hit $1.1 billion in 2019, and roughly 76 percent of esports fans claim the virtual tournaments are overtaking their time spent watching traditional sporting events, according to research firm Newzoo.
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft recently made headlines by purchasing one of seven teams for the Overwatch League, a popular online game produced by Activision Blizzard.
""For brands, media, and entertainment companies, esports provides a chance to capitalize on the favorite pastime of digital natives and Millennials: playing games and watching game content,"" Newzoo's analysts wrote in the firm's annual esports market report.

 Microsoft is no longer developing new hardware or features for Windows 10 Mobile, the smartphone version of its flagship operating system, effectively killing off its presence in the handset market.
 In a series of Tweets, Joe Belfiore, Microsoft's corporate vice president of Windows, said the U.S. technology giant will continue to release bug fixes and security updates, but not any new hardware.
Belfiore said Microsoft has tried ""very hard"" to incentivize app developers, even by paying them, but admitted the volume of users on Windows 10 Mobile is too low.

 Microsoft has struggled in the mobile market over the past few years. It acquired Nokia's mobile business in 2013, a move that has since been seen as a failure. In 2015, it took a $7.6 billion write-down on its Nokia business and axed thousands of jobs.
Google's Android operating system and Apple's iOS dominate the smartphone market. Windows Mobile had a 0.3 percent global market share at the end of 2016, according to Gartner.
Belfiore admitted that he no longer users a Windows phone. Microsoft founder Bill Gates recently said that he had switched to Android.
Microsoft's recent strategy in the mobile space has focused around bringing its software products to Android and iOS. It recently brought its Edge web browser to iOS and Belfiore said an Android version is in the works.

 Microsoft and General Electric (GE) have entered into a 15-year power purchase agreement in Ireland, it was announced Monday. 
 The deal means that the tech giant will purchase all the wind energy produced at GE's new, 37 megawatt (MW) Tullahennel wind farm in County Kerry. 
Each turbine at the site will have a battery integrated into it to help generate ""valuable data"" relating to energy storage, GE said. This will allow technicians to test how the batteries can be utilized to ""capture and store"" excess energy and send it back to the grid as and when required.
 ""This partnership with Microsoft expands GE's considerable presence and investment in Ireland, where we already employ over 1,500 people and, in particular, in the renewable energy sector,"" Andres Isaza, GE Renewable Energy's chief commercial officer, said in a statement.
Wind is now ""one of the most competitive sources of electricity on the market today,"" Isaza added.
The announcement comes a week after Belgian offshore wind farm developer Parkwind said it would become a strategic partner in the Oriel Wind Farm in the northwest Irish Sea. The proposed 55-turbine project is set to be located 22 kilometers off the coast of Dundalk.
With a capacity of 330 MW, it will be able to supply green energy to 250,000 Irish homes, according to Oriel Windfarm Limited.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a company conference in London in November 2014.
 For the second time in recent months, Amazon and Microsoft are teaming up in artificial intelligence, with Google on the sidelines for now.
 On Thursday the two companies rolled out new tools that will make it easier for developers to use open-source artificial intelligence software. This follows the companies' move in August to let its virtual assistants Alexa and Cortana talk with each other as needed.
Getting into the technical weeds, developers can use Gluon, a Python-based application programming interface, to more easily work with MXNet, the AI framework backed by public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services. And in the near future Gluon will make it easier for developers to use the Cognitive Toolkit, the framework that Microsoft open-sourced in 2015. The two companies are publishing the specifications for Gluon so that other frameworks can adopt it, too.
 Google is the elephant in the room here. Google open-sourced the TensorFlow AI framework in 2015, and it has since become very popular among researchers -- considerably more popular than the Cognitive Toolkit and MXNet:
 https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/915366704401719296
 Notably, Google is not among the companies promoting Gluon at this point. (Google declined to comment.) People who wish to use TensorFlow might find it easier to do that with a Google-backed Python API called Keras.
The announcement comes a few months after Apple introduced the Core ML software that's meant to help developers incorporate AI into iOS apps. Apple also released tools for converting models based on other frameworks into its Core ML format.
""We believe it is important for the industry to work together and pool resources to build technology that benefits the broader community,"" Eric Boyd, corporate vice president of Microsoft's AI and Research group, is quoted as saying in a statement. ""This is why Microsoft has collaborated with AWS to create the Gluon interface and enable an open AI ecosystem where developers have freedom of choice.""

Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg
 Former Microsoft exec Steven Sinofsky knows what Facebook is going through.
 He was at the giant when it was the undisputed leader of the tech industry, and when sentiment turned against the company and everybody — from federal regulators to competitors to the press — was attacking it.
Now Facebook is going through a similar phase. A couple years ago, Mark Zuckerberg was viewed as a wonder-kid genius who had built a tech company worth hundreds of billions in less than a decade, and was making a well-studied turn into philanthropy.
 Then came the 2016 presidential election. Facebook users watched as their feeds were filled with polarizing political posts, including fake news and ads, including some that the company later admitted were bought by Russians in an attempt to influence the election.
Now, the company is being forced to testify before various committees on Capitol Hill about the Russian ads, and Zuckerberg is getting raked over the coals for tone-deaf moves like showing flood-stricken Puerto Rico to demonstrate its virtual reality platform. All the while, commentators slam it for being too powerful and insufficiently apologetic, calling it one of the ""Four Horsemen"" or ""Frightful Five.""

Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg
 Sinofsky captures the disorienting feeling Facebook employees probably have right now, where they thought they were on top of the world and can't quite figure out why everybody suddenly seems to hate them.
As he put it, ""We were just trying to make software. The more ppl said we were trying to be bad and do harm the wider the gap became. Surreal to us."" 
But he says this is a normal part of the growing-up process for companies, and he offered some recommendations on how Facebook could handle it using a framework called Tuckman's stages of group development.
In the end, he's confident Facebook and other social networks will make it through the other side.

 But he says he learned a critical lesson about leadership not during his time as an executive in the tech industry, but from his experience playing high school sports in India. As a junior at Hyderabad Public School, Nadella played cricket, the popular bat-and-ball game often compared to baseball. 
His team had a great reputation, and some of his teammates went on to play the sport professionally. Nadella himself was ""obsessed"" with the sport, the CEO said in a recent interview with The New York Times' Rebecca Blumenstein.
 But he wasn't always good at it.
What happened during one particular match taught him a key lesson about success that he still carries with him today.

 ""I was a 'bowler,' or a pitcher,""  Nadella says, ""and I was serving up real trash one day.""
His pitches were giving the opposite team easy points, and his team was falling behind. So the captain called him off the field and stepped in to take his place. Nadella stood on the sidelines, thinking he wasn't going to get a chance to play again in the game.
But after a few rounds, the captain gave Nadella another shot to get back on the field and redeem himself. 
""I've always asked myself, 'Why did he do that?'"" Nadella says. ""He could have just replaced me and moved on.""
According to the CEO, the team captain knew that by taking a player out of the game and keeping him out, he would have discouraged him and chipped away at his will to succeed. 
""I did much better during the second half of that game,"" he says, ""and then I had a pretty decent season.""
That particular match, and the second chance he was given to succeed, taught Nadella that when it comes to boosting someone's performance, encouragement is the best strategy.

 ""That to me was one of those very subtle but very key leadership lessons,"" the CEO says. ""You can't take your key people out if they fail the first time, [or] pass harsh judgement without understanding the context.""
Nadella isn't the only leader who says that sports helped shape his career. Billionaire Richard Branson says that playing tennis taught him the ability to move on from past failures and stay focused on the future.
In fact, a Cornell University study found that playing sports helps young people build their leadership skills and boosts their confidence. One 2013 Ernst & Young survey found that 96 percent of women in C-suite roles played sports.

 Microsoft built treehouse workspaces for its employees   
 3:03  PM ET Fri, 13 Oct 2017 |  00:39 
 Microsoft employees are taking to the trees.
 The company has built treehouses, with embedded tech, on its Redmond campus to serve as meeting spaces and a more casual work environment. 
""With their workspace turned inside out and meetings taking place up in the foliage employees are figuring out how to rethink what working looks like,"" the company said in a blog post.

 More than 12 feet off the ground, the treehouses feature charred-wood walls, skylights, at least one gas fireplace, Wi-Fi and hidden electrical outlets. Employees can even grab a bite at an outdoor extension of the indoor cafeteria.
The ""more Hobbit than HQ"" treehouses are designed by Pete Nelson of the TV show ""Treehouse Masters"" and are part of Microsoft's growing ""outdoor districts.""
The company touts the professional benefits of working in nature — greater creativity, focus and happiness — but honestly, the treehouses are just plain cool.

 ""Microsoft has something unique that most companies located within large metropolitan areas don't have: a 500-acre campus nestled in the woods, with greenspace and wildlife galore,"" the company blog said. 
Two of the three treehouses are complete and ready for use, and a third will be finished later this year.

Penny Pritzker
 Microsoft on Monday revealed the latest nominees for its board of directors: Penny Pritzker, the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Obama, and Arne Sorenson, president and CEO of Marriott International.
 Pritzker and Sorenson, both 58, would be joining as activist investor Mason Morfit -- who joined the board shortly after Satya Nadella became Microsoft's CEO -- gets ready to leave in November. Pritzker would give the board more diversity, Microsoft pointed out in the proxy statement announcing the news.
Morfit's departure from the board was expected; PepsiCo CFO Hugh Johnston was announced as his replacement earlier this year.
 Pritzker has previously served on Hyatt Hotels' board, while Sorenson has previously been a Wal-Mart board member.
Microsoft shareholders will be able to vote on the nominations; the annual shareholders meeting will take place in Bellevue, Wash., on November 29. 
Microsoft's current board relied on the search firm Spencer Stuart to find its next members.

New Mixed Reality experiences are supported in the update.
 Microsoft rolled out its big new Windows 10 Fall Creators Update at 1 pm Eastern today.
 It includes plenty of new features, but the biggest is support for new Mixed Reality headsets that are sold by Microsoft partners including Samsung, Dell, Lenovo, HP and Acer. They're Microsoft's big take on virtual reality and provide a new way to interact with software, including games and apps. Users can virtually step inside Windows to take advantage of certain 360-degree experiences while wearing the special headsets.
The Windows 10 Fall Creators update also adds quick access to Skype and Mail contacts, which can be pinned to the taskbar at the lower right-hand side of the screen. With a single click, you can begin to chat or Skype call someone.
 Microsoft also added new features to Cortana — you can now use the voice assistant to shut down or restart your computer — additional security functions, new changes to its Edge browser and more. 
Windows 10 users can find the update by searching for ""Windows Update"" from their computer and clicking ""Check for updates.""

 });Imagine this: You're seeking a new job and have scored interviews at different companies. You don't want to waste your time interviewing for a position that won't pay what you require. Should you inquire about salary during the interview process?
 Chuck Edward, Microsoft's head of global talent acquisition, says to go for it.
""Absolutely ask about salary,"" he tells CNBC Make It. ""[At Microsoft], we're very mindful of being competitive. It's very fair to ask.""
 The HR exec bucks the current trend in which applicants wait for the employer to bring up salary at the very end of the interview process.
Edward explains that knowing the salary upfront is important because money is a key deciding factor when contemplating whether to accept a job offer. Knowing how much a company is willing to offer saves both sides time and effort.

 });
 Edward notes that from a legal standpoint, interviewers cannot discuss salary in some states. But for the most part, he says, bringing up salary in the beginning of the interview process is fair game.
The HR exec adds that this is particularly notable at Microsoft, which touts its transparency during the hiring process.
""We are very transparent and hold ourselves accountable,"" says the head of global talent.

 LinkedIn's global head of talent Brendan Browne agrees that salary is an important discussion to have. However, he says that it's really all about timing. He advises interviewees wait to have the ""salary talk"" later down the line and says that it should not be brought up in the first interview.
Browne warns that bringing up pay to early and to frequently may be a turnoff for hiring managers. Although the level of pay offered can make or break whether you decide to work for a company, Browne says that you shouldn't make it seem like it's the sole reason you want to score the position.
He explains that first and foremost, the employer wants to make sure that you're a good fit for the company. Browne touches on his own interview experiences at LinkedIn.
""We pay well,"" he says.""But what keeps people here is helping us execute on very important decisions.""
He adds that when applicants seem overeager in discussing salary right off the bat, he often responds by saying, ""If that's the most important thing, this may not be the right place for you.""
Microsoft backs up this the rhetoric with their hiring approach. When interviewing, says Edward, the company looks for core skills across various industries.
This allows them to hire top talent that can lead the business through a digital, people and cultural transformation.
Notably, he says, ""We don't screen people out. We screen people in.""

47,2017-10-18,"Mohawk tribe sues Microsoft, Amazon for patent infringement  Right now might be a good time to go long the NASDAQ 100  Mohawk Tribe sues Microsoft, Amazon for patent infringement  ","Harriet Taylor | CNBC
Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Chief Eric Thompson next to the Saint Lawrence River in upstate New York. The tribe aims to diversify its economy through patent partnerships.
 The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which captured headlines last month for its unusual patent deal with drugmaker Allergan, is doubling down in the patent space, Wednesday filing lawsuits against Microsoft and Amazon claiming patent infringement.
 The tribe is a co-plaintiff with small tech firm SRC Labs, which claims the tech giants have been infringing its patents on data processing technologies for years. The company and the tribe are seeking damages and royalties.
SRC transferred the patents to the tribe in early August, a month before the tribe's partnership with Allergan captured national headlines. Native American tribes possess sovereign immunity to patent challenges through a system known as inter partes review, and the partnerships with both Allergan and SRC are designed to shield the patents from those challenges.
 The Allergan partnership drew backlash from at least nine members of Congress, with one, Sen. Claire McCaskill, introducing legislation seeking to abrogate tribal sovereign immunity in this context.
Allergan said it struck the deal with the tribe to avoid the ""double jeopardy"" of defending its patents, on the blockbuster eye drug Restasis, in both the federal court system and through IPR challenges from generic-drug makers. Monday, a federal court judge invalidated the patents. Allergan said it will appeal.
The partnership with the SRC is designed to protect the patents from a counter-challenge from Microsoft and Amazon through the IPR system. Critics of IPR say it can tie patent holders up in perpetual legal limbo as challengers file repeated complaints, whereas patent challenges through federal courts are decisive. Proponents of IPR say it's vital for dismantling bad patents.
The tribe says its patent partnerships are part of its efforts to economically diversify, noting gaming revenue from a casino it operates has leveled off in recent years, and that it has significant health and economic challenges in its community. In the Allergan partnership, the pharmaceutical company paid the tribe $13.75 million after transferring the patent rights and then licensing them back exclusively.
The terms of the deal with SRC weren't immediately known.
""To overcome these economic disadvantages, the tribe took steps to diversify its economy with investments in innovative business and various enterprises to foster jobs and entrepreneurship,"" the tribe said in its complaint against Microsoft, filed Wednesday morning in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Amazon complaint was filed in the same court.
The tribe also said it's creating a technology and innovation center to promote modernization of its businesses, create revenue and jobs and ""promote the education of Mohawks in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math.""
Microsoft and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

48,2017-10-20,A top Microsoft HR exec says you should apply to jobs in these 2 industries  ,"Companies like Microsoft are working hard to secure top talent for new roles. But what are two of the most in-demand industries with available jobs right now?
 Cloud computing and artificial intelligence, says Chuck Edward, Microsoft's head of global talent acquisition, in an interview with CNBC Make It.
And you don't have to work on the technical side of those industries either, he says. You can work in consultative sales, data science and analytics to help customers or nab a job marketing cloud computing, he explains.
 The cloud computing and artificial intelligence industries have been making headlines recently. Just last week Microsoft and Amazon teamed up to roll out tools that are expected to make it easier for developers to use open-source artificial intelligence software.
In August, the companies teamed up to let their respective virtual assistants, Alexa and Cortana, talk with each other.

 There's also been an influx of jobs in both industries, especially at Microsoft. An ""artificial intelligence"" keyword search on the company's career page brings up 469 results (and that's in the U.S. alone). Plus, they're not all technical roles.
A quick skim of the most recent positions shows openings for a financial analyst in the artificial intelligence and research division and another role for an attorney focused on artificial intelligence solutions.
In fact, self-made billionaire Mark Cuban predicts that the world's first trillionaires will be entrepreneurs working in the artificial intelligence industry.
""The world's first trillionaires are going to come from somebody who masters AI and all its derivatives and applies it in ways we never thought of,"" Cuban said at the SXSW Conference and Festivals in March.
Cloud computing has also been at the forefront of Microsoft's business plan. In July, the company's collection of cloud apps hit a new revenue milestone.
A keyword search for ""cloud computing"" on the tech giant's career site brings up 500 pages. Jobs range from cloud support engineer to business program manager.

 Although certain positions do require ""classic skill sets,"" says Edward, the company practices differentiated hiring and seeks applicants who can show that they are learners.
""Not everyone will have every skill,"" he says. ""The ability to learn, collaborate, create clarity ... that's aptitude that people from all different backgrounds can have.""
The head of global talent acquisition adds that it's not always about tech expertise, but rather a passion for what tech can do for society.
Most importantly, says Edward, show that ""you're curious, you're read up and you have an affinity for the company.""
""I'm open about how [job seekers] come in,"" he says, ""but come in with knowledge about the company.""
Edward adds that one of the main questions Microsoft asks itself is, ""How do you hit refresh? How do you honor the past and embrace the future?""
The key to doing that, he says, is by hiring people with a ""growth mindset.""

Thousands of job seekers apply to open positions at the company each day, but just a fraction make it to the interview phase. So once you get to that round, it's vital that you stand out among your competitors in order to snag the job.
 The best way to do that is by asking challenging and thoughtful questions, says Chuck Edward, Microsoft's head of global talent acquisition.
Not only is this the No. 1 way to impress him, says Edward, but he's often pleasantly surprised by the questions interviewees ask.
 ""People should really be prepared with questions that have depth and rigor,"" Edward tells CNBC Make It. ""Really show that curiosity.""
Asking quality questions doesn't just help you stand out from the pack, says the Microsoft exec, it also makes the interview more fun and engaging. Why? Because it forces the interviewer to really think about the company in new ways in determining how best to answer your question, says Edward.

 This opportunity to ask questions typically happens toward the very end of the interview, so it can either hurt or propel your chance of getting the job, says CNBC contributor Suzy Welch.
In fact, she says that the questions you ask the interviewer should show two things: that you've been listening and that you think big.
Welch adds that you should avoid questions like ""what will a typical day look like for me?"" because they won't help you stand out and have likely already been covered.
Instead, she says, you should dig deeper into a part of the job description or better yet, inquire about a new product or initiative the company just rolled out.
These types of questions show your potential employer that you are already looking to the future and invested in what the company is doing.
""Show in a positive way that you're excited about the future and that a part of your brain is already there,"" says Welch.

From left Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg listen during a meeting with technology industry leaders at Trump Tower in New York, NY on Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2016.
 The busiest week of the earnings season is here, and there are 10 companies investors are betting will top Wall Street's expectations.
 CNBC used Estimize, which pools thousands of estimates from real investors and traders, to sort through the many companies reporting over the next week and find the ones where this group had higher expectations than the standard Wall Street consensus estimate from analysts.
About a third of the S&P 500 is expected to have reported quarterly earnings by the end of the week. These companies include tech giants Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Twitter and e-commerce behemoth Amazon. They are also among the companies expected to beat Wall Street earnings forecasts, according to estimates from Estimize.

 All of these companies, except for Amazon, has a history of topping Wall Street's estimates, too.

 Dow member Microsoft, scheduled to report Thursday after the bell, will report earnings of 78 cents a share, five cents higher than the Street's consensus estimate, according to Estimize. The tech giant also has a history of topping Street expectations 75 percent of the time, according to Estimize.
KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brent Bracelin said he expects Microsoft to post strong quarterly results ""led by the continuation of robust Azure and Office 365 adoption trends.""
""The commercial cloud annualized run-rate is on pace to exceed the $20B goal set back in 2015, either this quarter or next, on 45% y/y growth,"" Bracelin said in a note Sunday. 
Bracelin has an overweight rating and an $82 price target on Microsoft. The stock traded near $79 on Monday and is up about 28 percent this year.
Amazon is also expected to top Wall Street expectations, but one word of caution: The company's earnings beat estimates just 46 percent of the time, according to Estimize. The e-commerce giant will report earnings per share of 12 cents, while Wall Street expects a loss of 2 cents a share, according to Estimize.
Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson, expects the company to post a strong beat as sales from Amazon Web Services grow.
""Historically, the performance of AWS has often had the most impact on its share price, because it is generating the fastest sales growth of its three operating segments (North America, International, and AWS) and the highest margin of the three,"" Forte said in a note to clients Thursday, adding he expects AWS revenue to grow 41.5 percent year over year.
Forte has a buy rating and a $997 price target on the stock. Amazon shares traded near $971 on Monday and are up nearly 30 percent in 2017. Amazon is scheduled to report Thursday after the bell.
Google parent Alphabet and Twitter will also beat the Street, according to Estimize. Both stocks are up 25.2 percent and 7.6 percent this year respectively. Twitter will report Thursday before the open, and Alphabet will report after the close Thursday.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers his keynotes at the company’s flagship technology and business conference -- Future Decoded 2017 in Mumbai, India.
 Microsoft is opening its first Mixed Reality capture studios in San Francisco and London, allowing developers and creators to create holograms from real life objects. Microsoft has been using its own studio at its Redmond headquarters to capture Buzz Aldrin, Reggie Watts, Max Frost, and Cirque Du Soleil performances and bring them into virtual reality and augmented reality holograms.
 The new studios in San Francisco, London, and Redmond will allow third parties to create holograms that can be used on regular 2D screens, a HoloLens device, or even Microsoft's new Windows Mixed Reality (VR) headsets. Microsoft will be licensing these studios, and it's likely to be an expensive process to capture items as holograms.
Microsoft is pitching these studios more to producers, musicians, athletes, and dancers. The software giant is also expanding its Mixed Reality Academy program to San Francisco, with a range of workshops designed to teach the basics of developing apps and experiences for VR and HoloLens headsets.
 Microsoft's new studios come just as the augmented reality wars between Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Facebook begin. Tech companies are trying to bring some type of AR experience mainstream, and a tight integration of hardware and software will be key to convince consumers that mixed reality computing is the next major shift beyond PCs, laptops, and smartphones.

 });There are many things to consider when looking for a new job. But Chuck Edward, Microsoft's head of global talent acquisition, says there are two company traits that you should prioritize.
 ""Pay attention to the purpose and culture of the company,"" he tells CNBC Make It. ""That's the differentiator given the state of the country right now.""
In recent months, business leaders have been vocal about key political and global issues.
 One example is Silicon Valley's swift response to President Trump's transgender military ban in July. Tech titans, like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, all spoke out in opposition to the transgender military block.
Immigration reform has also been another hot-button issue among tech companies. After the Supreme Court cleared the way for parts of Trump's contentious travel ban to take effect in June, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Lyft Co-founder all spoke out against the immigration order.

 });
 Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella admonished the travel ban in an interview with CNBC's Squawk Alley. In the interview, Nadella discusses his background as a U.S. immigrant and explains that he's a product of the ""enlightened American immigration policy that let me come here and live the dream.""

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addresses shareholders during the company's shareholders meeting Dec. 3, 2014, in Bellevue, Wash.
 ""But it's not just about skilled immigration. We also need to stand up for being the last place of hope for most people,"" Nadella adds. ""That's what, again, drives America's uniqueness and we should never give it up.""
According to a  study by the survey development platform SurveyMonkey,  65 percent of millennials say they'd rather work for an organization whose mission they believe in than a company that pays a lot. Business leaders are picking up on this.
In February, Zuckerberg wrote a public  manifesto in which he expressed Facebook's vision for a global and connected world. His overarching vision has given the social media giant the ability to produce new products like virtual reality headsets and tackle issues like dealing with hate speech.
Meanwhile, Microsoft's company culture focuses on transformation, says Edward. Specifically, cultural, people and digital transformations. This means hiring top talent by screening in rather than screening out, he says.

 Edward explains that Microsoft focuses on what skills a potential employee can bring to the company instead of looking for reasons why the applicant shouldn't be hired.
The tech company also values diversity, says the HR exec, so the company looks at a range of skills when reviewing applicants in order to bring in a wider array of talent.
""We want to be diverse and inclusive so we can appeal to people all over the world with our products,"" says the head of talent acquisition.
But regardless of the company you decide to work, Edward says, ""realize that there's power in choice.""

 Microsoft shares higher after third-quarter earnings beat   
 7:39  PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 |  01:00 
 Microsoft stock was up more than 4 percent on Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter of its 2018 fiscal year, which ended on September 30. 
 EPS: Excluding certain items, 84 cents vs. 72 cents as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue:  $24.54 billion vs. $23.56 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.   
Perhaps the company's biggest achievement in this quarter is exceeding its self-imposed goal of a $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate for its commercial cloud business -- which includes the Azure cloud, the Office 365 subscription-based application suite and Dynamics 365 apps for customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning. The company came up with a $20.4 billion commercial cloud run rate for the quarter, according to the company's earnings statement.
 KeyBanc analysts Brent Bracelin, Clarke Jeffries and Alyssa Johnson noted earlier this week that they were expecting the milestone either this quarter or the next one. The annualized run rate figure is calculated by multiplying revenue for the last month of the quarter by 12.
""Reaching $20 billion would imply the commercial cloud mix could cross over 20 percent of revenue for the first time in 1Q18, up from 5 percent in early 2015,"" the KeyBanc analysts wrote. The annualized run rate figure is calculated by multiplying revenue for the last month of the quarter by 12.
 #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(""dw-chart"");$(window).on(""orientationchange"",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});});
 The company beat analysts' expectations in all three of its business segments, according to StreetAccount.
Revenue from Azure was up 90 percent year over year, and commercial revenue for Office 365 subscriptions was up 42 percent. (As a whole, Microsoft's revenue was up 12 percent.) Stifel analysts Brad Reback and Adam Borg were expecting Azure -- which is larger than Google's cloud and second only to Amazon Web Services -- to generate $1.3 billion in revenue, which would have been up 90 percent year over year.
In keeping with previous quarters, Azure compute usage more than doubled in the quarter, CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on a conference call after the earnings release.
 PiperJaffray analysts Alex Zukin, Scott Wilson and Taylor Reiners had expected 30 percent growth in Office 365 commercial revenue, which would have been down from more than 40 percent in revenue growth in the past two years. Microsoft got 10 percent more revenue from Office commercial products and cloud services, which includes Office 365 as well as its more traditional Office software. 
Microsoft ended the quarter with 28 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, up from 27 million from the previous quarter.
Gaming revenue of $1.9 billion was up 1 percent, as Microsoft prepares for the launch of the Xbox One X console on Nov. 7. A decline in gaming hardware revenue was offset by an increase in Xbox software and services revenue, CFO Amy Hood said on the conference call. The KeyBanc analysts had expected $1.64 billion in gaming revenue.
LinkedIn revenue of $1.1 billion for the quarter was flat sequentially.
 As for Windows, revenue from companies putting Pro versions of the operating system on devices was up by 4 percent. The KeyBanc analysts had expected a 1 percent decline.
Microsoft's Surface hardware revenue was up 12 percent for the quarter, following the introduction of the Surface Laptop in June. Search ad revenue was up by 15 percent, as the company saw higher search volume, as well as more revenue per search.
 In terms of guidance, Hood said the company expects to report $27.8-28.6 billion in revenue in its fiscal second quarter, which will end on Dec. 31. Analysts were expecting the company to guide to $28.15 billion in revenue for that quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Office 365 commercial growth will continue to outpace the decline of the transactional Office business, Hood said. 
Microsoft will increase its capital expenditures ""to meet growing demand and capacity needs"" in the fiscal second quarter, Hood said. 
 Microsoft stock is up about 27 percent since the beginning of the year. In its fiscal first quarter the company acquired Cycle Computing, introduced the Azure Container Instances cloud service and said it was working on an artificial intelligence chip for a future version of its HoloLens mixed reality headset.

 Big tech stocks are already having a record day on Wall Street. 
 Amazon, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet all reported Q3 earnings after the bell Thursday, beating Wall Street expectations and sending stocks on the rise after hours and into the start of trading Friday. 
Amazon surged 11 percent, Microsoft spiked 9 percent, and Alphabet rose more than 5 percent.
 All three tech giants hit all-time highs in morning trading. 
Here's a roundup of the tech companies' big beats Thursday.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella
 Technology is the most important industry for stocks today, indicating that blowout earnings from giants such as Microsoft could be good for the market.
 Shares of Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel soared nearly 6 percent or more in Friday trading after reporting solid quarterly earnings that came in well above Wall Street's expectations. The stocks are among the largest in the S&P 500 by market capitalization. In fact, the technology sector overall has the largest weighting in the index at 23.2 percent, according to a Sept. 29 fact sheet.
The high weighting and strong performance heading into earnings season have tied the S&P 500's performance closely to that of technology stocks, especially over the last three months. During that time period, tech had the highest correlation to the S&P at 0.87, according to Kensho, a quantitative analytics tool used by hedge funds.
 The closer a correlation is to 1, the more in sync two parts of the market are. The closer a correlation to zero, the more independent two parts of the market are. Telecommunications had the lowest correlation with the S&P over the last three months at 0.3.
""Frankly, it makes sense the correlation has risen here recently"" between tech stocks and the S&P, said David Lebovitz, vice president and a global market strategist on the JPMorgan Asset Management Global Market Insights Strategy Team. ""What you're seeing here as breadth has narrowed over the last couple of weeks, investors have [bought stocks of companies] growing both revenue and earnings as people get a little skittish.""
The eight-year-old bull market is the second-longest in history, and many investors worry that a sharp drop in stocks is due soon. A bull market is a period without a drop of 20 percent or more in stocks from a recent high. 
Lebovitz also pointed out that in a sluggish growth environment, stocks such as technology tend to perform better. The International Monetary Fund's latest global growth outlook this month forecasts a modest rise of 3.6 percent this year. 
 The relationship between tech stocks and the S&P has not always been this close. Over the last six months, tech has tied with consumer discretionary for the highest correlation with the S&P at 0.82, according to Kensho.
Over the last two years, tech falls to third place behind industrials and consumer discretionary, the analysis showed.
However, consumer discretionary is almost a play on tech as well since e-commerce giant Amazon.com is the largest stock in the sector. Shares of the company leaped 11 percent to all-time highs Friday after reporting a quarterly earnings beat and strong sales growth in its cloud business, Amazon Web Services.
 Big tech earnings aren't over yet. Apple, which has the largest market capitalization in the S&P at $821 billion, is scheduled to report quarterly results on Nov. 2. Facebook, the fourth-largest S&P stock by market capitalization, is set to post results a day before.
Going back further into history, the S&P 500 is almost always up when tech stocks are up.
Since the current bull market began in March 2009, whenever the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) has gained more than 2 percent in a month, the S&P 500 has risen 96 percent of the time with an average return of 3.2 percent, according to Kensho.
On the other hand, the S&P has almost no chance of gains without tech stocks rising. When the tech ETF falls more than 2 percent in a month, the S&P falls 92 percent of the time with an average decline of nearly 3 percent, according to Kensho. The study looked at 37 such instances since the beginning of this bull market going back to 2009. 
The S&P 500 traded Friday nearly half a percent higher within a quarter of a percent of its all-time high. The tech ETF rose more than 2 percent to a record high as technology stocks led S&P gains, while five sectors traded lower.
To be sure, some analysts worry that technology stocks are rising too quickly as investors chase performance. It's not a healthy sign for the market if only technology-related stocks are rising. In 2015, only Amazon and Netflix doubled, while Alphabet and Facebook were up double digits. But the S&P 500 was barely changed on the year.
""As tech becomes a larger and larger component of the S&P 500, its contribution to risk is larger as well,"" Lebovitz said.

 Why Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel are still buys   
 7:17  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  00:57 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer was blown away by the hugely positive earnings reports from the market's top technology companies that tricked in after Thursday's bell.
 ""Who did the best job? Who stole the show? Was it Amazon? Was it Alphabet? Maybe Intel. Could be Microsoft. The answer? All of them, and all for different reasons,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Amazon's third-quarter earnings stole the show with accelerating revenues, a growing customer base, 42 percent sales growth in Amazon Web Services and a busy Prime Day.
 The e-commerce giant's stock soared 13 percent on Friday to a record high of $1,100 per share.
Alphabet's earnings report shined thanks to its 70 percent growth in YouTube, which now delivers 100 million hours of content per day to its users. Shares of the internet colossus climbed over 4 percent on Friday.
""The company has $100 billion in cash, 60 percent of that overseas, which really makes you wish Congress would get its act together on tax reform,"" Cramer noted.
Microsoft blew away Wall Street's earnings estimates by delivering 42 percent growth in subscription revenue from its Office 365 offering and 90 percent revenue growth from Azure, its cloud platform.
As of Friday's closing bell, shares of Microsoft were up more than 6 percent.
Finally, Intel stole the show with its earnings report showing an improving top line, healthy gross margins and signs of recovery in the personal computer segment. On Friday, Intel's stock soared almost 8 percent.
""How is it possible that all of these tech titans are doing so well?"" Cramer said. ""Today's tech strength is all about data. More specifically, the explosion of data via the cloud. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are the big three of web services, the backbone of the cloud. Intel's chips for data center servers are being pulled along for the ride.""
As personal computers — Intel's bread and butter — fall back into relevance as a way to access the web, Cramer said other consumer patterns are also changing around this secular trend.
Now, many consumers' jobs and lives revolve around smartphones, and the data center functions as the ""central nervous system"" of the world's communications, Cramer said.
""These firms are all integral to that setup, which is why they can make a fortune here,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Credit to Amazon for seeing it all coming ahead of everyone else. Credit to the other guys for playing catch-up rather than give-up.""
As the big four's stocks continue their journeys higher, Cramer only had one reservation about analyzing their prospects.
""The people who run them are all such visionaries about where things are going that I just can't keep up,"" he said. ""And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why their stocks are really flying higher, and why they're all-stars at the show. [That's] why their growth seems almost unconstrained. And that's why, even after today's moves, the stocks of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel are still all buys.""

 Tech stocks are on fire, will Apple and Facebook join the party next?   
 6:56  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  04:44 
 Big tech is getting bigger.
 Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, the world's five most valuable public companies, added $181 billion to their combined market value on Friday.
Investors piled into the group a day after Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings.
 For the stock market, it was more of the same. Those five companies have gained almost $900 billion in market capitalization over the past year. They've each outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017, and have been the top contributors to the index's 15 percent gain.
Despite potential political and regulatory pressures on Google, Facebook and Amazon and loud voices of concern about the tech giants hurting competition and controlling too much of our data, the stock moves reflect financial performance. And the performance is staggering.

 People are clicking on more Google ads. Amazon, which picked up $62 billion in stock market value on Friday, is delivering more of everything. Those two companies plus Microsoft are picking up share of the rapidly growing cloud-computing market. 
Even though Facebook and Apple don't report results until next week, investors drove the stocks up on Friday to the tune of a combined $51.4 billion. Facebook is projected to record 40 percent sales growth on Wednesday. The next day, Apple is expected to report growth of more than 8 percent, thanks to sales of 46 million iPhones, according to FactSet. 
The tech leaders pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record closes on Friday. Rallies don't last forever, but investors aren't finding many reasons to bet against tech.

53,2017-10-31,Microsoft's cellular Surface Pro model is launching in December  Microsoft veteran Julie Larson-Green is leaving  ,"Jeniece Pettitt
 Microsoft said Tuesday that the cellular version of its Surface Pro hybrid tablet will be released in December.
 The Surface Pro was announced earlier this year, but without a release date. At the time, the U.S. technology giant said the device would support mobile connectivity.
Now, Microsoft has confirmed that the Surface Pro will come with data connectivity and that it will ship in December. Users can input a Nano SIM or use the in-built eSIM to connect to a carrier.
 ""Half of the global workforce will be mobile by 2020. The office is no longer restricted to a set of buildings — it's at home, in a cafe, a city across the globe, or on a plane,"" Panos Panay, corporate vice president of Microsoft Devices, said in a blog post Tuesday.
""With so many changing locations your device becomes your office and many of our customers tell us that's what their Surface is to them — a mobile office."" 
The Surface Pro is a high-end tablet with keyboard that competes with Apple's iPad Pro. Microsoft pioneered the form factor of these devices when it released the first Surface product in 2012. Now it has different products in the Surface line, including a laptop and desktop device.
Surface has also been a key revenue driver in recent times. In the September quarter, Microsoft said Surface revenues rose 12 percent.

Microsoft executive Julie Larson-Green at a company event in 2008.
 Microsoft on Tuesday confirmed that a longtime executive, Julie Larson-Green, is leaving the company. The news comes a few months after Larson-Green stepped back from her role as chief experience officer for Office productivity as she was recovering from surgery.
 Larson-Green joined Microsoft in 1993, a year after the arrival of the company's current CEO, Satya Nadella. She was once seen as a potential candidate to replace former CEO Steve Ballmer, but Nadella was ultimately chosen for that task.
Larson-Green has held top roles in Microsoft's Windows and hardware groups, but most recently she was focused on Office in the age of the cloud. She was one of Microsoft's most prominent female executives. Tuesday is her last day there.
 ""We thank Julie for the numerous contributions she's made to Microsoft over the last 25 years, and we wish her the very best in her new endeavors,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email.  ZDNet previously reported the news.
Larson-Green's role was leading ""engineering and design of the Office productivity experiences that make it easy for people to access information, connect with others and accomplish tasks across all their devices,"" she wrote on her LinkedIn profile. 
Larson-Green previously worked under another Microsoft veteran, Steven Sinofsky, until Sinofsky left his position as head of Windows in 2012. At that point she took over Windows software and hardware engineering. 
 tweet
 Last year Larson-Green told Business Insider that she was the one who removed the Clippy virtual assistant from Office apps like Microsoft Word in 2007. ""We were just ahead of our time with the technology,"" she said.
In May, The Information said that most of the people who had been reporting to Larson-Green will now report to company veteran Jeff Teper, corporate vice president of Office, OneDrive and SharePoint.

 AI is bring computing to life, Microsoft exec says   
 3:29  AM ET Wed,  1 Nov 2017 |  03:35 
 Microsoft is working on an artificial intelligence (AI) chip for its next generation HoloLens headset.
 And the U.S. technology giant could take it to other products in its hardware range, Panos Panay, corporate vice president of devices at Microsoft, told CNBC on Tuesday.
In July, Microsoft disclosed it was working on a processor for the second generation of HoloLens, a headset that allows users to interact and touch digital images overlaid on the real world. Microsoft calls this ""mixed reality."" The AI chip will allow HoloLens to do things like recognize objects in the line of sight.
 It marks Microsoft's first foray into AI chips, as it looks to take on rivals such as Apple and Google.
The software giant is also looking to expand its offering. When asked by CNBC if Microsoft will introduce AI chips across the device range, Panay said ""yes"".
""We have to continue to find those pieces of silicon, those chipsets that have to be developed to bring sensors to life, to connect people with each other and with their products,"" Panay told CNBC in a TV interview.
Microsoft now has an array of devices. It has expanded its Surface line of tablets, which was launched in 2012, to include a laptop and desktop. It also has the Xbox gaming console and HoloLens headset.
There's an arms race in AI chips at the moment. Huawei introduced its own AI chip called the Kirin 970 that it put in the Mate 10 smartphone released earlier this year. Apple's new iPhones also have the company's own A11 bionic chip inside.

Panos Panay, corporate vice president of device at Microsoft, speaks about the new Surface Laptop during a launch event, May 2, 2017 in New York City.
 Chips within devices allow those gadgets to use ""AI on device."" This means that the devices don't need to communicate with the cloud to do complex AI tasks, making them more efficient.
Panay said it works with partners and carries out in-house development to bring the chips to market. Microsoft also has a number of hardware partners. For example, Huawei and Lenovo both make tablet and keyboard devices that run Windows, the operating system made by Microsoft. Panay said that the company will look to license out its chips to partners.
""I think one of the most important things that we do in Surface and in our chip development is... the opportunity to make sure we get the technology created within Surface and then proliferate it with our partners and give everybody the opportunity to use it,"" Panay told CNBC.
""I mean, this is where we can get technology out to more people.""

 Demand for new Xbox console ‘super high,’ Microsoft exec   
 5:34  AM ET Wed,  1 Nov 2017 |  01:28 
 Demand for Microsoft's Xbox One X console is ""super high"" ahead of its release next week, the company's head of devices told CNBC on Tuesday.
 The One X is the high-end version of Microsoft's Xbox games console with souped-up specs aimed at the next generation of gaming.
Microsoft is releasing the device on November 7 and it appears demand has matched expectation.
 ""I won't talk about the exact numbers but the demand is super high, we are very, very excited about Xbox One X right now,"" Panos Panay, corporate vice president of devices at Microsoft, told CNBC in a TV interview Tuesday.
""I won't compare it to other consoles. What I'll say is the demand for Xbox One X right now is exactly where we anticipated, even more so when you see that excitement for the product... this is something that resonates with gamers.""
But the high demand has also prompted warnings of shortages in some regions. The U.K.'s Xbox head Harvey Eagle said in a recent interview with Gamesindustry.biz that he ""can't guarantee that stock will be available in launch week for people to just walk into a store and pick up.""
One of the major features highlighted when the Xbox One X was announced was its ability to support virtual reality (VR). Sony's PlayStation has a virtual reality offering. So far, however, there has been no VR headset released by Microsoft.

The Microsoft Corp. Xbox One X video game console sits on display during the E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on Tuesday, June 13, 2017.
 Instead, it has been focusing on what it dubs ""mixed reality,"" which merges the real and digital worlds. It has a Windows Mixed Reality platform that allows developers to create apps for several of the headsets that have been made by partners such as Dell and Lenovo.
There are still no mixed reality headsets for the Xbox but Panay said that you may ""start to see that happen.""
""Mixed reality can span in so many different forms, whether it's off the back of the device, whether it's in virtual reality headsets that you have, or its HoloLens, you are starting to see that span through Windows and that platform for Windows does bring it to life,"" Panay told CNBC.

55,2017-11-02,Microsoft inks major wind power deal with Swedish utility firm Vattenfall  ,"Pontus Lundhal | AFP | Getty Images 
 State-owned Swedish energy company Vattenfall has signed a 10-year deal to power Microsoft's international data center operations in the Netherlands using wind power.
 Microsoft will receive all the energy output from a new onshore wind farm to be built approximately 40 kilometers north of Amsterdam, Vattenfall said in an announcement Thursday. The Wieringermeer wind farm will begin producing renewable energy from 2019, it said.
It was recently announced that Vattenfall would invest over 200 million euros ($233.06 million) to ""repower and expand"" the Wieringermeer facility, which will be home to 100 windmills. These will collectively generate around 1.3 billion kilowatt hours of renewable electricity, equivalent to the consumption of roughly 370,000 homes.
 In its own announcement, also released Thursday, Microsoft said that the wind farm would be built and operated by Nuon, part of Vattenfall.
""Investing in local clean energy to power our local data center is a win-win for our business and the Netherlands,"" Brian Janous, Microsoft's general manager of energy, said in a statement. ""Microsoft is committed to bringing new renewable energy sources online to power our data centers.""
Microsoft is one of many tech giants looking to embrace clean energy. In October, Amazon announced that its biggest wind farm to date was operational.
The business said that Amazon Wind Farm Texas, which is located in Scurry County, would add over 1 million megawatt hours of clean energy to the grid annually.

56,2017-11-03,"Facebook, Google, Microsoft, SpaceX to Trump: US will lose $460.3 billion if we end 'dreamer' protection  The simple exercise a psychologist taught Satya Nadella and Microsoft execs that can help you succeed  Big tech dominates, is it warranted?  ","The future of ""Dreamers,"" children who arrived in the United States illegally, is pitting President Donald Trump against big tech.
 And this week, big tech upped its opposition to Trump's effort to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by filing an amicus brief, or a legal statement of support, in California on Wednesday.
The amicus brief breaks down how damaging it would be to U.S. companies, workers and the economy for DACA to be repealed. The lawsuit says if DACA is rescinded, the U.S. economy would lose $460.3 billion over the next ten years. Contributions to Social Security and Medicare would be reduced by $24.6 billion in the same time frame, the lawsuit says.
 In September, Trump decided to rescind DACA, which President Obama had established in 2012. Trump said he would allow the program to expire in March. Trump claimed Obama overreached his legislative authority to set up DACA, but the lawsuit big tech is supporting refutes this claim.
""DACA closely resembles deferred action programs adopted in the past, and complies fully with the applicable statute. The agency's rescission of DACA, predicated entirely on that erroneous legal conclusion, therefore cannot stand,"" the lawsuit says.

 Zuckerberg says it's a 'sad day' as tech execs slam Trump for ending DACA   
 2:38  PM ET Tue,  5 Sept 2017 |  01:03 
 The amicus brief included signatories of 108 tech firms including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Tesla, SpaceX, Uber, Twitter, Verizon, Lyft, eBay, and the list goes on.
 DACA gives ""Dreamers"" the ability to work in the U.S. legally. The $460 billion hit to the U.S. economy if DACA is rescinded is because 700,000 ""dreamers,"" who are currently employed, would lose their jobs in the next two years. That's equivalent to 1,400 dreamers losing their job every day, the lawsuit says.
""Dreamers"" currently work at 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Walmart, Apple, General Motors, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Home Depot and Wells Fargo, the lawsuit says. Replacing those ""Dreamers"" put out of work will cost U.S. companies $6.3 billion.
The lawsuit disputes the claim that ""Dreamers"" are taking jobs that would otherwise go to Americans, instead positing ""Dreamers"" are often taking jobs that companies struggle to fill with qualified workers.
""The jobs being filled by Dreamers post-DACA are largely jobs for which there is a shortage of qualified workers—not the jobs that are or could be filled by U.S.-born workers,"" the lawsuit says. Indeed, since 2012, when Obama established DACA, the unemployment rate has fallen by almost half, the lawsuit says.
In September, when Trump announced his decision to rescind DACA initially, there was an outpouring of support from tech CEOs and leaders.""This is a sad day for our country. The decision to end DACA is not just wrong. It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream, encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government, and then punish them for it,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a public Facebook post.
Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a tweet, ""Dreamers are our neighbors, our friends and our co-workers. This is their home.""

 });Satya Nadella's first job as the third CEO in Microsoft's 40-year history was to get a huge company to unite behind a single goal: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. In his latest book, ""Hit Refresh,"" Nadella says he enlisted psychologist Michael Gervais, who devised a simple exercise:
 Write down your guiding principle in 25 words or less—and read it aloud to your peers.
There were no initial volunteers, Nadella wrote in his book. Dr. Michael Gervais, a high-performance psychologist and co-founder of Compete to Create, a psychology-based mental training consultancy, had discovered something curious about the group at Microsoft.
 The company was stacked with high-performers, but none of them were willing to volunteer for a simple exercise. ""The answers were hard to pull out, even though they were just beneath the surface,"" wrote Nadella. ""Fear: of being ridiculed; of failing; of not looking like the smartest person in the room.""
No executive, each with so much riding on their shoulders, wanted to look foolish in front of their peers, Nadella writes. This revealed Microsoft's huge problem: It wasn't a lack of creativity or ideas. The problem was that people simply didn't want to share them.

 Microsoft HR exec: These are the 3 skills you should have to score a job at Microsoft   
 1:33  PM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  01:21 
 Write your ideas down
 His first step was to have every participant articulate what inspired them—oftentimes an idea so nebulous people have trouble defining it themselves. ""Everybody has a personal philosophy but very few are able to articulate it,"" Gervais tells CNBC Make It.
This philosophy can be anything, from ""to earn the most money in the company"" to ""pay off student loans"" or ""help change and empower the world."" (In fact, Gervais's personal philosophy is ""Every day is an opportunity to create a living masterpiece."") Writing the philosophy down forces people to ""choose what are the guiding principles that help them navigate their choice of thoughts, their choice of words, and their choice of actions.""
Notable figures in history, says Gervais, can be summarized in a few words. For example: Martin Luther King Jr. was a civil rights activist pushing for equality (seven words). But more importantly, that sentence contains something intimate and secret: a personal philosophy.
 Listen, then understand
 Next, Gervais had each participant read their philosophy aloud and have the room listen without judgment. ""Without critique,"" says Gervais. ""Listen and understand what the guiding philosophies."" This lets the room become familiar with their motivation, what drives them and gives them purpose.

 9:04  AM ET Thu,  6 Oct 2016 |  01:01 
 The exercise also makes the speaker vulnerable to his teammates, by sharing something intimate about themselves. ""If we're gonna do things that are challenging and difficult together, this is a way to front-load and understand and better interpret where they're coming from,"" says Gervais. ""If I'm like a very process-oriented person, and I like to develop things, I might need you on the team.""
 Trust
 Sharing that personal philosophy makes you vulnerable, says Gervais, and vulnerability develops trust. ""There's a pretty simple equation for trust,"" says Gervais. ""It's time multiplied by behavior."" The point is to better understand the intent of that person's behavior.
""There are three things as humans we can train,"" says Gervais. ""We can train our craft, our bodies, and our minds."" This was developed from watching top performing figures in sports, says Gervais: ""What we've learned from world-class athletes is that they train all three.""
Microsoft, says Gervais, has deployed this exercise to great effect: Over 30,000 people in Microsoft have gone through the training, articulated their personal philosophies to their peers, and most importantly, learned to trust each other.

57,2017-11-06,Microsoft HR exec says to stop following this popular interview advice if you want to get hired  ,"When it comes to interviews, there's a difference between practicing your responses and rehearsing them. That's according to Chuck Edward, Microsoft's head of global talent acquisition.
 Though conventional wisdom says to practice your interview responses, Edward says ""some people become overly practiced and rote.""
""People become flustered and think it's all about the perfect answer,"" he tells CNBC Make It, ""and it's not.""
 As the head of talent at a major tech company, Edward says all he really wants to see is that ""you're curious, you're read up and you have an affinity for the company.""
""Come in with knowledge about the company,"" the HR exec emphasizes.

 });
 The second issue with rehearsed answers, says Edward, is that they don't engage the interviewer.
A disengaged hiring manager is more likely to forget about you as an applicant, which may affect whether you get the job.
To connect with your potential employer and make your interview memorable, says Edward, rehearse your questions, not your answers.

 ""People should really be prepared with questions that have depth and rigor,"" says the exec. ""Really show that curiosity.""
Asking challenging and thoughtful questions helps you stand out from the pack because they make the interview more fun and engaging. The Microsoft HR exec doesn't deny that interview preparation is key. However, he says there's a balance between under-preparing and over-preparing.
Edward says that he's often ""pleasantly surprised"" with the questions people ask him. Tough questions, he explains, force the interviewer to really think about the company in new ways.
""It becomes a dialogue, and you become challenged, and you can feel it that they're making you better [as an interviewer],"" he says.

Satya Nadella and Jeff Weiner on Microsoft acquiring LinkedIn, June 13, 2016.
 Microsoft is doing more with its big LinkedIn acquisition, and it could help you score your next job. On Wednesday the company is taking the covers off something called a Resume Assistant for its Word program. 
 Drawing on LinkedIn data, the tool shows you how other people have described jobs that are similar to yours if you're working on a resume in Word, and it will highlight skills of people who have the job you want — along with relevant LinkedIn Learning courses through which you can pick up new skills.
Plus, the tool makes the job hunt a little easier, by bringing into Word certain job openings that you might be interested in. ""Along with job openings, you'll see details of what the job requires, allowing you to tailor your resume to a specific role,"" LinkedIn senior product manager Kylan Nieh wrote in a blog post.
 The Resume Assistant also gives you a shortcut to turning on LinkedIn's Open Candidates feature, which tells recruiters that you're interested in learning about new job openings. Open Candidates makes you twice as likely to get contacted by recruiters, Nieh wrote.
It's has been almost a year and a half since Microsoft agreed to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. In April the company introduced an integration between Dynamics 365 for Sales and LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and introduced Dynamics 365 for Talent, which draws on LinkedIn's recruiting tools. More recently, Microsoft said it would start to show LinkedIn contact details in Office 365 apps like Outlook.
In the most recent quarter, LinkedIn contributed $1.1 billion to Microsoft's top line.

A shopper outside a Kroger supermarket in Peoria, Illinois.
 As Kroger moves to cloud computing, the nation's largest grocery store chain is sending millions of dollars to Microsoft and Google.
 But not to Amazon.
""For obvious reasons competitively, it doesn't make sense for us to do a ton to help grow that business for them,"" Chris Hjelm, Kroger's chief information officer, told CNBC in an interview. 
 With Amazon's retail business pushing into more industries and competing more directly with a growing number of companies, Amazon Web Services is starting to experience a backlash. Kroger is joining the likes of Wal-Mart and Target in finding other vendors to handle their massive workloads for their digital and e-commerce offerings. Alphabet said in its latest earnings release that Kohl's has moved to Google's cloud.
In a blog post on Monday, venture capitalist Glenn Solomon from GGV Capital underscored how pervasive this has become. Solomon said several of his firm's portfolio companies that use AWS have been asked by retail clients to ""provide a mirrored service on another cloud because they'd prefer not to have their data stored with Amazon given competitive fears.""
For Kroger, that fear has become more obvious by the day. In August, Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion and instantly cut prices at the upscale grocer. CNBC has also been reporting on Amazon's potential efforts to crack the pharmacy market, another reason for Kroger to be concerned.

 7:11  PM ET Wed, 17 May 2017 |  02:22 
 Kroger gets about 9 percent of sales from its more than 2,200 pharmacies.
Hjelm said the company started investing heavily with Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud late last year. With Azure, the grocer is rolling out digital shelf technology to combine the use of sensors and smartphones to alert customers about relevant deals. For e-commerce, delivery and data-focused initiatives such as smart pricing, Kroger is turning to Google. The company also uses infrastructure technology from Pivotal.
Kroger does have some projects running on AWS for businesses that the company acquired. But for any new initiatives, ""that investment in growth is not going to AWS,"" Hjelm said. Regarding Microsoft and Google, ""we feel like we're not losing anything from a competitive perspective working with those companies,"" he said.
If AWS is worried about Kroger representing an emerging trend, it's not showing up in the unit's financial performance or its market share.
Revenue in third quarter surged 42 percent to $4.58 billion, and AWS produced $1.17 billion in operating income for a company that's used to running with little to no profit. Nordstrom, Under Armour, Lululemon and Nisa Retail in the U.K. are a few of the retailers and consumer brands that count on AWS.

 For cloud infrastructure as a whole, AWS controls 34 percent of the market, followed by Azure at 12 percent, IBM at 8 percent and Google at 5 percent.
According to AWS, retailers will continue to use its infrastructure because they care most about agility, security and performance when deciding where to run their workloads.
""AWS is the clear leader in these areas,"" a company spokesperson said in an e-mail. ""Retailers' end users don't care about any rivalry that may exist with another retailer.""
Like most big established enterprises, Kroger isn't moving everything to the public cloud. The company still has many of its core computing functions and storage in its own data centers. 
But Hjelm said that in the cloud, Kroger has thousands of projects for testing and development running as well as live applications. He wouldn't specify how much the company is spending on the cloud, but he said it's in the millions of dollars and is split roughly equally between Microsoft and Google.
""Over time that balance could shift depending on who creates more value,"" he said. 
Tariq Shaukat, a president in Google's cloud division, said in an interview that even if retailers have been reluctant to give Amazon their money, a lot of them have still historically run on AWS. Google is picking up customers now because its cloud platform finally has the services they need, he said.
""There's an increasing recognition that GCP is a viable option and a leader in areas they care about, like security, data analytics and machine learning,"" he said.

Salesforce chairman and CEO Marc Benioff.
 At Dreamforce two years ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had a prime speaking spot and Salesforce's Marc Benioff touted the blossoming partnership between the two companies.
 Those days are gone. 
On Tuesday, Benioff used part of Salesforce's investor day meeting at Dreamforce to talk up Salesforce's expanded partnership with Google and its growing relationships with Amazon, Cisco, Dell and IBM. 
 But he didn't include Microsoft in that group, even after the companies made a big deal about their work together in 2014 and again in 2015.

 CRM's Benioff: How we're getting around the 'loyalty is dead' problem   
 6:57  PM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  01:16 
 It's a complicated relationship. Microsoft and Salesforce compete in areas like business intelligence and customer relationship management software. Beyond that, Microsoft outbid Salesforce for LinkedIn in 2016, and Microsoft previously tried to buy Salesforce.
This week, Salesforce made some moves of its own onto Microsoft's turf, integrating more deeply with both Google and Facebook.
At the investor meeting, Kirk Materne of Evercore asked Benioff if it would be possible for Microsoft and Salesforce to ""come back together on behalf of customers.""
Here's a transcript of what Benioff said in response:
 No, there's always one person in the room who's using a Surface laptop, so I get that. And it's you. Who else is using a Surface laptop? Raise your hand. OK, we have three people. And how many are using Macs? Raise your hand. How many iPads? OK. How many PCs? And then we've got the three Surface. You know, look. They're 1 percent of the CRM market. You know the numbers. I like having competitors. But what I just get blown away with is how they just can't keep, you know, that management team in place. They just keep leaving Microsoft. You know that. And I think they don't have confidence in that ability to execute in that business. So that has weighed to our favor, and customers feel that. You know because you go to these conferences just like I do. There is no conference like this that they do and that's the — in my opinion, the mark. That is — why is it that they don't have anything like this? That when they put on a conference like something — it's always the resellers who come together, and then -- where are these people? Now, that isn't to say they don't have, like, Build, where they get these really high-end developers using the IDE. You know what I mean? Is that the conference I've been to where I'm like, Oh, yeah, these are all the -- and they're all Windows -- they have a Windows fever. And they have Windows API fever at the conference. But I haven't seen that in any other part of their business, other than the Windows API. Maybe they'll get it in Azure -- I don't know. But I haven't seen that yet. Because the last time that I went to the conference, I didn't see that. I only see that fever around the Windows API. And the Surface laptop. 
Microsoft declined to comment.

 Start-up R3 now has more than 60 companies, including the likes of Microsoft and Intel, actively using its blockchain platform.
 The financial technology (fintech) company said Monday that dozens of firms are engaging with its open source distributed database network Corda.
Blockchain, one of the fastest growing technologies around, is seeing increasing interest from big tech and financial multinationals alike.
 Also known as distributed ledger technology, blockchain allows vast amounts of data to be stored across a network of computers around the world rather than on one local server.
R3 added that, as well as the growth of the number of partners using its Corda platform, more than 100 banks, insurance firms, regulators and trade associations are collaborating with the fintech company as members.

 ""Intense"" research and development has been poured into Corda over the last two years, R3 said.
The Corda platform is used to develop distributed ledger solutions that are interoperable. This means enabling software applications to communicate, exchange data and use that exchanged data.
""We recognized early on the potential for our partners to generate revenue by contributing to a vibrant ecosystem of interoperable distributed ledger applications,"" R3 CEO David E. Rutter said in a statement Monday.
""Our open, collaborative community gives companies complete freedom to develop innovative solutions to their customers' specific challenges. We are delighted with the demand we have seen from companies in different industries and regions to profit while working together with R3 to make Corda the leading peer-to-peer platform for global commerce.""
In October, R3 said it had worked with a number of international banks including Natixis, Barclays, HSBC and Commerzbank on a blockchain-based payments network to speed up cross-border transactions.
The firm raised $107 million from 40 investors earlier this year, including Intel, HSBC and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

 Technology could accentuate the gap between the rich and the poor, says Bill Gates   
 3:56  AM ET Wed, 15 Nov 2017 |  03:29 
 Microsoft founder Bill Gates said on Tuesday that technology could ""accentuate"" the difference between the rich and the poor. 
 Speaking at the Misk Global Forum in Riyadh, he said that the benefits of technological advancements, may not be felt by all if developed in the wrong way.
""If we're not careful, technology will actually accentuate the difference between the well off and the poor because if it's expensive, if you learn about it only in a rich country school, then you'll have the difference between the well off and the poor people even worse,"" Gates said. 
 The billionaire also addressed concerns over artificial intelligence (AI), and said its benefits will outweigh any potential pitfalls.
""We are in a world of shortage, but these advances will help us take on all of the top problems,"" he said at a CNBC-moderated panel in the Saudi Arabian capital.
""We need to solve these infectious diseases ... We need to help health care workers do their job.""

 Gates believes that ultimately AI will alter the labor environment in developed countries but will help society take care of older people or address class sizes in schools.
""As we free labor up from things like manufacturing, we can shift it to some of these very human-centric needs,"" he said. Gates has previously said that robots should face an income tax.

Gate's comments come just days after high-profile physicist Stephen Hawking warned on the emergence of AI, saying it could be the ""worst event in the history of our civilization"" unless society finds a way to control its development.

George Soros speaking at the 2015 CGI Annual Meeting in New York.
 George Soros' investment fund dumped its stock holdings in Apple and Snap in the last quarter while reducing stakes in other major tech giants including Facebook and Twitter, regulatory filings show.
 The billionaire investor's hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, sold 1,700 shares of Apple, and 1.55 million of Snap stock in the September quarter. This wiped out the hedge fund's stake in both companies, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings released Tuesday revealed.
It's important to note that the fund's holdings in Apple were relatively small, worth just $291,278 at Tuesday's market close. 
 However the Snap holding is significant. The 1.55 million shares were worth $19.48 million at Tuesday's close. 
There is a lot of bearishness around Snap, which has continued to miss earnings expectations and failed to grow its user base significantly. Snap shares are down over 48 percent since it went public in March. Wall Street analysts are also not sold on Snap. The stock has 19 ""hold"" ratings, nine ""sell,"" and one ""strong sell,"" according to Reuters data. 
Soros Fund Management also reduced its stake in Twitter by 5,700 shares. It still holds 18,400 shares of the social media site.
Facebook also fell out of favor with Soros. The investor dumped 367,262 shares of the social networking giant in the last quarter. Soros Fund Management still owns 109,451 Facebook shares.
But not all names in the technology sector were sold off. Soros upped his stake in Microsoft by 99,000 shares and Amazon by 2,500 shares.
The SEC filings only show the change in share ownership of Soros' fund, but no commentary as to his fund's thinking behind the trades.
Major technology stocks have been on a tear this year, although some of the newly-listed names such as Snap have struggled. 
Apple, which Soros' hedge fund also sold all its shares in, is up nearly 48 percent year-to-date. Analysts are excited at the potential of the new iPhone X, released earlier this month. Apple shares hit a record high last week.
Soros' position contrasts to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which topped up on Apple shares in the last quarter. Buffett's conglomerate increased its holdings of the iPhone maker's stock by 3.9 million to 134.1 million, a SEC filing released Tuesday showed.

Alan Ruck and Charlie McDermott on ABC's 'The Middle.'
 Microsoft and privately held GitHub on Wednesday are separately unveiling tools that will make it easier for programmers to pair up and get work done together. 
 Pair programming, a concept that goes back decades, is a controversial subject in the world of software development because not all developers are comfortable with having others see them do their work.
But pair programming can help organizations keep projects ticking along if one person leaves the company or takes breaks, since the other person on the team will be familiar with the current state of the project. Pairs may also find mistakes more efficiently by switching between coding and checking their partner's work. Other benefits include on-the-job training (by pairing experienced programmers with newbies), team-building and brainstorming.
 The new technologies from Microsoft and GitHub call to mind the real-time collaboration features of Microsoft's Office 365 and Google's G Suite — but here Microsoft and GitHub are making sure developers will be able to use the new tools in the coding environments they're used to rather than forcing them to use unfamiliar applications.
With Microsoft's Visual Studio Live Share tool, developers will be able to use their own text editors or integrated development environments while collaborating. Developers will be able to install GitHub's new Teletype package for use with the start-up's open-source Atom text editor, but GitHub is also releasing software libraries that will let people build systems to enable collaboration in other programs. 
Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise group, is demonstrating Visual Studio Live Share on Wednesday at the company's online Connect conference. ""When we show it, it's going to set the developer world on fire with excitement,"" Guthrie said in a media briefing earlier this month. 
The introductions come about a year and a half after public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services acquired Cloud9, a start-up with a cloud-based development environment where people can collaborate. And earlier this year, Red Hat acquired start-up Codenvy, whose tool can be run as a cloud service or in companies' on-premises data centers.
Nathan Sobo teamed up with other developers in person every day during his time at Pivotal Labs — one of a few companies known to use pair programming — before joining GitHub, where he works on Atom.  
""I just absorbed so much knowledge and got so much out of those few years that I worked in that style, that synchronous collaboration, working together at same time with someone, where you're actually discussing what you should name that method, rather than getting feedback ... three days later,"" he said. 
Sobo said that even he has his moments when he doesn't want a very social coding experience — but he said he contributed to the Teletype feature with an eye toward making something he would want to use on a daily basis.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to have the biggest technological impact on the oil and gas industry over the coming years, according to Microsoft's oil and gas director for the Middle East and Africa.
 Speaking at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition Conference (ADIPEC) on Wednesday, Omar Saleh said technology disruptions over the past three years had been a ""wake-up call"" for all oil and gas firms.
He said AI would be of ""massive importance"" over the next to five to 10 years, before adding that of any technology, AI would also have the most impact on the oil and gas sector overall.
 The U.S. shale revolution paved the way for a three-year oil price downturn that sent crude spiraling from more than $100 a barrel in 2014 to about $60 today. That has piled pressure on the oil-dependent economies of OPEC nations and forced a round of production cuts this year.
On Tuesday, Baker Hughes GE CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said ""continuous disruption"" in the oil and gas industry should be viewed positively.
Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Omar Saleh believes AI will have the greatest technological impact on the oil and gas industry over the coming years.

 With companies like Microsoft, Facebook, IBM and Amazon receiving thousands of applications a year, your hiring chances may appear slim. That's why high level recruiters and HR execs at these four tech giants have openly discussed what it takes to snag a job at their respective companies.
 Microsoft

 The company's head of global talent acquisition Chuck Edward tells CNBC Make It that candidates should do three things to stand out from the competition: Show that you have a career mindset, demonstrate a customer obsession and prove that you're a learner.
Edward adds that your resume should also describe your past leadership experience and how you have ""achieved results, progressed and learned."" Why? Because Microsoft favors applicants who ""embrace the future,"" says the HR exec.

 As the social media giant continues to grow so have the number of applicants. One former employee says he went through 17 rounds of interviews before finally snagging a role at the company.
In an interview with job site  Glassdoor, Facebook's vice president of people Lori Goler says applicants should do three things to secure a coveted position: Research the company culture, be knowledgeable about projects Facebook is working on and show that you're both a builder and a learner.

 She also recommends taking the time to thoroughly read call transcripts and earnings articles for current insight on what's most important to the company. That way, you can speak eloquently about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision for the company during job interviews.
But most importantly, says Goler, show how you can contribute to the organization's growth.
""We're always looking at something and thinking, 'That works pretty well, but it can be even better,"" she tells Glassdoor. ""What that means is that we are never done,""
 IBM
 IBM takes a unique approach to hiring, vice president of talent Joanna Daly tells CNBC Make It. As the tech industry deals with the ongoing shortage of workers, IBM is now focusing on skill-based hiring rather than education level and four-year degrees.
IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty refers to these types of employees as ""new collar"" hires. One of those new collar hires is Sean Davis, a security engineer for IBM's cybersecurity business.
He tells CNBC Make It that his number one advice for other non-traditional candidates looking to edge their way into the company is to obtain ample hands-on experience.
""Always stay current on the industry and on new technology,"" says Davis. ""Always hone your craft.""
 Amazon
 The retail giant has held massive career fairs to fill open roles across its facilities. But even with this hiring frenzy, scoring a position at the company is no easy feat. In fact, the company continously ranks as one of the most sought-after employers.
If you want to score a position at the retailer, says Amazon's director of university recruiting Miriam Park, you should be focused on the customer and ""relentlessly curious.""

 });Today, many recognize businesswoman and philanthropist Melinda Gates for her tireless efforts to make positive change in the world. When she started working at Microsoft in 1987, a year after the company  went public, Gates was brought on as a product manager.
 Though she would find much success at Microsoft in years following, the flop of a major project in 1995 — considered one of the  world's worst inventions by Time Magazine — taught her a lesson she says she will never forget: Failure provides the opportunity to stop what you're doing, rethink and revitalize.
""Anytime that you're dreaming big, you're also going to have spectacular failures,"" Gates said at this year's Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.

 In the time that Gates eventually worked her way up to general manager of information products at Microsoft, she led a team on a project called Microsoft Bob, as she recalled in a  recent LinkedIn article.

 According to Gates, only about a third of households had personal computers in the mid-1990s and people were still getting accustomed to them.
 ""Anytime that you're dreaming big, you're also going to have spectacular failures.""
-Melinda Gates, Co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
 ""You know all those things that are instinctual to us today — like looking for a menu of options at the top of the screen? Most people didn't have those instincts yet,"" Gates said.
To make using the computer easier, Gates and her team built Microsoft Bob, a software program that turned your desktop into a virtual home. For example, to write, you clicked on a pen and paper and to check the date, you clicked the calendar on the wall, she explained.
Unfortunately, Microsoft Bob wasn't the hit Gates anticipated it would be.
""The program needed a more powerful computer than most people had back then and a lot of critics found the visuals too cute,"" Gates said.
Still, Gates needed to get on stage and present the software demo, noting that ""flops like this were part of the process.""
 ""The chance to take big risks is exactly what I love about tech.""
-Melinda Gates, Co-founder of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
 ""Walking into that public demo was the hardest thing I have ever done,"" Gates said.
But more importantly, she added, it was a reminder that she chose to put herself in that position.
""The chance to take big risks is exactly what I love about tech,"" she said.
Until that point Gates said she had made most of her mistakes on expense reports, but as the face of the project, ""failing so hard—and so publicly—was a new experience entirely.""
When Gates finished her demo, she said she finally understood ""why the old joke about failures leading to promotions existed in the first place.""
Failures provide ""a chance to pause, learn something and choose a new and better direction,"" she said.
Although Gates  left Microsoft to focus on her philanthropic work and family a year later, her former boss at Microsoft and former CEO of the Gates Foundation Patty Stonesifer told Fortune Magazine in 2008 that, ""No question, if she had stayed, she would have been on the executive team at Microsoft.""
As for Microsoft Bob, the project was discontinued the following year. Part of its ""cute"" visuals, however, still exists as the notable font  Comic Sans.

Reid Hoffman, founder and Chairman, Linkedin, at 2015 WEF in Davos, Switzerland.
 Microsoft has elected four new members to its board of directors, bringing the total to 14.
 Nine of those 14 have been appointed since Satya Nadella became the company's third CEO in February 2014. Nadella has already made a significant mark on the company, emphasizing its cloud products over its highly profitable but declining Windows franchise, and getting Microsoft out of the smartphone business, among other  moves. The company's shares are up more than 70 percent since Nadella took over. 
The new members had all been previously announced, but were officially elected by shareholders in the company's annual meeting on Wednesday. The new members are:
 Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, which Microsoft acquired in June 2016 Hugh Johnston, CFO of Pepsico Penny Pritzker, a former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and founder-chairman of private investment firm PSP Capital Arne Sorenson, the CEO of Marriott International 
Mason Morfitt of hedge fund ValueAct has stepped down from the board as well, as expected. Morfitt was invited to join in 2014 after his firm acquired a 0.8% stake in the company in 2013. ValueAct reportedly pressured the company to replace then-CEO Steve Ballmer, and its CEO wanted Microsoft to release Office for Apple's iPad – a move that Ballmer resisted, and one of the first things Nadella did when he took over.
With the new appointments, only three of Microsoft's independent board members predate Nadella's tenure: Chairman John Thompson, who joined in 2012; former Bank of America Vice Chair Charles Noski, who joined in 2003; and former BMW Chairman Helmut Panke, who also joined in 2003. 
Nadella and founder Bill Gates are also on the board. The full list is here.

Microsoft's Surface Precision Mouse.
 It's taken three and a half decades, but Microsoft has finally made the ultimate mouse.
 The Bluetooth-enabled Surface Precision Mouse, which Microsoft revealed in October alongside the second generation of its high-end Surface Book convertible laptop, is very comfortable while still looking elegant. It's got six customizable buttons, a rechargeable battery, a thumb rest, and a scroll wheel that can be switched from smooth and fast vertical scrolling to granular line-by-line scrolling. And you can use it with up to three PCs at the same time.
In other words, it's just right -- even if it does run on the expensive side at $100. Mice from Logitech and Razer have boasted some of its features, but none has felt this natural.
 While Amazon, Apple and Google are busy refining smart speakers that house their respective virtual assistants, Microsoft in recent years has focused on getting more traditional hardware right. The Surface Studio all-in-one desktop PC is an engineering marvel. The Surface tablet has spawned countless imitations. And the latest Xbox is the world's most powerful console. Office and Windows certainly bring Microsoft more revenue than Surface and Xbox products, but at the same time, the company has visibly raised its hardware standards under the leadership of Satya Nadella.
In years past, certain Microsoft mice have had shortcomings. The Intellimouse, which debuted in 1996, was corded or required an unwieldy wireless receiver for the better part of a decade. The Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 6000, which arrived in 2006, was said to have strangely placed buttons. The Explorer Mini Mouse, which showed up in 2008, had no off switch. The Arc Touch Mouse, which debuted in 2010, could lie flat but was an ergonomic mess.
The Surface Precision Mouse has none of these drawbacks.

 What it does have is a sliver of a button tucked behind the scroll wheel that makes a pleasant clunking sound when pushed. It immediately becomes obvious what role this button serves when you glide your finger on the scroll wheel. With the push of the little button, you can switch between very speedy scrolling or something a lot more precise, which can come in handy when exploring long files and websites. Scrolling in fast mode is strangely satisfying. It's like gliding your finger along a stack of fresh printer paper.
If you have a Mac, you won't be able to customize the buttons, but if you're running Windows -- with the exception of the new Windows 10 S -- you'll be able to tweak their functions with the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center software. The battery inside the mouse can't be removed, but Microsoft says a single charge will last for up to three months, and you can recharge the battery with an included micro-USB cable. Unlike Apple's Magic Mouse, the port is at the front end of the mouse, so you'll still be able to use it while it's charging.
Do you need a mouse like this if you have one that works perfectly well? Of course not. But this is a mouse I love to use. And if you sit in front of the computer every day like me, then you might just come to love it, too.

Microsoft EVP Terry Myerson (left) and Asus CEO Jerry Shen (right) with the Asus NovaGo “Always Connected” PC.
 Microsoft has long been known as an Intel and AMD shop. 
 But on Tuesday, the company is taking the rare step of unveiling a laptop that's powered by another chip giant: Qualcomm.
By selling Windows 10 PCs with Qualcomm processors, which dominate the smartphone market, Microsoft is aiming to reach a mobile audience that's been much more inclined to buy Apple and Android devices.
 At an event in Hawaii, Microsoft showed new laptops from Asus and HP with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chips that use ARM's architecture. The PCs have a modem for LTE connectivity, so they don't have to exclusively rely on WiFi networks. 
Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and devices group, told CNBC that he uses his Asus NovaGo ""always connected"" convertible laptop for a week at a time on a single charge. That's very unusual at a time when most laptop and tablet batteries won't last longer than a day.
""In my day at the office, I walk around with one of these PCs and a phone,"" Myerson said, adding that he doesn't bring the laptop's charging cable along with him. He said that it's similar to his Fitbit wearable device, which he charges every four or five days.
While it's an experimental endeavor for Microsoft, over time this class of devices could present a challenge to AMD and Intel, whose processors have historically been the standard for Windows PCs. More than half of Intel's revenue comes from its client computing group, which includes PC and tablet chips.
For Qualcomm, teaming up with Microsoft represents another potential revenue opportunity, one that takes advantage of the research and development it's done for mobile devices, Cristiano Amon, an executive vice president, told CNBC.
 'Office experience'
 ARM-based chips have already made their way into the laptop market. Google has been trying to improve the performance of Chromebooks that use ARM chips and there have been reports that Apple has interest in releasing Mac computers that rely on ARM silicon.
The area of real uncertainty is how well many kinds of applications work on an ARM-based Windows 10 system. Myerson said iTunes and Spotify and many games ""run great"" on his Asus NovaGo. Microsoft developed a version of Office for these ""always connected"" PCs.
""We looked at it and said we want it to be a native Office experience,"" Myerson said. That involved compiling the ""portions of the Office apps that are most used,"" he said.
This isn't Microsoft's first time trying to build ARM-based PCs. In 2012, when Microsoft introduced the first generation of its Surface tablet, one variation packed an ARM chip and ran a new operating system called Windows RT. But a year later the company announced a $900 million write-down largely because of unsold inventory of these tablets.
Microsoft first announced plans to bring Windows 10 to PCs running ARM chips a year ago, and in May it named the first six manufacturers: Asus, HP, Huawei, Lenovo, Vaio, and Xiaomi.

 New Windows 10 PCs will run on Qualcomm chips, but Intel investors shouldn't worry just yet   
 2:34  PM ET Wed, 31 May 2017 |  00:51 
 In June, Intel warned that it may bring an intellectual property case relating to Windows 10 on Qualcomm chips, depending on how it's implemented.
""We do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel's intellectual property rights,"" two Intel executives wrote in a blog post.
Microsoft said in a statement that it's still working closely with Intel. ""We're excited to offer customers a broad range of great PCs and look forward to innovating with Intel in the future,"" the company said.
Asus initially has two options for always-connected PCs: a $599 model with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage, and a $799 version with 8 gitabytes of RAM and 256 gigabytes of storage. They deliver 22 hours of battery life and 30 days of standby time.
Asus CEO Jerry Shen underscored the importance of having fast connectivity.
""If you have the gigabit LTE, your speed is faster than the WiFi,"" Shen told CNBC. Asus intends to release more ARM-based Windows 10 PCs in the next two years, Shen said.
As for Microsoft, the company announced a Surface Pro device that comes with LTE connectivity in October, though it uses Intel silicon. Myerson wouldn't comment on whether Microsoft had future plans for a Surface using a Qualcomm chip.

Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene.
 Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood was complimentary of Google's cloud computing unit on Tuesday, and had particularly flattering words for CEO Diane Greene.
 Speaking at the 2017 Wells Fargo Tech Summit in Utah, Hood said that Microsoft has been seeing Google's rival cloud more frequently in a competitive setting.
Microsoft's Azure cloud service and Office 365 cloud-based productivity apps are in a high-stakes battle with the Google Cloud Platform and G Suite. In the public cloud business, both Microsoft and Google trail market leader Amazon Web Services.
 In her Tuesday remarks -- which came after Wells Fargo analyst Philip Winslow specifically asked about Google -- Hood also praised Greene, the head of Google's cloud efforts for the past two years. Greene, who was formerly CEO of VMware, announced last week that she hired Diane Bryant from Intel to be operating chief of Google's cloud.
""We've seen more of them in the past few quarters than we've seen before,"" Hood said. ""I think they're making a good effort. I think Diane Greene is an excellent leader and an established enterprise CEO.""
Hood went on to say that Greene has ""always been a winner.""

 Hood's amicable tone represented quite the contrast to the war of words of late between AWS and Oracle when it comes to the cloud. Oracle CEO Mark Hurd went after Amazon in October, claiming a workload on AWS could be six times more expensive than on Oracle's cloud. AWS CEO Andy Jassy responded last week saying, ""I think they're a long way away in the cloud.""
In the third quarter, Amazon had 31.8 percent share of the cloud infrastructure services market, Microsoft had 13.9 percent and Google had 6 percent, according to Canalys.
Hood talked more broadly about cloud competition in certain parts of the world and she acknowledged the growth of the Alibaba public cloud. Alibaba isn't among the leaders in the U.S., but elsewhere in the world, particularly in Asia and Africa, it's a different story.
The company is ""well-funded, well capitalized, certainly aggressive."" Hood said.

 A digital currency has added more than $12 billion to its market value after the firm behind it said it was teaming up with a number of big tech firms, including Microsoft and Samsung on a ""data marketplace.""
 Called IOTA, the cryptocurrency saw a spike on Wednesday, rallying more than 90 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data from industry website Coinmarketcap. Its price soared to an all-time high of $5.55 at 8:27 a.m. London time, almost doubling Tuesday's price of $2.78. It is now the fourth-largest digital asset by market capitalization, dethroning Ripple's XRP.
The rally followed an announcement by the IOTA Foundation, a German non-profit firm that oversees the virtual currency, last Tuesday, that it had partnered with the likes of Microsoft, Samsung and Fujitsu on a blockchain-based marketplace that lets them sell data.
 David Sonstebo, IOTA's co-founder and CEO, said data is ""the new oil,"" and that the marketplace project is letting firms sell data to incentivize them to share this data that would otherwise be wasted.
""At present, up to 99 percent of this precious data gathered is lost to the void,"" he told CNBC in an email. ""IOTA incentivize sharing of data through its zero fee transactions and by ensuring data integrity for free on the decentralized distributed ledger.""
He added that the marketplace is currently a pilot project, and that examples of data being shared included weather and air quality data.
 IOTA 'a sleeping giant'
 Sonstebo said that the cryptocurrency's surge in price was due to its approach to blockchain technology and partnerships with established firms.
""IOTA's seemingly 'out of nowhere' explosive growth can be traced back to the fact that it has been somewhat of a sleeping giant,"" Sonstebo said.

Sonstebo added that the cryptocurrency's growth was also owed to its increased publicity.
""Unlike the overwhelming majority of projects in this space, IOTA has not done any paid promo, so now that there's a steady stream of these large news stories the major technological advantages become known to the wider audience,"" he said.
""I believe this is the reason for the rally, as well as the fact that IOTA just entered China and Korea, which are naturally huge markets, meaning a lot of new people buying.""
 'Blockless' blockchain
 A blockchain is a massive, decentralized database that records cryptocurrency transactions. Its original use-case was as the ledger for all bitcoin transactions.
But IOTA's open-source blockchain platform differs to mainstream blockchain networks which use encrypted ""blocks"" to record those transactions.

 This analyst explains how Microsoft can hit a $1 trillion market cap   
 12:19  PM ET Mon, 11 Dec 2017 |  03:50 
 Microsoft could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2020 or sooner, analysts from Evercore ISI said in a Thursday note. The company's current market cap is around $650 billion.
 In coming up with their calculations, the analysts — who also raised their target price from $93 to $106 — pointed to the growth of Microsoft's Office business, partly thanks to pushes into the world of front-line workers and the education market.
The analysts also cited the new Microsoft 365 offering, which bundles several services along with Office 365 applications, as a key growth driver, as it could convince businesses to subscribe to services they normally would skip.
 The analysts expect Microsoft's Office 365 commercial business to generate $26.86 billion in revenue in the company's 2021 fiscal year, which will go through the second half of 2020 and continue through the middle of 2021.
""While we believe best in breed offerings such as Okta for IAM, Tableau/Qlik for BI/Analytics, Box/Dropbox for collaboration, or VMware AirWatch for EMM will maintain their respective leadership positions, on the margin, we expect Microsoft 365 to win incremental share over time due to its ease of integration with the broader Office productivity platform and enterprise customers' proclivity to buy a 'suite' of products vs. best of breed solutions, especially in the SMB market where IT resources are scarce,"" Evercore analysts Kirk Materne, Fenn Hoffman,  Tom Mao and Daniel Greenfield wrote.
The analysts predicted that the Office 365 consumer business will produce $5.18 billion in revenue.
At the same time, Microsoft's Azure public cloud business — which is second only to Amazon Web Services — continues to grow, and the Evercore analysts said that in the company's 2021 fiscal year it could register $22.19 billion in revenue. The analysts pointed to the Azure Stack private cloud software, which is meant to mirror what's available on the Azure cloud, as a point of differentiation. 
""As Azure's revenue scales across a more fixed base of infrastructure investments, we believe Azure has the potential to drive meaningful operating leverage and FCF over the next 4 years and should ultimately reach 30%+ op. margins (vs. AWS at 25% today), to become one of Microsoft's core earnings and FCF drivers over the next decade,"" the analysts wrote.
They noted that declines in devices and on-premises versions of the Dynamics and Office software should be partly offset by growth from LinkedIn and gaming.

 Microsoft, Google concerned about Broadcom/Qualcomm deal   
 7:46  PM ET Fri,  8 Dec 2017 |  01:48 
 Microsoft and Google are among companies that have expressed private concerns to Qualcomm about a Broadcom takeover, according to people familiar with the matter.
 The companies are wary of Apple's potential influence over a deal, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. They're also worried about Broadcom's reputation of cutting costs rather than investing in new technology, the people said.
Qualcomm rejected a hostile $105 billion bid last month, leading to Broadcom nominating a new slate of board directors for the San Diego-based company earlier this week. Regulators frequently ask for industry input when making a judgment on whether or not to approve a deal. Qualcomm has said it has antitrust concerns about a potential Broadcom takeover.
 Qualcomm has told Microsoft, Google and other companies not to make any public statements  opposing a deal, said the sources. Qualcomm wants to find out if Broadcom will significantly increase its $70-per-share offer before taking a firmer stance against a possible deal, said the people. 
A Broadcom transaction for Qualcomm may improve Apple's relationship with the chipmaker, which currently provides chips used in the iPhone and iPad.  Qualcomm is suing Apple for patent infringement after Apple in January sued Qualcomm for roughly $1 billion, claiming Qualcomm charged royalties improperly. Qualcomm has issued and applied more than 130,000 patents covering, among other things, smartphone technology.
The litigation could result in Apple abandoning Qualcomm for future products. 
But Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan has privately expressed optimism about settling an ongoing litigation with Apple if Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm, according to a person familiar with the matter.
 Why Microsoft and Google would object
 Apple's gain could be its competition's loss. 
In Google's case, many of the phone and tablet makers who build phones on its market-leading Android operating system use Qualcomm processors. Android and its derivatives make up 85 percent of the smartphone market, according to IDC.
Microsoft just announced the first Windows 10 PCs using Qualcomm chips, and it may continue to push these types of tablet and hybrid PCs, which use less power than traditional Intel-based PCs, as it seeks to compete with Apple's iPad. 
While Microsoft and Google are two of the largest companies in the world, neither rival Apple or Samsung in terms of sales volume from either Qualcomm or Broadcom. Still, both Microsoft and Google perceive an independent Qualcomm as being more closely aligned with their interests than a Broadcom-owned Qualcomm that is tighter with Apple.
The companies have also privately expressed concerns with Tan's reputation of cutting costs at the expense of increasing spending on innovation, two of the people said.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a company conference in London in November 2014.
 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Wednesday said he wished that the company had gotten into the public cloud business earlier.
 Nadella, who ran Microsoft's cloud and enterprise business before becoming its CEO in 2014, made the admission to Marty Chavez, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, during a conversation streamed live from the bank's Facebook page.
Microsoft launched its first Azure service in 2008, two years after Amazon introduced its core cloud computing and storage resources. Today, Amazon Web Services holds nearly 32 percent of the public cloud infrastructure services market, while Microsoft has about 14 percent, according to Canalys.
 Over the years, Microsoft had built up a major server software business — which it stored on companies' premises, Nadella said. Then came AWS — which forced Microsoft to rethink its whole business model.
""We knew by looking at what Amazon was doing that we needed to reinvent ourselves, and by the way, the margins were going to be very, very different -- tough challenge,"" Nadella said, in response to a question from Chavez about disruption and internal innovation.
Nadella said Microsoft cofounder and former CEO Bill Gates had even encouraged him to rethink the server business.
It's important for a business to be able to recognize and move in response to the emergence of a new business model, Nadella said.
""In our case, we did,"" he said. ""I mean, I wish we had started even earlier ... like always. ... Even if you don't disrupt yourself, you've got to be great at responding to these shifts in business models.""
Also in the interview, Chavez asked Nadella who he most looks up to in the technology industry, other than Gates and Nadella's direct predecessor, Steve Ballmer. Again, Nadella referred to Amazon.
""I would say clearly what Jeff Bezos has done at Amazon ... is probably one of the amazing stories of the recent past,"" Nadella said. ""But I'm a great admirer of anyone who creates new categories but are not overnight successes -- but who have gone through this period of 10, 15 years where people are saying, 'What is this business all about?' but have been able to turn and sort of say, 'Well, this is something that is an enduring hit.'""

 Branson wants to go to space and send hyperloop pods shooting through underground tunnels at the speed of airplanes. Gates wants to rid the world of Polio and Alzheimer's disease, as well as implement the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's extensive list of other moonshots. Both the Microsoft founder and Virgin Group founder backed a start-up that grows meat in a lab and hopes to reduce the environmental impact of raising livestock. 
And while some challenges seem insurmountable — even for a pair of the world's most powerful people — Branson and Gates agree it's crucial to chase big ideas, even if success isn't immediate.
 ""Bill and I spoke about the importance backing long-shot projects,"" Branson writes on his blog about a meeting the billionaires had Tuesday. The two  met in Paris for a summit focused on one such challenge, climate change.

 ""Not all ideas will work,"" Branson writes. ""But if we back enough of them, then the more likely it is that there will be a handful that can have a huge impact.""
Gates' willingness to act on his dreams to improve the world is an inspiration for Branson.
""I've learned so much from Bill. He built a formidable company and decided to put his vast wealth into solving the problems of the world,"" Branson writes.
For Branson himself, dreaming big has also been key to his success.
""Dreaming champions aspiration, spurs innovation, leads to change, and propels the world forward. Dream big and you will be rewarded… trust me,"" he writes in an earlier post.
But he says it can't be done alone: ""I believe that we can truly achieve great things when we all come together.""

Microsoft executive vice president Harry Shum at a company event in San Francisco in December 2017.
 Microsoft is in a race with the tech giants to make its software smarter.
 At a briefing with reporters on Wednesday, the company showed some of its new intelligent features that are being embedded in its productivity apps, virtual assistant and search engine.
Artificial intelligence is becoming a regular theme for Microsoft when it comes to product enhancements, as it is for Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. AI was clearly on display at Microsoft's Build developer conference in May and has even been added to the company's strategic vision.
 Here are some of the new things Microsoft announced on Wednesday:
Outlook: The email app will soon start underlining action items that are mentioned in the body of emails. You can then click on one of those items and respond with a prewritten message. Gmail, Facebook Messenger and LinkedIn are also using smart reply messages.
Word: In Word Online, while you're viewing a document, the app will be able to spell out acronyms that appear.  
Excel: Following the launch of a similar feature in Google Sheets, Microsoft will soon allow Excel to automatically generate charts based on data in your spreadsheet.
 Bing: Microsoft announced a partnership with Reddit that will add some parts of the social discussion board's content to the Bing search engine. Content from Reddit can provide answers to certain queries at the top of search results, and Bing will also flag upcoming ask-me-anything sessions, when relevant. After you type certain shorter queries into Bing, it will ask a question that you can answer to refine your search.
 Cortana: Microsoft will bring the Cortana virtual assistant to its Android launcher app and to Cheetah Mobile's Android launcher. Cortana — which competes with the Google Assistant, Amazon's Alexa, and Apple's Siri — is also integrating with Gmail. Additionally, Microsoft is enhancing Cortana so that it can handle multiple types of tasks in a single interaction.
Accessibility tools: Microsoft is bringing more features to its Seeing AI app for explaining what's in front of a smartphone's camera. The app, a helpful tool for people with impaired vision, can now recognize lights, colors and currencies.

75,2017-12-19,"Microsoft Moves to End Secrecy in Sexual Harassment Claims  Facebook and Microsoft independently stopped North Korean cyber attacks last week, a US official says  ","Satish Bate | Hindustan Times | Getty Images
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers his keynotes at the company’s flagship technology and business conference -- Future Decoded 2017 in Mumbai, India.
 The wave of sexual harassment claims has toppled powerful men in entertainment, media and politics. Now, it is also creating permanent changes in workplace policy at one giant technology company.
Microsoft, one of the world’s biggest software makers, said on Tuesday that it had eliminated forced arbitration agreements with employees who make sexual harassment claims and was also supporting a proposed federal law that would widely ban such agreements.
The moves make Microsoft an early company — and certainly the most prominent — to take such steps to end legal agreements that have been criticized for helping to perpetuate sexual abuse in the workplace. Forced arbitration lets companies keep harassment and discrimination claims out of court, effectively cloaking them from public view and, in some cases, allowing serial harassers to continue their conduct for years.
 “The silencing of people’s voices has clearly had an impact in perpetuating sexual harassment,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, said in a phone interview.
Microsoft’s action shows how the flood of harassment accusations has gone beyond individual cases to an examination of policy changes for ending the misconduct. That includes greater scrutiny of legal settlements that have silenced victims of abuse.
In one prominent case, an arbitration clause nearly prevented Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News anchor, from bringing her lawsuit over sexual harassment against Roger Ailes, the former chairman and chief executive of Fox News. Ms. Carlson found a legal maneuver allowing her into court, but many employees are not as lucky.
In an op-ed article in The New York Times in October, Ms. Carlson wrote that “reforming arbitration laws is key to stopping sexual harassment.” According to the Economic Policy Institute, more than half of American workers are bound by arbitration clauses.
Since then, lawmakers have taken up the issue. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of senators, including Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, proposed legislation that would make forced arbitration in harassment cases unenforceable under federal law.
Mr. Smith of Microsoft said he first became aware of the Senate bill after meeting with Mr. Graham in Washington to discuss cybersecurity and immigration. Mr. Graham urged Microsoft to support the bill, Mr. Smith said.
“What this legislation does is ensure that peoples’ voices can always be heard by going to court, if that’s what it takes for those voices to be heard,” Mr. Smith said. “It’s the kind of step that can make a difference.”
He said eliminating the arbitration requirement for harassment claims by its own employees represented an immediate step the company could take while the Senate bill was being considered. The move is largely symbolic because only a minority of Microsoft workers — numbering in the hundreds in its senior ranks, according to Mr. Smith — have been subject to the requirement. Microsoft will still require those employees to take claims unrelated to harassment and gender discrimination to arbitration. In total, Microsoft has about 125,000 employees around the world.
Like other technology companies, Microsoft has faced accusations that it has tolerated harassment and discrimination against female employees. Last week, Bloomberg reported that documents unsealed in a gender bias case showed that an unnamed former intern for Microsoft accused another intern of sexually assaulting her outside of work, and that Microsoft required the two of them to continue working together while it investigated the claims.
In a statement, Microsoft said it did not tolerate sexual harassment or assault. “We work hard to create a safe work environment for every employee,” the company said, adding that it encouraged the former intern to take her complaint to law enforcement.
Ms. Gillibrand said that getting rid of the arbitration agreements would benefit employers in the long run. “Without the secrecy of mandatory arbitration agreements, serial predators will be less likely to continue climbing the corporate ladder and employees won’t be forced to stay quiet about the harassment they have faced at work, which is good for employees and good for business,” she said in a statement.
By using the arbitration clauses to bar people from joining together as a group, employers — both large and small — have effectively taken away one of the few tools that workers have to fight harassment or discrimination.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has found that forced arbitration “can prevent employees from learning about similar concerns shared by others in their workplace.” Given the proliferation of the clauses, some regulators and civil rights experts also worry that arbitration clauses can obscure patterns of wrongdoing.
Strict confidentiality can turn up in a variety of contexts, from payday-lending outfits, which sometimes rely on them to conceal the true identity of lenders that operate through shell companies, to personal relationships. Employment contracts are among the most problematic, lawyers said.
In arbitration, the rules tilt heavily in favor of businesses, employment experts said. Part of the problem is that instead of judges, cases are decided by arbitrators who sometimes consider the companies that routinely bring them business their clients, according to interviews with arbitrators.
The more often companies head to arbitration, the better their chances of winning the case, according to the conclusion of a 2011 analysis by Alexander J. S. Colvin, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations.
Of 3,945 employment cases decided by arbitrators from one of the nation’s biggest arbitration firms, plaintiffs prevailed in about 31 percent of them when employers had only one case before the arbitrator, according to Mr. Colvin’s study. The rate of victory plummeted by more than half when companies had multiple cases before the same arbitrator.

76,2017-12-21,"Here’s the first big purchase Bill Gates made when Microsoft started taking off  Three Dow stocks, including Microsoft, are poised for a major breakout  ","With a net worth topping $91 billion, Bill Gates can afford pretty much anything he wants.
 After taking his first  leave of absence from Harvard (he would later drop out altogether), Gates moved to Albuquerque, N.M., with partner Paul Allen in 1975, where the pair began working on their fledgling company, Microsoft, full time. Just three years later, the company's year-end sales climbed over $1 million.
By 1987, a 31-year-old Gates became the youngest billionaire ever, and his fortune only continued to balloon, eventually earning him the title of richest man in the world for decades on end.
 Back in 1979, when Gates first started making big money off Microsoft, he decided to splurge on a luxury car: A Porsche 911 supercar, to be exact,  as Business Insider pointed out.

""Sometimes when I would want to think at night, I would just go out and drive around at high speed,"" Gates told Rubenstein. ""Fortunately, I didn't kill myself doing that.""

 Here are 3 Dow stocks to buy at record highs   
 2:09  PM ET Thu, 21 Dec 2017 |  01:55 
 It's been a record-breaking year for the markets as the major indexes track for their best annual performances since 2013.
 With the Dow sitting just a hair below yet another major milestone — 25,000 — Rich Ross of Evercore ISI says there are three names that could propel the index to new heights.
 Oldies but goodies
 First, Ross pointed to a '90s tech darling: Microsoft.
 ""It really doesn't get any better than this,"" he said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""
According to the technician, the stock has just broken out of a 17-year base, which he says is a rare occurrence. But on top of that breakout, Microsoft has just recently become an outperformer relative to the market as a whole.
 Another old-school tech play in the Dow that Ross believes is worth buying is chip stock Intel. ""We're looking at another multiyear base breakout here, an impulsive move coming out of the pattern [and into] a textbook bullish flag continuation pattern,"" he said. ""We bought the dip, now we're going to buy the rip in Intel.""
 Feeling re-energized
 Lastly, Ross looked at Chevron as the best play for investors looking to get into the energy space. The big oil name is only up about 6 percent year to date and Ross believes it is set for a rally going into 2018.
""You can see this big base that's formed over the last year, kind of your classic cup and handle,"" he said. ""And once again, [you have a] textbook flag here.""
This, along with oil inching back toward $60 and possible rising inflation expectations in the air, leads Ross to see Chevron as a strong energy buy.
 Chevron was up more than 3 percent Thursday.

77,2017-12-26,"Since breaking its Microsoft habit, Hortonworks has rewarded investors  ","David A. Grogan | CNBC 
Satya Nadella speaking at the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 In late 2014, when software developer Hortonworks was getting ready to go public, the company was not in the healthiest position. Almost one-quarter of its revenue came from a single company: Microsoft.
 While that was an improvement from the prior year, when a staggering 55 percent of sales came from Microsoft, it was still a bright red flag for investors, who were concerned about whether Hortonworks was diversified enough to flourish as an independent company.
From its $16 IPO price in December 2014, the stock lost more than half its value over the next 22 months to a low of $6.42 in October 2016.
 Hortonworks had a good reason for its Microsoft collaboration, which started in 2011, the same year the fledgling company spun out of Yahoo. As a start-up with a package of open source software for running big data projects, Hortonworks' early integrations with Microsoft's Windows Server operating system and Azure public cloud allowed the company to pick up new business that it couldn't have attracted on its own.
""It put us on the map,"" said Mike Volpi, a Hortonworks board member and a partner at Index Ventures, which backed Hortonworks in 2011. ""It gave us access to a lot of important customers. It was definitely material.""
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who was involved in the Hortonworks deal when he was running the cloud division, said at an event in July that ""Microsoft has always been a partner-led company.""
Today, five companies derive at least 10 percent of their revenue from Microsoft, according to FactSet, but Hortonworks isn't one of them. As of 2016, its reliance on Microsoft was down to 6 percent. Hortonworks now has more than 1,000 customers with active support subscriptions, up from 332 at the end of 2014.

 Investors who stuck around have been rewarded. The stock has more than tripled from its low point and was trading at $20.54 as of midday Tuesday.
Diversifying beyond Microsoft has only been a part of the turnaround. Volpi said that Wall Street, which had been critical of high sales and marketing costs at Hortonworks, has now seen that spending pay off in terms of continued growth. In the latest quarter, Hortonworks generated 45 percent revenue growth from a year earlier, while its operating expenses fell slightly. 
The Hortonworks story resonates across technology and beyond. The five most valuable companies in the world are all U.S. tech companies, and an increasing number of businesses are reliant on those platforms for distribution and revenue.
It's a double-edged sword. As quickly and efficiently as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook can help smaller players get traction, they can just as readily take it away by launching a competitive product, changing pricing or altering their strategy. 
 'It was concerning'
 Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho who has followed Hortonworks for years, said the issue of Microsoft concentration was a real one in the company's early days.  
""It was concerning because at that time you're reliant on Microsoft quite deeply,"" said Lamba, who now has a hold rating on Hortonworks.
Accounting standards require that public companies in the U.S. disclose any customer that accounts for 10 percent or more of revenue. Two companies that currently count Microsoft as a 10 percent customer -- Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive Software -- make games for Microsoft's Xbox game console. For them, Microsoft is both a distributor and a competitor, because the software giant acquired the developer behind ""Minecraft"" and makes its own games like ""Forza Motorsport 6"" and ""Halo 5: Guardians.""
Gaming revenue, which includes console and subscription sales, came out to less than 8 percent of Microsoft's total revenue for the quarter that ended in September.

 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella could have worked at Amazon   
 4:08  PM ET Mon, 18 Sept 2017 |  01:02 
 Two hardware makers have an outsized dependence on Microsoft.
Chipmaker AMD received more than 10 percent of its revenue from Microsoft in 2016 by selling processors embedded in Xbox consoles and Azure servers. 
And then there's Applied Optoelectronics, an obscure Texas company specializing in fiber-optic networking equipment for cable TV and data centers.
Applied has seen its Microsoft business swell from 3.6 percent in 2014 to 12 percent in 2015 and 18 percent in 2016. Its technology is used to ensure that data can move quickly around data centers, which explains why Microsoft and Amazon together accounted for 73 percent of Applied's revenue last year. 
Amazon, through its cloud-computing division, and Microsoft are the two top cloud infrastructure providers, and both are investing heavily in equipment to handle the surge of data moving to the public cloud. Microsoft's capital expenses topped $10 billion in the latest fiscal year.
Applied is picking up substantial business as a low-cost player in a market that includes the likes of Finisar, Lumentum and Oclaro. The stock has surged 65 percent this year.
But things got rocky in October. The company issued a statement with preliminary results for the third quarter and investors hit the exits, sending the shares down 12 percent. The stock is more than 50 percent off its high from August.
 On the earnings call, the company said there had been a ""slowdown in demand from a large customer."" Analysts assumed it was a reference to Amazon.
""We are disappointed with our third quarter performance,"" CFO Stefan Murry said. ""Revenue from this customer in the quarter was approximately 10 percent of total revenue compared with 47 percent last quarter.""
After the report, analysts at D.A. Davidson cited Applied's customer base as a potential risk to the company.
""Applied Optoelectronics depends on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenues,"" wrote the analysts, who nevertheless kept their buy rating on the stock. ""The loss of a major customer could have a materially adverse effect on its financial performance and condition."" 
Applied did not respond to requests for comment. But Murry did emphasize during the earnings call that the company has made progress in diversification.
""We're no longer as tied to a particular customer in terms of living and dying by that visibility,"" he said.

 Workers proficient in those subjects will be ""the agents of change for all institutions,"" Gates told LinkedIn Executive Editor Daniel Roth in a 2016 interview.  
""I do think of basic knowledge of the sciences, math skills, economics — a lot of careers in the future will be very demanding on those things,"" Gates says.

 You don't have to be an expert in coding or the periodic table, but having the ability to think the way these experts do will help you tremendously.
""[It's] not necessarily that you'll be writing code, but you need to understand what can engineers do and what can they not do,"" the Microsoft co-founder says.
They'll likely be revolutionizing your industry, he says.

Safra Catz, chief executive officer of Oracle, arrives at Trump Tower in New York, on Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2016.
 There may be a buying opportunity in Oracle shares if earnings rise, Morgan Stanley said Wednesday. 
 Oracle shares jumped 2.7 percent Wednesday, hovering near $48 a share, down from September's 52-week high of $53.14 per share. Morgan Stanley raised its price target to $57 a share.
Oracle has gone through a necessary reset toward more achievable cloud growth expectations, after ""over-exuberance"" from executives Larry Ellison, Safra Catz and Mark Hurd, analyst Keith Weiss wrote in a research note. 
 Shares fell hard over the past few quarters after investors let go of the idea that Oracle's cloud will become the ""next Microsoft.""
But Weiss said those investors may have been ignoring some potential upside. 
Some of Oracle's businesses are still strong, like databases, licensing and on-premise data storage, Weiss wrote. Plus, Oracle's earnings could benefit from the tax overhaul. In addition to lower tax rates, Oracle could bring back cash from overseas and put it toward stock buybacks, dividends or acquisitions, according to Weiss.
""We see the combination of continued stable fundamental performance, a lower tax rate and an increasing volume of share repurchases pushing to total return for ORCL into the low-teens over the next two years,"" Weiss wrote.
The bullish note comes a day after a report from  The Information said that big cloud software companies like Amazon and Salesforce were looking at alternatives to some of Oracle's database technologies.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a company event in New York in May 2017.
 Microsoft on Wednesday announced that it has acquired Avere Systems, a start-up specializing in data storage. The technology could ultimately help Microsoft pick up more Azure revenue by serving customers who want to use cloud computing while still keeping data in their own facilities. 
 Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
Avere offers hardware for storing data in data centers, but the acquisition seems more about strengthening and increasing the use of Microsoft's Azure public cloud. The technology lets companies use remote computing resources while keeping their data in place, and it can ease the migration of data to public clouds as well.
 Avere offers tools for working with Microsoft's top two cloud competitors, Amazon Web Services and the Google Cloud Platform. Avere said it would bring its tools to Azure in 2015, but today the company's website primarily advertises its integrations with the Amazon and Google clouds.
""We are excited to welcome Avere to Microsoft, and look forward to the impact their technology and the team will have on Azure and the customer experience,"" Jason Zander, corporate vice president of Azure at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post. 
Overall, Microsoft has taken more of a hybrid approach than Amazon or Google in the cloud business. It offers the Azure Stack private cloud software that mirrors what's available from the Azure public cloud. And Microsoft continues to sell server and database software for corporate data centers.
""Over the years, Microsoft has made significant investments to provide its customers with the most flexible, secure and scalable storage solutions in the marketplace and has made Azure the natural home for enterprise applications. This shared focus on large enterprise applications makes Microsoft a great fit for Avere,"" Avere CEO Ron Bianchini, a former vice president of storage hardware company NetApp, wrote in a blog post.
Google, the main business unit of Alphabet, made a rare direct investment in Avere last year. (Most Alphabet investments come through its venture arms.) Other investors include Western Digital Capital, Menlo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Tenaya Capital. In total Avere raised $97 million.
Avere was founded in 2008 and is based in Pittsburgh. Its customers include Johns Hopkins University, Sony Pictures' Imageworks and the Library of Congress.

Satya Nadella speaking at the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 Microsoft, Amazon, and Google said they are working on updates to cloud services and other products to prevent exploitation of chip-level security vulnerabilities.
 The vulnerabilities, which were publicly disclosed by the Register on Tuesday, could allow a hacker to steal information stored in the memory of a wide range of computer chips running on personal devices, like computers, as well as servers in data centers, including those used to run cloud computing services. It could allow a hacker to steal information stored in the memory of the chip itself, including things such as passwords and cached files. It could also pave the way for attackers to weaken other security features.
One of the vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown, is known to affect Intel chips. Another, Spectre, could affect chips from many vendors. Indeed, Arm said that some processors based on its technology are affected.
 ""We're aware of this industry-wide issue and have been working closely with chip manufacturers to develop and test mitigations to protect our customers,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. ""We are in the process of deploying mitigations to cloud services and have also released security updates to protect Windows customers against vulnerabilities affecting supported hardware chips from Intel, Arm, and AMD.""
In addition to patching its cloud services and current and older versions of Windows for servers and desktops, Microsoft has updated its Edge and Internet Explorer browsers. Updates for Microsoft Surface devices are coming as well.
Google was the company to first alert Intel to the vulnerability, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on CNBC earlier on Wednesday.
Subsequently Google released some details about the issues but said a full report is still to come. A new site discussing the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities credits Google's Jann Horn and third-party researchers with discovering them.
Google said it has updated its public cloud service to prevent attacks related to Meltdown and Spectre. ""We used our VM Live Migration technology to perform the updates with no user impact, no forced maintenance windows and no required restarts,"" Google engineering vice president Ben Treynor Sloss wrote in a blog post. But customers will still need to update the operating systems they use on the Google cloud.
Google has also been busy checking on consumer services. Exploitation is ""difficult and limited"" for most Android devices, and the latest version of Chrome OS is patched, Google said.
Amazon told customers of its Amazon Web Services cloud service that the vulnerability ""has existed for more than 20 years in modern processor architectures like Intel, AMD, and ARM across servers, desktops, and mobile devices."" It said that it's already protected nearly all AWS instances, although customers will still have to patch the operating systems they use. 
In the CNBC interview Krzanich said he was not aware of exploits of the issue, and Microsoft has not gotten any indication that the vulnerabilities ""had been used to attack our customers,"" the spokesperson said.
Aside from security concerns, the Register and some individuals suggested that patches to operating systems could result in performance slowdowns. But in a statement on Wednesday, Intel said that ""any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.""
Microsoft told customers of its Azure public cloud in a blog post that they ""should not see a noticeable performance impact.""
VMware has come out with patches for its desktop and server virtualization software.
Linux distribution vendor Red Hat is working on making product updates available to customers. ""Red Hat is taking a proactive position that favors security over performance, while allowing users the flexibility to assess their own environment and make appropriate tradeoffs through selectively enabling and disabling the various mitigations,"" the company said on a website devoted to the vulnerabilities.
Some Red Hat patches are live, and more will be coming in the next few days, a spokesperson told CNBC in an email.

81,2018-01-05,"Here's how billionaire Bill Gates likes to relax—and why you should try his methods, too  ","While Bill Gates is no longer at the helm of Microsoft, the entrepreneur turned billionaire philanthropist still has a few things on his to-do list: eradicating polio, researching treatments for Alzheimer's and improving public education systems. 
 Although tackling the world's most complex problems must seem overwhelming, Gates writes in an article for Time that he's recently begun to take more time for himself.
""When I was in my 20s and early 30s, my whole life was focused on work,"" he writes. ""These days, I'm better at balancing the work that I love to do with my foundation and taking time off to spend with family and friends.""
 Here are his top ways to unwind.
 1. Playing games
 Gates plays the card game Bridge and the board game Settlers of Catan.

 });
 ""My parents first taught me bridge, but I really started to enjoy it after playing with Warren Buffett,"" Gates writes in Time of his billionaire bestie. ""It takes a mix of strategy and teamwork to do well. We always find time to play a few games when we're together.""
Buffett himself spends eight hours per week playing bridge, and tells the Washington Post, ""It's the best exercise there is for the brain."" Buffett even sees lessons in business mirrored in bridge, telling CBS News, ""You have to look at all the facts. You have to draw inferences from what you've seen, what you've heard. You have to discard improper theories about what the hand had as more evidence comes in sometimes.""
 As for Settlers of Catan, ""This civilization-building board game is a favorite in my family,"" Gates writes. ""Melinda, our kids, and I have spent many hours sitting around the table trading resources, building roads, and strategizing to be the first to reach 10 victory points.""
Gates and Buffett may be on to something: 2014 research by the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that embracing cognitive activities like playing card games is beneficial to brain health, according to The New York Times.
 2. Exercising 
 A trip to the tennis court is a way Gates relaxes. ""I have played tennis my whole life,"" he writes.
Fellow billionaire Richard Branson is also a tennis fanatic, and says lessons he's learned on the court also translate to success in business. 
""One key lesson I've learned, which applies far beyond the court, is to treat each point separately,"" Branson writes in a post on LinkedIn. ""Forget the last mistake and move onto the next challenge. Tennis, like business, moves so quickly that if you dwell on the past for even a few minutes, an opportunity will have passed and the moment will be lost.""
Gates and Branson are in good company: other business leaders like Mark Zuckerberg, Oprah Winfrey and Mark Cuban prioritize staying active.  
""Staying in shape is very important,"" Zuckerberg says in a Q&A on Facebook. ""Doing anything well requires energy, and you just have a lot more energy when you're fit.""
 3. Reading books
 Gates is well known to be a voracious reader. 
""On average, I try to read a book a week, and I always bring a whole tote bag of them on vacation,"" Gates writes for Time. 
While Gates may find it relaxing, he's also enjoying the science backed benefits of reading. For example, research published by Stanford found that close reading of a novel increased blood flow to underused areas of the brain. 
Dedicating time to reading can also be critical for success in your career, according to Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban.  While ""most people won't put in the time to get a knowledge advantage,"" Cuban writes on his blog, he tries to spend three hours a day reading to stay sharp. 
For Buffett, that means spending ""five or six hours a day reading,"" he says in HBO's documentary, ""Becoming Warren Buffett.""
 4. Exploring the globe
 Lastly, Gates makes time to travel. One trip in particular had a life changing impact, he tells Time.
""In 1993, Melinda and I visited Tanzania, Kenya, and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo),"" he writes. ""That trip changed our lives and inspired us to start our foundation and get involved in philanthropy sooner than we planned.""

82,2018-01-08,Microsoft 'can't win for losing'  ,"Satish Bate | Hindustan Times | Getty Images
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers his keynotes at the company’s flagship technology and business conference -- Future Decoded 2017 in Mumbai, India.
 This post originally appeared on Hal Berenson's blog on Jan. 6 and is republished here with permission.
 When it comes to the consumer, Microsoft's history can best be described as, ""I got it. I got it. I got it. <THUMP> I ain't got it."" Jan. 6 was the fourth anniversary of my Xbox: Fail blog post, and last week Microsoft put the  final nail in the coffin of Kinect. So it really is an appropriate point to talk about Microsoft and the consumer. Microsoft is not a consumer-focused company, and never will be despite many attempts over the decades. Recognition of this reality, and an end to tilting at windmills, is one of the things that Satya Nadella seems to have brought to the table.
First let's get something out of the way, we need to refine what we mean by the label ""consumer."" It isn't simply the opposite of business or organizational users. Microsoft has always done just fine in providing individuals with personal productivity and content creation tools. The Windows-based PC remains at the center of any complex activity. Sure I book some flights on my iPhone or iPad. But when I start putting together a complex multi-leg trip the PC becomes my main tool. Office has done well with consumers, and continues to do so in spite of popular free tools from Google. And over the last few years Microsoft has gained traction with the artistic design crowd that had always gravitated towards the Mac. So when we talk about the consumer we really are talking experiences that are left of center on the content consumption to content creation spectrum. Microsoft will always be a strong player on the right of center content creation scale, be it for individuals, families or organizations. But other than console gaming, they aren't going to be a significant player on the left of center experiences. And Microsoft fans are going to go crazy over that.
 The end of life for Kinect is the perfect illustration of Microsoft's inability to be a consumer player. The Xbox One with (then mandatory) Kinect was introduced a year before the Amazon Fire TV and a year and half before the Amazon Echo. It was originally tasked with becoming the center of home entertainment and offered a voice interface. Go read my Xbox: Fail piece for how it wasn't ready to live up to that design center. It's pretty typical Microsoft V1 stuff. Unfortunately the Xbox One was also V1 from a console gaming perspective, so Microsoft focused on making it more competitive in that niche and abandoned pushing forward on the home entertainment side. Imagine that: Microsoft had a beachhead of tens of millions of voice-enabled devices in place before Amazon even hinted at the Echo, and failed to capitalize on it. You can repeat that story many times over the last 25 years.
It isn't that Xbox One was the perfect device for the coming voice assistant, or streaming TV, revolutions. The need to be a great gaming console gave it much too high a price point for non-gamers. But Microsoft could have continued to evolve both the experience and produced lower priced, non-gaming focused hardware. Contrast what Microsoft did with what Amazon did around the Echo. When the Echo was introduced it was considered a curiosity, a niche voice-operated speaker for playing music. When Amazon started to gain traction with the Echo and Alexa, they went all in, and as a result have a strong lead in today's hottest segment of the consumer technology space. It reminded me a lot of Microsoft's pivot to the Internet back in 1995. But in the Xbox One case, Microsoft had the vision (at least in general direction), but failed to capitalize on it. Failed to even make a serious attempt. Now, at best, it could fight it out for a distant fourth or fifth place in voice assistants and home entertainment. This consumer stuff just isn't in Microsoft's DNA.
The death of the Groove Music Service is another example, and maybe more telling on why Microsoft hasn't been able to crack the code on the consumer. Groove is just the latest name for Zune's music service. When MP3 players became popular Microsoft jumped on the bandwagon based on its DNA, it relied on third parties that it supplied with technology (e.g., DRM). When that didn't even turn out to be a speed bump on the iPod's adoption, it finally introduced the Zune as a first party device. To have as good an experience as an iPod, the Zune needed an iTunes equivalent and what we now know as the Groove Music Service was born. Despite the jokes that failure often leads to, the Zune was a quite nice device. But since it couldn't play the music you'd acquired with iTunes there really was no iPod to Zune migration path. By the time Zune came on the market the game was already over. As Zune died other consumer-focused device efforts came to the fore (Kin, Windows Phone 7, Xbox One) and the music service lived on. But since the devices never gained traction neither did the music service. And for Microsoft the music service was never a player on its own, it was just a necessary evil to support its consumer device experience. And with that mindset, the failure to gain traction with consumer devices meant Groove was superfluous. Sure Groove could have owned the segments that Spotify and Pandora now dominate, but that was never what Microsoft was going for. And now, it is too late.
Being a content creator or distributor is not in Microsoft's DNA. It has an immune system that rejects it time and time again. Microsoft made a big play on consumer titles in the early to mid '90s, remember Microsoft Dogs and Encarta? Offerings like these are very manpower intensive because they need a lot of content production, editing, frequent updating, sell for very little, are expensive to localize, and often don't even make sense globally. So Microsoft concluded they didn't fit well with its business model and backed away from all but a few major titles such as Encarta. While Encarta was great for its time, the Internet left it competing with Wikipedia. That destroyed what little economic value Encarta had. Other content-oriented efforts, such as Slate, were disposed of to save costs when the Internet Bubble burst. The MSNBC joint venture was allowed to dissolve when its contract came up for renewal. And so on.
I could even say that great end user experiences are not in Microsoft's DNA, though that one is more debatable. Usually it is thought of as being consistently second to Apple. So rather than saying they aren't in Microsoft's DNA, I'd say that Microsoft user experiences are almost always compromised by more dominant aspects of its DNA. And that keeps it from being a great consumer experience company.
What is Microsoft good at? Creating platforms that others build on. Doing work that is technically hard, and takes a lot of engineering effort, that it can sell over and over again. High fixed cost, very low variable cost, very high volume, globally scalable has been its business model all along. Consumer businesses usually have moderate to high variable costs, so there is problem number one. Only the top two players in a segment usually can achieve very high volume, so unless Microsoft achieves leadership early in a segment it never can get high enough volume to have a successful business model. A head-on charge against the established leaders rarely works, and when it does it is a financial bloodbath. So you may not need to be the first in market, but you need to be in early enough for the main land grab —  or wait for the next paradigm shift to try again. And global scaling of consumer offerings is way more difficult than for platforms or business-focused offerings.
Microsoft seems to have resolved to focus on its DNA. It will be supportive, even encouraging, of third parties who want to use its platforms to offer consumer services but avoid going after the consumer directly. So you get a Cortana-enabled smart speaker from Harmon-Kardon, a high-end Cortana-enabled thermostat from Johnson Controls, a set of smart fixtures from Kohler that use Amazon's Alexa for voice control but Microsoft Azure for the rest of their back-end, and an agreement with Amazon for Cortana-Alexa integration.
Will Microsoft introduce consumer devices or services in the future? Possibly, but they will suffer the same fate as its earlier attempts. And I'm not throwing good money after bad (and I did throw a lot at every consumer thing Microsoft ever did). I recognize that these attempts are at best trial balloons, and at worst ill-advised ventures by those intoxicated at the potential size of market. Microsoft is an arms supplier. It should supply arms to companies going after the consumer, but avoid future attempts to fight consumer product wars itself.

 Microsoft's security patches are causing 'blue screen errors'   
 10:52  AM ET Tue,  9 Jan 2018 |  00:54 
 Microsoft on Tuesday provided new details on the performance impact of updates to protect against recently disclosed security vulnerabilities. In certain cases, performance on Windows will be significantly slowed by patches for the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.
 Some people have found that their servers and PCs are performing differently after installing updates, so the news shouldn't come as a big surprise. Still, the new information doesn't line up perfectly well with what Intel said last week when the vulnerabilities were first officially announced. ""Any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant,"" the chipmaker said.
Microsoft expects most people using Windows 7 and Windows 8 on chips that are from 2015 or older will notice performance degradations, Terry Myerson, executive vice president for Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, wrote in a blog post. The company did not publish specific performance benchmarks to back up the claims.
 Some people using Windows 10 with Intel Haswell chips or anything older will notice performance impacts, Myerson wrote. But those people running Windows 10 on Skylake, Kaby Lake or newer Intel chips probably won't notice performance issues, although internally run benchmarks show single-digit slowdowns, Myerson wrote.
The case is different for Windows Server, Microsoft's operating system for servers. Should customers choose to install updates to protect against issues stemming from untrusted code running on those machines, there will be a more significant performance impact, Myerson wrote. ""This is why you want to be careful to evaluate the risk of untrusted code for each Windows Server instance, and balance the security versus performance tradeoff for your environment,"" he wrote.
At this point, Microsoft has provided Meltdown and Spectre patches for 41 of the 45 versions of Windows through Windows Update, Myerson wrote.
Intel stock went down after Microsoft released the news. It traded as low as $43.75, about 2 percent lower than opening price, falling from about $44.34 per share immediately after the announcement. Microsoft stock initially faltered but then reversed its decline.
Later on Tuesday Intel offered new details on PC performance impacts because of security updates.
""Based on our most recent PC benchmarking, we continue to expect that the performance impact should not be significant for average computer users. This means the typical home and business PC user should not see significant slowdowns in common tasks such as reading email, writing a document or accessing digital photos,"" Intel said in a statement. The testing on PCs with the latest Intel silicon found an impact of 6 percent or less, the company said.
Intel said it's still trying to get a sense of performance changes for chips used in data centers.

84,2018-01-10,The simple reason why Bill Gates is no longer the richest person in the world  ,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is now worth $105.1 billion, making him the richest person in recent history. Bezos' wealth surpassed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' previous record from 1999.
 Bezos first overtook Gates as the richest man the world in October, when his net worth reached $93.8 million.
A 31-year-old Gates became the youngest billionaire in the world in 1987, shortly after Microsoft went public. In 1995, at age 39, he was the richest man in the world with a fortune of $12.9 billion,  NPR reports, and held the title on and off for decades.
 But there's a simple reason Gates is no longer the richest person alive, and it's not because of Amazon's tremendous growth. Gates made the choice to give much of his money away.

 In 2000, the same year he stepped down as CEO of Microsoft, Gates co-founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation alongside his wife with the mission of improving the quality of life of people around the world. The couple pivoted to focus on philanthropy full time and have since donated $2.9 billion in cash and 700 million Microsoft shares to charitable causes,  Bloomberg reports.

 The pair plan give away the majority of their wealth throughout their lifetimes and are doing so by thoughtfully tackling major issues around the world.
Gates isn't just giving away his own fortune, either; he's inspiring others to do the same. In 2010, the Gateses teamed up with billionaire friend Warren Buffett to start The Giving Pledge, a movement for ultra-rich individuals to commit to donating at least half of their wealth to charitable causes during their lifetime.
More than 150 millionaires and billionaires have signed the pledge, including titans like Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Branson and Elon Musk.

 ""We have committed the vast majority of our assets to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to help stop preventable deaths such as these, and to tear down other barriers to health and education that prevent people from making the very most of their lives,"" Gates wrote in his Giving Pledge letter. ""Our animating principle is that all lives have equal value.""
The Foundation has already taken on a wide range of issues and projects, starting in 2000 with a $1 billion effort to send more than 20,000 kids to college. More recently, Bill and Melinda have committed millions to fighting Alzheimer's,  providing resources to women in developing countries and promoting global health initiatives around the world, in addition to a variety of other causes.
One of the Foundation'sproudest accomplishments is the work it has done to eradicate polio. It has contributed nearly $3 billion to help eliminate the disease by 2020 and Gates believes the last outbreak could be on the horizon.

 ""Progress in fighting polio might be one of the world's best-kept secrets in global health,"" he acknowledged in the foundation's 2017 annual letter. But soon, he hopes, it will be a secret no more. ""If things stay stable enough in the conflicted areas, humanity could see its last case of polio this year.""
Since 2007, the Gates Foundation has contributed technical and financial resources to accelerate vaccination campaigns, provide routine immunization and polio surveillance partnerships as well as to help fund more effective vaccines.
And the numbers  show that its efforts have made a difference. In 1998, the polio virus was present in over 125 countries and paralyzed 350,000 people every year, mostly children. Since then, polio cases have been reduced by 99 percent, saving 13 million young children from paralysis. Today, there are only twelve known cases of the wild polio virus, according to Jay Wenger, who leads the Gates Foundation polio eradication efforts.

 Had Gates held onto the assets he's given to the foundation, he'd be worth an estimated $150 billion today, according to Bloomberg, which would give him the record.
He'd rather put that money to good use.
""We have been blessed with good fortune beyond our wildest expectations, and we are profoundly grateful,"" Bill and Melinda wrote in their Giving Pledge letter. ""But just as these gifts are great, so we feel a great responsibility to use them well.""
Bezos hasn't yet made a ""a major philanthropic mark,"" as Bloomberg puts it, but some predict that's in the cards for the billionaire. In June, Bezos put out a request for ideas on Twitter, where he said he was ""thinking about a philanthropy strategy."" He followed up to say there's more to come, but he hasn't revealed what that will be.
Although Bezos hasn't taken a deep dive into charitable giving just yet, he and his wife MacKenzie have made several sizable donations. He's partnered with Mary's Place, a local organization in Seattle to provide shelter for the homeless and gave $1 million of his personal funds.

85,2018-01-12,Amazon lost cloud market share to Microsoft in the fourth quarter: KeyBanc  ,"David A. Grogan | CNBC 
Satya Nadella speaking at the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 Amazon lost share in the public cloud business in the fourth quarter, while Microsoft continued to gain momentum, according to research from KeyBanc analysts.
 Amazon Web Services had 62 percent market share in the quarter, down from 68 percent a year earlier, KeyBanc's Brent Bracelin and other analysts wrote in a note on Thursday. Microsoft Azure jumped from 16 percent to 20 percent, and Google's share increased from 10 percent to 12 percent, they said.
According to KeyBanc, Azure likely contributed $3.7 billion to Microsoft's fiscal 2017 revenue, which totaled an estimated $96.6 billion. That suggests Azure almost doubled, which is consistent with Microsoft's disclosures about Azure's revenue growth in recent quarters. 
 Amazon, meanwhile, said that AWS grew 42 percent in the third quarter. 
The analysts expect Azure's revenue growth to slow in fiscal year 2018 to 88 percent.
The KeyBanc report compared the big three cloud providers' artificial intelligence tools and found that Microsoft ""has more pre-built models than other public cloud vendors"" and makes them available from more data centers around the world.
Citing Azure growth as well as Microsoft's opportunities in AI, the analysts raised Microsoft's 12-month price target from $94 to $106. The stock closed at $89.60 on Friday.
""After our conversations with leaders at Microsoft, we came away believing the majority of revenue will come from the surrounding infrastructure costs, rather than the monetization of specific AI services, due to the required intensive model training and ongoing inference,"" Bracelin and the other analysts wrote.

86,2018-01-17,Steve Ballmer deserves his due as a great CEO  ,"Anjali Sundaram | CNBC
Steve Ballmer
 Microsoft shares just broke the $90 barrier for the first time. The company now has a market capitalization around $700 billion.
 Investors and the press have been quick to praise CEO Satya Nadella. And he deserves it. Nadella has abandoned Microsoft's ill-timed smartphone foray, stepped on the gas in cloud, and helped refresh the company culture.
On the day he was appointed CEO on February 4, 2014, the Microsoft stock price was around $36. It's almost tripled since.
 I'm not surprised Nadella has done well.  I predicted in August 2013, right after Steve Ballmer announced his plans to step down, that the Microsoft board would pick him as the next CEO because of the solid job he'd done leading the company's cloud and server businesses. He deserves enormous credit for his strong leadership in the past 4 years.
But Steve Ballmer deserves to remembered as a great Microsoft CEO who laid many of the seeds which have allowed the company's stock to explode since he left.
Ballmer is remembered as a big sweaty clownish figure because of videos like this. He's remembered as a buffoon for laughing at the iPhone in 2007. He's remembered for overpaying for acquisitions like aQuantive for $6 billion and trying to buy Yahoo for $44 billion (which, it turns out, would have netted some pretty attractive investment stakes).
Perhaps what irked investors the most about Ballmer is that the stock hardly moved under his watch. A week before he was named Bill Gates' successor in January 2000, Microsoft's stock hit an all-time high of $58 in the midst of the dot com craze. A year later, the stock was $21. When Ballmer agreed to step down as CEO in August 2013 at the urging of activist investor ValueAct and the rest of the Microsoft board, it was $32.
Therefore, over his 13-year tenure, the stock dropped, was flat, or slightly up -- depending on where you measure from. Investors complained Microsoft didn't keep up with the gains of its peers.
The day Ballmer said he'd leave Microsoft in 2013, the company's market cap was $245 billion. It's now $700 billion. That doesn't happen simply because a new CEO is more charismatic. A lot of these gains in market cap are because of Ballmer's stewardship.
He was a bridge between the old Microsoft, which was focused on desktop PC software, and the new Microsoft. There'd be no Microsoft Azure cloud or Office 365 without Ballmer's decision to invest in the cloud. The payback wasn't immediately obvious: Amazon Web Services hadn't yet shown up in a positive way on Amazon's financials, and other cloud-based software businesses like Salesforce were criticized for their lack of profits.
So these bets looked like signing up for a lifetime of negative gross margins for many investors. Investors gnashed their teeth at the prospect of customers no longer profitably buying Microsoft software on CDs.
Yet, Ballmer stayed the course. Nadella would not be the CEO of Microsoft today if Ballmer had not given him the resources he needed to lead the cloud group prior to his getting the top job.
Back in October 2007, Ballmer green-lit a $240 million investment in Facebook at a $15 billion valuation. Critics assailed it as a preposterously high valuation for a three-and-a-half year old company and yet another sign that Ballmer was spending recklessly like a drunken sailor. Although Microsoft later sold its stake and is no longer listed as a shareholder by FactSet, the bet was a great one: Facebook is now worth over $500 billion.
The activist hedge fund ValueAct reportedly pushed for Ballmer's ouster. They had a $2 billion stake in Microsoft in early 2013 which helped get them a board seat.  Five years later, their representative on the Microsoft board, Morfit Mason, decided not to seek re-election in 2017. ValueAct will be able to sell its remaining stake worth $800 million on the open market. That stake would have been worth around $270 million back in 2013. That means ValueAct has already sold 87% of its original $2 billion stake earlier at lower prices along the way.
Over this same time, Ballmer  has said he's sold none of his 330 million shares. That means his $10 billion stake in Microsoft is worth about $30 billion today.
Oh, and Ballmer bought the LA Clippers basketball team in between for $2 billion, which critics howled was a dramatic overpay by Ballmer. In the last few months, two other NBA teams -- the Houston Rockets and Brooklyn Nets -- have traded for well over $2 billion.
We have all had hits and misses in our investment and management careers. Warren Buffett famously said he only needed to be right 51% of the time to be considered a great investor.
And Ballmer had his sins. He was too slow in mobile. He tried to match and surpass Google with Bing and that didn't work out. He bought Nokia's handset division right before he left and Nadella quickly reversed course later.
But Ballmer made a lot of money for shareholders, he never had to overpay for patents because he acquired them all along, and he pointed the company in the directions which have allowed it to become a $700 billion business today.
He still gets maligned as an enthusiastic dunce. He should be properly remembered for setting the company on its current trajectory.
And when was the last time you met a dunce who, according to Bloomberg, is currently worth $35.9 billion?

87,2018-01-18,"The 50 most innovative companies to work for in 2018  FMHR Final Trades: Western Digital, Microsoft, American Airlines, GE  ","For the second consecutive year, Apple and Google topped the list of the 50 most innovative companies, according to the Boston Consulting Group.
 The companies at the top of the list shifted just slightly from last year. Microsoft jumped up by one spot to take third place, while electric-car company Tesla fell from No. 3 to sixth place. Retail giant Amazon climbed from fifth place to fourth place, and Netflix, which made the top 10 in 2017, fell to No. 13.
In the most recent report, two new companies managed to push their way into the top 10: ride-hailing app Uber and e-commerce site Alibaba.
 Geographically, North America produced the most innovative companies, with 27 featured on the list. Europe produced 16 entrants, up from 10 last year.
The travel and transportation sector also expanded its showing on the 2018 list, with companies such as Uber, Tesla, SpaceX and Airbnb included.

 });
 The firm found that the most innovative companies have been fueled by digital technologies. For example, they prioritize mobile products, digital design, big data and also quickly adapt to technological advances. They also tend to develop and test new products faster and more cheaply than other companies.
According to the research, the biggest difference between the most innovative companies and the companies that appear much lower on the list is how heavily they have incorporated these digital processes into their businesses. 
""While 79 percent of strong innovators reported that they had properly digitized innovation processes, only 29 percent of weak innovators make the same claim,"" the study reports.

 Last year, the most innovative companies were those that brought in new ideas from outside sources such as social media and had open and collaborative work environments.
Finally, the research notes that business leaders at the most innovative companies do five key things that set them apart from their competition:
1. Leaders dedicate resources: They realize the importance of digital and invest accordingly.
2. Leaders invest in speed: They test ideas earlier and launch products quickly.
3. Leaders take smart risks: They make big bets that are high-risk but also high-reward.
4. Leaders invest in data: They mine and analyze data to glean insight for their products.
5. Leaders secure top talent: They acquire and develop talent across the company.

88,2018-01-19,These marketing chiefs are going to Davos — and here’s why  ,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, might not seem like the natural place for marketing, given its ambition to ""improve the state of the world"" in regards to issues such as global inequality and climate change.
 But included in the 92-page official participant list are several chief marketing officers (CMOs) who are due to attend this year's event, which begins on Tuesday.
They include CMOs from Microsoft, Huawei, AT&T, Unilever, Sberbank and technology company ABB, as well as Davos regular Martin Sorrell, chief executive of agency group WPP, senior executives from the Dentsu Aegis group and Grey advertising, plus a delegation from ad tech company Salesforce.
 Miki Tsusaka, CMO and managing director at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in Tokyo, has been going to WEF for seven years. It's an opportunity to meet clients and get inspiration from leaders at the event, as well as mix with other marketers, she said. ""I do meet with the CMOs when I'm there, there's a little bit of a club,"" she told CNBC by phone.
Topics she expects to cover include squeezed marketing spend — ""No-one says 'I have too much budget'"" — and the rush to hire or train people in new digital communications. ""You have large organizations that have been marketing one way, then all of a sudden your marketing budgets above-the-line (in paid-for media) and below-the-line (such as for email marketing) go digital from (being) traditional and that talent pool doesn't change overnight,"" she said.

 The gender inequality debate in advertising

 ""The marketing 'tech stack' is incredible. It used to be Google and Facebook and now new startups and software companies allow you to do much more scientific marketing. It's been a breathtaking change in the past five years,"" she added.
 WEF partners
 WEF is largely funded by businesses that join the Forum as members and partners. Fees range from 60,000 Swiss francs ($62,243) to 600,000 Swiss francs (around $622,000) ""depending on the level of engagement.""
BCG is a ""strategic partner"" of Davos, as is Unilever, which has six delegates on the list. For Keith Weed, Unilever's CMO, Davos is one of two major events he attends each year, the other being the Cannes Lions advertising festival.
At WEF 2017, the company published research on how gender stereotypes hold women back, and at Cannes last June it launched the ""Unstereotype Alliance,"" a group aiming to remove sexism in advertising, in partnership with Mars, Johnson & Johnson, Diageo and others.
At Davos this year, Weed is taking part in a panel put together by campaigning organization the Female Quotient, on how to ""affect positive change,"" along with other senior marketers, including Uber Chief Brand Officer Bozoma Saint John, Kristin Lemkau, CMO of JP Morgan Chase, and Carolyn Everson, vice-president of global marketing solutions at Facebook.
Weed didn't comment on his other plans for Davos 2018, but told CNBC by email that working with businesses at the event is a way to have a positive social and environmental impact. ""Davos provides us with a platform to build partnerships and to influence the debate,"" he said.
For Henry Gomez, chief marketing and communications officer at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE, also a WEF strategic partner), marketers have a place at Davos because they are central to business.
""When I sit at HPE's executive leadership table, I'm there as a business leader — not just a marketer,"" he told CNBC by email. ""And while technology has brought the global economy growth and opportunity, there is no doubt that social media, AI, blockchain and other technological developments also present challenges. When it comes to determining responses, marketers are at the center of the action.
""Davos is a great place for CMOs to listen, learn and contribute.""
HPE has five delegates on the list, and will host a breakfast with UPS on Tuesday looking at how businesses can best find value from ""the data explosion,"" and Gomez will also meet HPE customers.
Ultimately, WEF is a place to get inspiration, Tsusaka said. ""A lot of CMOs are there both to get the word out on what they stand, for but also digest like a sponge all the incredible things that are happening.""

Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith speaks during the annual Microsoft shareholders meeting in Bellevue, Washington on November 29, 2017.
 Microsoft is pushing for a new set of global norms to try and police government activity in cyberspace, following a spate of high-profile cyberattacks.
 Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, the tech giant's president Brad Smith said Friday: ""This is supposed to be a time of peace… so the world has literally, in that regard, been turned upside down from protecting civilians in times of war to attacking civilians in times of peace.""Following a series of global cyberattacks in 2017, Smith said leading tech firms should work alongside political leaders to reassess the current regulations. He added that while the more an international body could apply these same regulations ""the better,"" additional laws would also be necessary.""We can identify the gaps and then we need to fill those gaps in with, as we've said, a new Digital Geneva Convention,"" he said.
 Uptick in cyberattacks
 In recent years, cyberattacks have increasingly been adopted by governments to achieve foreign policy or national security objectives. However, despite an uptick in attacks on governments, infrastructure and political institutions, relatively few international agreements currently exist to tackle cyberattacks.Smith first called for a Digital Geneva Convention in February 2017, shortly after the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign that was tainted by the hacking and disclosure of Democratic Party emails.U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia carried out the attacks in an attempt to help President Donald Trump to win. In March, Russian President Vladimir Putin said accusations Moscow interfered with the election were ""lies"" used for ""domestic American politics.""

For example, billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has said AI will be more dangerous than North Korea. Legendary physicist Stephen Hawking says that AI has the potential to be the ""worst event in the history of our civilization.""
 But billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has added a bit of levity to the conversation. Gates says AI will mean longer vacations.
""Well, certainly we can look forward to the idea that vacations will be longer at some point,"" says Gates, speaking to FOX Business Network on Thursday at the World Economic Forum. Machine learning will make humans more productive and therefore able to accomplish the same amount of work in less time. That's a good thing, says Gates.
 ""The purpose of humanity is not just to sit behind a counter and sell things. More free time is not a terrible thing,"" says Gates.
Surveillance, security and transcription are several areas where machine learning will make things faster and cheaper.

 ""AI is simply better software,"" Gates continues. ""In these high value environments — whether it is an operating room, a jail, a factory, a courthouse — you will be able to transcribe everything that is being said, and you will be able to see things if they are safety violations even a construction site.
""And so you will be far more efficient in using resources, you will be far more aware of what is going on, and it is very cheap now because computers can see and hear as well as humans can.""
Ideally, that freed up labor can go to industries that need it.
""This is a problem of excess, ... so can you redirect people to help the elderly, to reduce class size, to help out kids with special needs? You will have the resources because you will just be so much more productive,"" says Gates.

 The transition will not be easy, says Gates. He says the government may need to create a safety net that allows employees to be retrained. That will be hard, though, because the rate of change in coming decades will be faster than it has been before. So the percentage of workers who need retraining will be high.
Tesla boss Musk has said he thinks the only option the government will have is to pay people a cash handout to live.
""There is a pretty good chance we end up with a universal basic income, or something like that, due to automation,"" says Musk to CNBC in Nov. 2016, referring to programs through which governments pay their citizens a monthly stipend, regardless of employment. ""Yeah, I am not sure what else one would do. I think that is what would happen.""
Gates did not suggest a universal basic income in conversation with FOX at Davos.
This is not the first time Gates has said that increasing productivity per worker will be good for society. At Columbia University in 2017, Gates and his billionaire buddy Warren Buffett discussed the topic.
""The idea of more output per capita — which is what the progress is made on productivity — that that should be harmful to society is crazy,"" says Buffett,  speaking at the Facebook Live event. ""If one person could push a button and turn out everything we turn out now, is that good for the world or bad for the world?"" asks Buffett, the CEO of investment house Berkshire Hathaway. ""You would free up all kinds of possibilities for everything else.""
""The macro picture that it enables is an opportunity,"" agrees Gates at the Columbia event. But, he adds, it ""really forces us to look at the individuals affected and take those extra resources and make sure they are directed to them in terms of re-education and income policies.""

 Ahead of Microsoft earnings, why the company is a 'buy'   
 4:13  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  01:28 
 Microsoft is set to report quarterly earnings Wednesday after the bell, and one trader is bullish on the name in part because of the tech giant's foray into the world of blockchain technology.  The stock, which hit an all-time high Monday, looks well-positioned into earnings, said Michael Bapis, partner and managing director at the Bapis Group at HighTower Advisors, Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" Here are his reasons why.  • Microsoft has made strides in the blockchain technology space. Last year the company was involved in a blockchain initiative related to marine insurance.  • The company has, too, expanded its footprint in the cloud computing and gaming space. On Monday, Microsoft said it had acquired a start-up with cloud-based tools for game developers.  • KeyBanc analysts wrote earlier this month that Amazon lost cloud market share to Microsoft in the fourth quarter.  The stock fell 1 percent Tuesday, closing negative for its second straight day, amid a broad market sell-off.  Bottom line: One trader is bullish on Microsoft ahead of its quarterly earnings report.

 Biggest names in tech to report earnings. But are any of the stocks worth a buy?   
 4:25  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  03:11 
 Brace yourself for a tech earnings wave over the next two days as some of the biggest names on Wall Street open their books to scrutiny.
 Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet all report this week. The five companies make up more than 40 percent of the Nasdaq 100.
Piper Jaffray's Craig Johnson has sifted through the bunch and picked one he thinks has the best potential: Apple.
 ""Clearly it's a great company,"" Johnson told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday. ""It hasn't gotten as extended as what we've seen with other companies in the tech landscape.""
Apple has endured a sharp pullback this year, siloed off from a broader market rally that lifted the S&P 500 to new records this year. Its shares slumped 4 percent last week, its worst performance since September, after several reports of weaker iPhone demand in recent months. Apple's signature smartphone is the largest contributor to sales.
Its recent decline has pulled its price-to-earnings ratio back below 15 to trade at 14.2 times forward earnings this week, its lowest level since October. By comparison, the Technology Select Sector ETF trades at 18.9 times forward earnings and the S&P 500 18.6 times forward earnings.
Compare Apple to some of the darlings of the tech space. The FANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet — trade at a far higher premium relative to earnings. Amazon holds the highest P/E at an eye-popping 168 times forward earnings and Alphabet the lowest at 28 times.
""They've all gotten fairly extended, a lot of the charts are starting to look a bit parabolic, almost going straight up,"" Johnson said of the general tech rally.
Tech gains carried the market in 2017. Facebook ended the year with its second-best annual performance since going public in 2013; earnings beats and a surprise purchase of Whole Foods fueled Amazon's 56 percent; steady subscriber growth helped Netflix add 55 percent; and Google rose 33 percent in its third straight year of gains. The XLK Tech ETF rallied 32 percent in 2017, exceeding the S&P 500's 19 percent gain.
For Michael Bapis, managing director at HighTower Advisors' Bapis Group, any gains for the rest of the tech sector will stem from product innovation in the last quarter and beyond.
""Reinventing yourself in today's technology world is one of the crucial components to earnings releases,"" he said on ""Trading Nation."" ""What's the next product they're developing? I think at the beginning of the year coming out, they should be focused on certain technologies that maybe no one is.""
For example, Bapis is keeping an eye on Microsoft for any announcements tied to new gaming or blockchain technology. Microsoft is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell Wednesday, as do eBay, Microsoft, PayPal, Qualcomm and Symantec.
Thursday's session is just as busy: Alibaba is before the opening bell, and Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and GoPro report after the closing.
Correction: An earlier version misstated when Alibaba reports earnings. It is before the opening bell on Thursday.

 Microsoft beats on bottom line   
 5:12  PM ET Wed, 31 Jan 2018 |  00:54 
 Microsoft stock fell by more than 2 percent immediately after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of its 2018 fiscal year -- which ended on December 31 -- after the bell on Wednesday. After the company's conference call with analysts, the stock was trading about 0.3 percent above the $95.01 closing price.
 Earnings: 96 cents per share, vs. 86 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $28.92 billion, vs. $28.40 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. 
There was a $13.8 billion one-time accounting charge for Microsoft in the quarter as a result of recent changes to the U.S. tax code.
 But overall, Microsoft's revenue was up 12 percent year over year, according to Wednesday's earnings statement. Microsoft's biggest business segment, More Personal Computing, which includes Windows, devices, gaming and search advertising, grew 2 percent, with $12.17 billion in revenue. That's above the FactSet consensus estimate of $12.02 billion in revenue for More Personal Computing.
Gaming revenue for the quarter was up 8 percent, thanks to the new availability of Microsoft's Xbox One X gaming console.
The Productivity and Business Processes segment, including Office, Dynamics and LinkedIn, increased by 25 percent with revenue of $8.95 billion, above the $8.86 billion FactSet estimate. And the Intelligent Cloud business, which contains Azure, Windows Server and SQL Server, produced $7.80 billion in revenue, giving it a 15 percent growth rate. That's above FactSet's $7.51 billion estimate for the segment.
 In Wednesday's statement Microsoft, as usual, didn't specify how much revenue Azure brought in, but it did provide a growth rate. Azure's revenue was up by 98 percent in the quarter, and compute usage more than doubled. In the quarter Microsoft's Azure public cloud gained share from market leader Amazon Web Services, KeyBanc analysts estimated earlier this month.
Microsoft expects to have $25.25-25.95 billion in revenue in its fiscal third quarter, and that midpoint is just a bit higher than the Thomson Reuters analyst estimate.
And tax changes should result in a 16 percent effective tax rate, plus or minus 2 percent, in the fiscal second half of 2018, CFO Amy Hood said on Wednesday's conference call. In Microsoft's fiscal first quarter, the rate was 18 percent. The company expects to have an effective tax rate ""slightly below"" the new 21 percent corporate rate in its 2019 fiscal year, Hood said. In the weeks leading up to the earnings report, some analysts were suggesting that decreases in the effective tax rate could lead to gains in Microsoft's earnings per share.
 In a Jan. 28 note the KeyBanc analysts said they were expecting Microsoft to report a $21.8 billion annualized revenue run rate -- the final month of the quarter, multiplied by 12 -- for Commercial Cloud, which includes Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics 365, which would imply 50 percent growth. For the second quarter Microsoft did not report annualized revenue run rate for commercial cloud.
But Microsoft did say that in the fiscal second quarter it picked up commercial cloud revenue totaling $5.3 billion, which was up 56 percent year over year, and up sequentially from $5 billion in the fiscal first quarter. The gross margin for commercial cloud in the quarter was 55 percent, up from 48 percent for the same period last year; Microsoft said that gain was driven by Azure and Office 365.
Microsoft said its number of Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 29.2 million, up from 28 million one quarter earlier.
And the company addressed the recent Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities in the risk factors section of its regulatory filing:
 As illustrated by the recent Spectre and Meltdown threats, our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. 
Microsoft stock is up around 10 percent since the beginning of the year. In the fiscal second quarter Microsoft announced several ways in which it was incorporating artificial intelligence into its products, appointed two new board members, and acquired the team and technology behind the ""living photo"" app Swing.

97,2018-02-06,"Microsoft is giving away cloud storage to lure users away from Box, Dropbox and Google  ","Source: Microsoft
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a company event in San Francisco in 2014.
 Microsoft is trying to lure users of cloud services from Box, Dropbox and Alphabet's Google Drive by giving them its competitive product for free.
 On Tuesday, Microsoft said users of those three file sync and sharing services can switch to OneDrive for Business without paying anything until their current contract expires. Microsoft is only running the offer for the next five months, according to a blog post from Ron Markezich, a corporate vice president.
The promotion is further proof of Microsoft's commitment to building its Office 365 lineup of cloud productivity services, including OneDrive for Business. Organizations are only eligible if they're not already OneDrive for Business or Office 365 customers, and if deployments will reach at least 500 users, Markezich wrote.
 Microsoft's offer comes a month after reports that Dropbox has filed confidentially to go public. And last week, Alphabet announced that G Suite, which includes Google Drive, has 4 million paying customers. More than 350,000 organizations currently have OneDrive, Markezich wrote. 
Commercial subscriptions to Office 365 represent a key portion of Microsoft's commercial cloud, which generated $5.3 billion in revenue in the latest quarter, up 56 percent from the prior year. Continuing growth of Office 365 commercial revenue was assumed in a recent prediction by Evercore ISI analysts that Microsoft could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2020.
 It's not the first time Microsoft has given away technology to attract business. In 2016 the company said it would hand out free licenses to its Windows Server operating system for companies that would commit to switching from VMware to Microsoft's Hyper-V server virtualization technology.

 As part of the culmination of the three-day conference, which was called #RaiseYourVoice and focused on issues of equal pay, representation and sexual harassment, the organization unveiled a list of historic pledges across a range of companies. The goal, says Allie Kline, CMO of Oath and the head of MAKERS, is for these pledges to inspire other organizations around the world to make changes to advance women in their workforces.
MAKERS is a feminist media brand backed by Verizon's Oath, which hosts more than 4,500 original interviews and more than 400 Makers Interviews. It also has a partnership program for companies, called MAKERS@, which aims to give companies tools and inspiration for their employees.

 The companies announcing pledges range from Adobe and Aetna to Microsoft, Unilever and Univision. The pledges are all unique to their brands, such as Barbie-maker Mattel pledging to launch at least 10 role model dolls each year featuring under-represented careers, ""real life Sheroes from around the world, and important women in history.""
National Geographic Global Networks CEO Courteney Monroe pledged that by the end of 2020 the number of male- and female-led companies her organization partners with, from marketing agencies to production houses, will be equal.

 ""We're going to create a high bar for ourselves and hope that it inspires companies to set a high bar for themselves, so that they can work with us.""
Monroe says this isn't just the right thing to do to help women; it will give National Geographic a competitive advantage.
""We need to reflect the consumers we serve, and the only way we're going to do that is if the leadership team and the company itself reflects that diversity. And diversity of thought is what drives results,"" says Monroe. ""The world is incredibly competitive right now. If you have a leadership team that looks the same, we're going to get stuck in the same places. The only way you're going to be able to power that and get better results is to be a diverse and inclusive company.""
 ""Diversity of thought is what drives results.""
-Courteney Monroe, CEO, National Geographic Global Networks
 In the tech industry, which has been under scrutiny for a pervasive under-representation of women, Adobe says it will reach pay parity between men and women globally this year. IT-services company Cognizant pledges to ""help close the gender gap in tech by getting more girls into STEM and by equipping 12,000 Cognizant women across North America in 2018 with the critical digital skills needed to advance at all stages of their careers.""
A number of pledges are focused on how women are represented. L'Oreal's SVP of Strategic Investments and Creative Solutions Nadine McHugh says she is committed to using the buying power of the company's media investments to accurately portray women. Meanwhile, Accenture announced a commitment to end gender bias and cultural stereotypes in marketing and advertising.
""The goal is to eliminate it in everything we do and produce at Accenture, and to work with our external peers and colleagues to do the same,"" said Accenture's Chief Marketing and Communications Officer Roxanne Taylor.
