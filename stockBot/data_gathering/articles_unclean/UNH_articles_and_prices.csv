UnitedHealth office
 Shares of U.S. health insurer UnitedHealth dropped Friday following news that the Justice Department has joined a lawsuit filed by a former executive. The lawsuit accuses the company of overcharging Medicare by hundreds of millions of dollars.
 UnitedHealth stock, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, ended the session about 3.7 percent lower, closing at $157.62 a share.
Shares of several other insurers also fell. They include Aetna, Humana, and WellCare, which whistle blower Benjamin Poehling, the former UNH executive, has also sued.
 The Justice Department has not joined the allegations that Poehling has made against those three companies.
Poehling alleges that UnitedHealth gamed an insurance program known as risk adjustment by claiming members of Medicare managed care plans were treated for conditions that they either did not actually have, or which they were not treated for.
His suit in Los Angeles federal court claims that Medicare, the federally run health-coverage system for primarily senior citizens, has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to UnitedHealth and its affiliates for false claims.
UnitedHealth has denied Poehling's allegations.

 The biggest institutional investors are gobbling up this stock   
 4:41  PM ET Thu, 23 March 2017 |  01:03 
 Institutional investors are betting big on UnitedHealth Group.
 The insurance and services company has positioned itself to profit amid the uncertainty of the Affordable Care Act's future, analysts say. Ownership among institutional investors has jumped over the past year, and it's now the tenth-most widely held company, according to a fresh report from data and analysis firm eVestment.
UnitedHealth jumped from 21st place in the third quarter of 2016, according to the report. In the fourth quarter, it was held by 13.8 percent of funds. The recent dust-up surrounding the GOP's attempt to replace Obamacare could make it that much more attractive to investors.
 The rally began last spring when UnitedHealth was one of the first to announce it would be dropping out of the health insurance exchanges created under Obamacare. In January 2017, UnitedHealth exceeded analysts' earnings expectations, with a fourth-quarter profit of $2.11 per share, four cents over estimates. The company took a charge for losses on the health exchanges last year, but executives said they don't expect exchange plans to affect results in 2017.
""Regardless of where you are philosophically on the healthcare debate, changes to healthcare in the United States offer both opportunities and challenges for health insurance companies,"" said Mark Scott, a spokesman for eVestment. ""So far, the institutional market seems to be applauding UnitedHealth's moves.""
Shares in the company have climbed nearly 35 percent over the past year.
 ""Healthcare, along with infrastructure, manufacturing and a few other key areas that may see changes given priorities in Washington, are market segments eVestment will be following closely over time,"" Scott said.
Intel also made it on the eVestment list of the top 20 most widely held stocks, coming in at number 19. Within the top 20 list, Apple fell two places over the year to number three. Facebook and Amazon both moved up a few slots and Taiwan Semiconductor took 17th place in the fourth quarter, up from 32nd the year prior.
AT&T and Home Depot were the two bumped off the leaders list.

 UnitedHealth Group, Anthem and Humana would be among the big winners if the Trump-Ryan health-care bill is approved by the House on Friday, Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte told CNBC. 
 Gupte, an equity research senior analyst covering health care, said the pharmaceutical industry also would come out well under the American Health Care Act.
""They didn't have drug pricing legislation built into this,"" Gupte said on ""Squawk Box.""
 ""They got a tax break. Maybe they can give some of that back to consumers in the form of co-pay assistance that may get the government off their back and the president's populist agenda gets served as well,"" she said.
The pharma industry has been scrutinized by lawmakers after leading drugmakers hiked their prices, sometimes by triple digits. Some analyst, however, say those companies are outliers.
The House is expected to vote Friday on the bill backed by President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama's  Affordable Care Act. 
The vote was postponed Thursday after Republican leaders failed to rally enough support to pass the bill because of a rebellion by the conservative Freedom Caucus and moderate Republicans. Trump has demanded that the House approve the plan as is Friday or leave Obamacare in place.

3,2017-04-18,UnitedHealth raises its 2017 outlook despite the uncertainty over Obamacare repeal  ,"Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Representatives speak with customers at a UnitedHealthcare location in the Queens, New York.
 UnitedHealth Group said it is confident it will post better-than-expected growth for the full year, regardless of what happens with health reform in Washington.
 ""In the longer term, policy changes that improve health care and the health system play to our strengths,"" said United CEO Stephen Hemsley on the company's earnings conference call Tuesday.
The nation's largest insurer's first-quarter earnings and revenues were stronger than expected, helped in part by its decision to exit the Obamacare individual market this year. 
 UnitedHealth executives say they have been engaged in talks with GOP officials in Washington about reforms that will help bring down health insurance costs, and they put an emphasis on the need to repeal the Affordable Care Act's tax on all health plans, including government health coverage.
""Affordability can be improved most in the immediate term through lower taxes. We hope Congress acts soon to permanently repeal the health insurance tax before it further worsens consumers' premiums, state budgets and seniors' benefits,"" said Hemsley. ""We have no insight as to whether that will or will not occur.""
While the ACA tax was suspended for 2017, United is pricing it into its plans for next year.
""Our plans continue to assume the tax will return in 2018, which will raise premiums and/or reduce benefits for commercial businesses, states and our nation's senior population,"" Hemsley said.
United reported adjusted first-quarter profits of $2.23 per share, 20 cents above the Thomas Reuters consensus estimate of $2.17 per share. On the top line, $48.7 billion in revenues also exceeded analyst expectations.
The company added 480,000 new members during the quarter in its commercial group insurance division, and one million new members in its Medicaid and Medicare Advantage plans.
The biggest driver of profit growth was the Optum health services unit, which posted 16 percent earnings growth for the quarter, and has tripled revenues since the launch of the division in 2011.
The insurer's diversified health-care strategy, bringing together insurance, pharmacy, primary care and data services has paid off in increased market share over the last two years, while its largest competitors Anthem and Cigna and Aetna and Humana pursued ill-fated mega-mergers.
""We are providing increasingly differentiated value to a more diverse set of markets than other and we are building deeper relationships with customers,"" said Hemsley.
United raised its full year 2017 revenue expectations to $200 billion, slightly above analyst expectations. By contrast, the combined 2017 full year revenue estimates for its three largest competitors Anthem, Aetna and Humana is $180 billion.

7,2017-05-25,UnitedHealth and Merck strike a deal to explore linking payments to drug performance  Seven iQ 100 members hit all-time highs  ,"Steve Cole | E+ | Getty Images
 UnitedHealth Group's Optum unit has signed a multiyear agreement with Merck to develop a better way to reimburse drugmakers based on how well their drugs improve a patient's health.
 ""The aim is to identify opportunities where we can align value and payment,"" on high-cost treatments, said Curt Medeiros, president of Optum Life Sciences. ""There's a lot of focus on high-cost specialty areas like oncology, but also in chronic conditions that affect a broad set of the population like diabetes.""
UnitedHealth and other insurers have been pushing hospitals and doctors toward new value-based reimbursement contracts for more than five years. In the last 18 months, the health insurance industry has begun to focus more on new payment deals with drugmakers to enter outcomes-based risk sharing agreements, or OBRSAs.
 Medicare plan provider Humana has more than a dozen agreements with pharmaceutical companies covering nearly two dozen drugs. Aetna announced a deal with Merck earlier this year. Cigna, Humana and others have deals in place with Swiss drugmaker Novartis for its high-cost heart drug Entresto.
UnitedHealth is targeting signing another five to 10 outcomes-based deals this year.
""The level of interest in our pharma and our biotech clients has increased significantly, so the amount of opportunities out there has really grown,"" said Medeiros. ""Cost pressure ... is probably the largest driver.""
While the future of federal funding for health programs like Medicaid remains up for debate in Congress, one thing is clear — the health industry is going to come under greater pressure to lower costs. And rising specialty-drug prices have put pharmaceutical companies in the crosshairs of private payers and the government.
President Donald Trump has said he would like to see federal programs such as Medicare have the ability to negotiate lower drug prices. It is an issue that has seen some bipartisan support. For the pharmaceutical industry, OBRSAs could be a way to get out in front of potential drug-price controls.
""The collaboration between Merck and Optum will help advance both organizations' common goals of improving patient health outcomes, expanding access to innovative therapies, and ensuring the best use of health care spending,"" said Susan Shiff, senior vice president at Merck, in the companies' announcement.
The actual returns on the program could still be years away, but UnitedHealth and Merck say they will share their data publicly with others in the industry to develop better payment models.
""The ability to drive down the cost — ultimately to the consumer — is the long-term objective,"" said Medeiros. ""How much, at this time, we don't know.""

 Cramer Remix: Don’t let the action in UnitedHealth fool you   
 7:20  PM ET Tue, 18 July 2017 |  01:32 
 The GOP's failure to pass health care reform has shaken the market, so much so that Jim Cramer made the case for cordoning off Wall Street from Main Street.
 While Wall Street obsesses over the FANG stocks, Cramer's acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet, for being the few plays immune to Washington's turmoil, strong earnings reports are overlooked or even met with disdain.
""That's why I want to sing the praises of a bunch of companies that have reported this earnings season, companies that would be getting a lot more attention and love right now if Washington wasn't making us feel so pessimistic, so cynical,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
 One such company was UnitedHealth. The largest health care provider in the country, UnitedHealth reported its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, topping the Street's estimates.
Cramer's go-to UnitedHealth analyst, Mizuho Securities' Sheryl Skolnik, called it ""an outstanding report,"" but the stock closed up only 0.2 percent, a mere 50 cents.
""Don't let its measly 50-cent gain fool you,"" Cramer warned. ""United Health reported a great quarter. Its stock's a buy.""
 Off the Charts: The Forgotten Ones
 Adam Jeffery | CNBC 
A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
 The technology sector may be seen by the stock market as the hotbed of growth and the rally's main driver, but Cramer wanted to put its performance into context.
""It's not like tech is vaulting into the stratosphere while everything else does nothing,"" Cramer said. ""What we have here is a broad-based rally that's taking up all sorts of stocks, proving once again that diversification is the only free lunch in this business.""
In the last six months, the tech stocks in the S&P 500 rallied 15 percent on average, but the health care stocks rose over 13 percent, with industrials, materials and financials up 8 percent.
So Cramer used the charts of technician Bob Moreno, publisher of RightViewTrading.com and Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com, to highlight some of the overlooked sectors' top names.
 Netflix: 3 Reasons Why
 Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images
The Netflix app on an Apple iPad mini tablet computer.
 In light of Netflix's strong earnings report, Cramer knows CEO Reed Hastings understands three things: content can be king, people love bargains, and bigwig money managers will invest in internet stocks with promise.
""Netflix is, to the naked eye, a two-pronged success. If your company can produce local content that people love worldwide and you only charge them $8 or €8 a month, you'll land and expand. You'll grow and grow and grow,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
But the third element, the willingness of Wall Street financiers to catch and pay for the next hot internet-related trend, was what really drove Hastings' success so far, Cramer said.
 A Windy Road for Straight Path Communications
 Cramer also analyzed the action in Straight Path Communications, using the stock's moves to make the case that markets are not, as some economic theories say, perfectly efficient.
Verizon recently announced it would buy Straight Path, which owns bandwidth licenses for 5G networks, for $184 a share after a bidding war with AT&T that sent the stock price soaring from $36, where it stood before the bids began.
""The action in Straight Path Communications has been very exciting, but I wouldn't call it efficient,"" Cramer said. ""The reason you can make money in individual stocks — as long as you do the homework — is that markets are rarely super efficient, the conventional wisdom is often wrong, and there are often huge opportunities there for the taking if you know where to look. Straight Path had a lot going against it, sure, absolutely, but at the end of the day they owned some insanely valuable spectrum assets that ultimately made AT&T and Verizon willing to pay through the nose to buy the whole company. That's what really mattered.""
 Prologis CEO: Broader than E-Commerce
 Finally, Cramer spoke with Hamid Moghadam, the CEO of warehouses real estate investment trust Prologis, to check in on the REIT space and see how the industry is building on the rise of e-commerce.
""It's really broader than e-commerce,"" Moghadam told Cramer on Tuesday. ""I mean, it's all consumption-related and, you know, supply has been very disciplined in the last couple of years and demand has been really strong, so the combination of those two [has] made the best market of my career.""
And as data becomes increasingly important to technology companies working on the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, Moghadam said his company is well-positioned to take advantage of the information boom.
""I think in 10 years we're going to think about our businesses, not just the real estate business, but also a very significant data business, and I think that data is going to help our customers, it's going to help our own decision-making, and who knows? If we're really successful at this, it could be a separate business that could be valued separately by the market,"" the CEO said. ""It's way too early to get that far ahead of our speed, but I'm really excited about those opportunities.""
 Lightning Round: Don't Give Up on UPS
 In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some callers' favorite stocks, including:
United Parcel Service: ""UPS is getting its act together and they are levered to e-commerce. No, you don't want to sell. We're not going with that. We like UPS.""
McKesson Corporation: ""I have to tell you, long term buy. The words 'long term' were crucial because short term, I don't like the expectations there.""

Amir Rubin, new CEO of One Medical
 One Medical, the venture-backed primary care group with 60 clinics nationwide, has tapped an executive from health insurance giant UnitedHealth Group to be its new CEO. 
 Amir Rubin, an executive vice president in UnitedHealth's Optum division, was named to the top post on Tuesday. Tom X. Lee, who founded One Medical and ran the company for a decade, will stay on as executive chairman. 
Rubin said he intends to spend his first few months building out the business by opening new clinics and signing up more corporate customers. One Medical sells memberships to individuals as well as to companies that offer its primary care service as a benefit. 
 ""We have seen a tremendous (revenue) growth in our corporate relationships,"" Rubin said in an interview.
Individual members pay an annual fee of $149 to $199 and get access to same-day appointments that they can book online or with the mobile app. Corporate rates vary based on the number of employees and the extent of their benefits. 
Rubin, who was previously CEO of Stanford Health Care, expects the enterprise business to become a bigger part of One Medical's overall revenue. One way the company is attracting large employers is by opening small clinics on corporate campuses, similar to a model used by start-ups like Crossover Health.
One Medical has raised more than $180 million in financing from investors including Benchmark and Alphabet's GV. In addition to online scheduling, the company offers a virtual medical team, a suite of mobile apps and has built its own electronic medical system. 
Rubin has no immediate plans to raise further rounds of financing even with the company's ""ambitions for continued growth.""
Rubin didn't rule out future acquisitions of digital health start-ups. In 2016, the company bought Rise, a nutrition coaching app, to bolster its digital medicine offerings. Rubin also said he ""doesn't anticipate"" a sale to a major health system, despite a clear trend in the market toward consolidation.
The company declined to share its valuation, though it's reportedly worth at least $1 billion.
Correction: This article originally missatated Rubin's title at UnitedHealth. He was an executive vice president at its Optum division.

 The euro sank about 1 percent against the dollar after the European Central Bank announced plans to trim its monthly asset purchase program. The bank noted that the program could be extended again if economic conditions turn sour.
But if the dollar's strength over the euro continues, investors may be looking to make some key trades here in the U.S. A weakening euro reduces the purchasing power of Europeans to buy U.S. exports, giving a competitive advantage to companies that tend to sell domestically.
 Using hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, CNBC analyzed 10 years of historical trends each time the euro fell 2 percent or more against the dollar in one month. That has happened more than 50 times over the past decade.
 During those months, here's what happened to the overall market:
 The data show that both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average tend to trade positive as the euro declines.
 Companies such as United Health and Home Depot that typically serve the U.S. market are among the biggest gainers. Both stocks were up about 0.2 percent Thursday after the greenback gained ground over the euro. Boeing, which led the Dow higher Thursday morning, also tends to benefit from a weaker euro.
 But there are also losers that accompany a stronger dollar, as Europeans are forced to pay more for imported goods and services as the exchange rate moves. U.S. companies that conduct a significant portion of their business overseas, such as Caterpillar, tend to post negative returns as the cost to import American goods rises.

 UnitedHealth falls on mixed 2018 guidance   
 6:32  PM ET Mon, 27 Nov 2017 |  00:55 
 UnitedHealth Group shares dipped in after-hours trading Monday on news that the managed health-care giant issued a disappointing earnings forecast. 
 Shares dropped more than 2 percent in trading after the bell, before regaining ground. Shares were recently down about 1.5 percent. 
UnitedHealth projected revenue for 2018 that would be only marginally higher than most earlier analyst estimates, which called for revenue of $218 billion next year.
 The company estimates revenue will be between $223 billion and $225 billion for 2018.
UnitedHealth projected adjusted net earnings of $10.55 to $10.85 per share for next year. Analysts on average had estimated the company's adjusted net earnings would be $10.81 per share in 2018.
Net earnings would be between $10 and $10.30 per share next fiscal year, the company said.
UnitedHealth also said it expects revenue for fiscal year 2017 will exceed $200 billion, with adjusted net earnings approaching $10 per share. According to Thomson Reuters, the company was expected to earn $9.99 a share, on an adjusted basis, on revenue of $200 billion. 
UnitedHealth expects net earnings to approach $9.45 per share.
Cash flows from operations are projected to be in the range of $13.3 billion to $13.8 billion in 2018, the company said.

 For UnitedHealth Group the focus next year is more about getting ahead of potential competition from tech heavyweights such as Amazon and Apple than getting bogged down in the twists and turns of health reform in Washington. That was the underlying message from new CEO David Wichmann at the health-care company's analyst day in New York. ""People have asked me, 'What's going to be different now that you're CEO?' My short response is that very little will change and everything will change,"" said Wichmann, who succeeded Stephen Hemsley as chief executive in September, after serving as UnitedHealth's chief financial officer for five years. ""This is a restless company, dissatisfied with the status quo in health care,"" he said. UnitedHealth is forecasting 2018 revenue growth of roughly 12 percent, to $223 billion to $225 billion, which is above the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. The main growth drivers are expected to be the company's Optum data analytics and health-care services business, and growth in the Medicare Advantage membership on the health insurance side. Executives said the return of the Obamacare health insurance tax next year will pose a 75-cent-per-share headwind to profits. They are projecting full-year earnings of $10.55 to $10.85 per share, excluding items. Beyond its financial goals, UnitedHealth executives outlined a number of programs that tap Optum's data and apply machine learning to improve patient engagement and outcomes with both commercial employer members and Medicare enrollees. Asked about the potential threat of Amazon and other tech giants entering the health-care market, Larry Renfro, the chief executive of the insurer's Optum unit, said the company is trying to catch up when it comes to early-stage companies. Renfro announced the launch of Optum Ventures during the meeting, which is committing $250 million to fund digital health-care firms. Among the fund's first investments are Apervita, a cloud-based analytics platform; SHYFT Analytics, a cloud-based pharmaceutical research platform, and Mindstrong Health, which uses machine learning to help patients assess their mental health disorders through their smartphones. ""Optum Ventures is uniquely positioned to help develop and grow start-ups and early-stage companies through capital investment, Optum's decades of experience in health care, and our access to the health-care marketplace,"" said Renfro. In addition, the firm recently completed its $1.3 billion acquisition of the Advisory Board's consulting unit. As a result of that deal, UnitedHealth has a 5.5 percent stake in hospital IT firm Evolent Health, making it the firm's largest stakeholder. The Advisory Board acquisition was one of three transactions the health insurer made this year, including a $2.3 billion deal for Surgical Care Affiliates, and a $2.8 billion deal for Chilean insurer Banmedica. UnitedHealth's acquisitions have helped drive double-digit revenue growth in the current decade. In the wake of failed health insurance mergers earlier this year, some of its competitors are now eyeing the UnitedHealth model of vertical integration. Sources tell CNBC that CVS Health has explored a merger with Aetna, valued at upwards of $66 billion. Both companies will hold their investor updates next month. UnitedHealth's new CEO may not be looking over his shoulder with worry, but he told investors he's not going to rest on the company's laurels. ""We know we can perform better,"" Wichmann said. ""We are more than willing and capable of stepping up our game."" UnitedHealth's shares were down more than 1 percent in the premarket, following the company's initial guidance for 2018, but shares turned positive as the company's presentation concluded late morning, and closed Tuesday up 1.7 percent.

 UnitedHealth reports big earnings beat   
 7:14  AM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  06:35 
 UnitedHealth shares rose in premarket trading on Tuesday after the largest U.S. health insurer raised its outlook for 2018 earnings per share by more than 16 percent due to the U.S. corporate tax cuts and said it would speed up investments in data analytics and technology to better serve consumers.
 The tax benefit also helped the company raise its 2018 full-year adjusted earnings per share forecast to range between $12.30 and $12.60.
UnitedHealth had forecasted in November that 2018 adjusted earnings per share would range between $10.55 and $10.85 on a revenue of $223 billion to $225 billion.
 For the fourth quarter, UnitedHealth said Tuesday, it earned $2.59 per share, excluding items. Total revenue for the quarter rose 9.5 percent to $52.06 billion. Wall Street expected earnings of $2.51 per share on revenue of $51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters' consensus estimates.
""We think many investors were worried there could be greater reinvestment and other offsets limiting the tax benefit and we expect the market to react favorably to the updated guidance,"" Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said in a research note.
Revenue from the company's Optum business, which manages drug benefits and offers health-care data analytics services, rose 10 percent to $24.39 billion.
""There's a dot that needs to be connected between tax policy and health policy,"" said Ana Gupte, a senior health-care services analyst at Leerink Partners. Gupte has an outperform rating on United stock with a price target of $260. In Tuesday's premarket, it was trading above $234.
""Because if a portion of it falls to the bottom line and a portion of it goes to the American consumer, you have Medicare now potentially getting from a third of American seniors to about 50 percent of American seniors before the 2020 elections,"" Gupte added in an interview on ""Squawk Box.""
The company, which sells employer-based insurance as well as Medicare and Medicaid, said net earnings attributable to shareholders rose to $3.62 billion, or $3.65 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.68 billion, or $1.74 per share, a year earlier.
""We enter 2018 with both growth momentum and opportunity as a result of our focus on improving the experience of those we serve, combined with actions taken to deepen our capabilities and presence in strategic markets,"" UnitedHealth CEO David Wichmann said in the earnings release.
The quarterly earnings included a one-time tax benefit of $1.21 per share, the company said.

 Stocks on the move after Amazon, Berkshire and JP Morgan announce health-care partnership   
 8:42  AM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  02:50 
 Shares of insurer Express Scripts and other health-care related stocks slid Tuesday after Amazon, J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway announced a partnership to improve employee health.
 The three companies, led by Jeff Bezos, Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett, plan to develop ways to improve the health of their employees, with the goal of improving customer satisfaction and reducing costs.
""The three companies, which bring their scale and complementary expertise to this long-term effort, will pursue this objective through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints,"" the announcement said.
 Drug distributor Express Scripts' stock fell 5 percent by midday. Cigna was off by 6 percent, CVS Health dropped 4 percent and Walgreens Boots Alliance fell 5 percent. UnitedHealth Group also was down 4 percent and Aetna fell by about 2 percent.
Details of the new company were still unclear, but that didn't stop traders from sending these shares reeling on the notion that these three titans of business could shine a light on where these companies need lower costs.
Pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Amgen also slipped, down 3.2 percent and 3.1 percent respectively.

 ""The comments in the press release suggest that these leaders view this as an endeavor that is complex, challenging and thorny and that will take time to bear fruit,""wrote Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink Partners. ""It is unclear if this means Amazon will accelerate its entry into the pharmacy supply chain, though the quest for transparency, which is lacking currently in drug pricing and also in broader healthcare delivery in America, would point to a more transformative effort by the new entity.""
The announcement comes amid months of speculation that Amazon's Bezos would lead the e-commerce giant into the health-care space.
""The healthcare system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty,"" Bezos said in the announcement. ""Hard as it might be, reducing healthcare's burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort.""
A key issue for the Trump administration, the rising cost of health care and pharmaceuticals has frequently drawn criticism from President Donald Trump.
 Tweet
 Trump said in October that his administration would stop paying Obamacare insurers billions of dollars in reimbursements for discounts that insurers must give by law to low-income customers of their plans.
""If this winds up being the low cost provider to make insurance more affordable at employer level, could wind up being a real disruptive competitor to an industry that has not seen any new players in years/decades,"" Jefferies analyst Jared Holz said in email. ""[I'm] not going to call this [a] black swan event yet because there are few details and would be making too many assumptions but it has potential to be.""
Buffett and Dimon also commented on the new company in the press release.
""The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy. Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable,"" Berkshire's Buffett said.
""Our people want transparency, knowledge and control when it comes to managing their healthcare,"" said JP.P. Morgan's Dimon. ""The three of our companies have extraordinary resources, and our goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees.""
Shares of Amazon, J.P. Morgan, and Berkshire Hathaway were little changed.
