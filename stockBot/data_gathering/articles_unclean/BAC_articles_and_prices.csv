1,2017-06-21,"Intel faces stiffer competition from 'resurgent' Nvidia, AMD, BofA says  ","CNBC | Getty Images
Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel.
 Intel's ability to easily raise chip prices may be ending, as the company faces tougher competition from AMD and Nvidia, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch research analyst said.The bank lowered its rating on Intel to neutral from buy, predicting the company will lose market share to AMD's latest server chips and Nvidia's artificial intelligence processors.
Analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients Wednesday that AMD has introduced a set of data center server products with attractive pricing and several large customers, including Microsoft, HP, Lenovo and Baidu. His note was entitled ""Resurgent AMD, NVDA could limit INTC's price advantage.""
 Competition from AMD and Nvidia could curb Intel's ability to expand its average selling price, something that has been a key source of growth, Arya said.  ""It's early days and AMD's historical execution has been weak, but we believe increased AMD competition in servers, and share gains by NVDA in AI/accelerators, could limit INTC's expansion of its avg. selling prices (ASP)."" The analyst reduced his Intel price target to $38 from $42. The lower target would be a 9 percent gain from Tuesday's close. Intel was able to increase its data center sales by an annualized 11 percent in the past five years. However 3 to 4 percentage points of those gains per year came from price increases, he said.
In PCs, Intel's sales growth has been flat over five years as rising average sales prices offset declines in unit sales. ""Both these trends are at risk if large PC, cloud and enterprise customers now have AMD as an option,"" Arya wrote. ""Meanwhile NVDA continues to put pressure by shifting more workloads on to its graphics accelerators, and away from INTC's processors.""
Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.

 Warren Buffett just made a quick $12 billion on a clever Bank of America investment   
 11:21  AM ET Fri, 30 June 2017 |  01:00 
 Because of an astute investment made in Bank of America six years ago while the bank was struggling, Warren Buffett is about to make a quick $12 billion and become the financial institution's largest shareholder.
 Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said Friday it will exercise warrants in Bank of America that will allow it to acquire 700 million common shares in the bank at an exercise price of just $7.14 each, or about $5 billion.
Bank of America shares closed Thursday at $24.32 a share, making that stake actually worth more than $17 billion. So it's a quick $12 billion paper profit for the Oracle of Omaha.

 Warren Buffett just made a quick $12 billion on Bank of America   
 8:47  AM ET Fri, 30 June 2017 |  00:42 
 After passing the second of two annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve, Bank of America said Wednesday it would hike its annual dividend to 48 cents a share, or 12 cents a quarter, a 60 percent increase.
That was enough for Berkshire to consider exercising those warrants rather than wait until just before their expiration in 2021. 
This all goes back to Berkshire's 2011 deal to invest $5 billion in preferred shares of Bank of America, which at the time was struggling with numerous legal issues in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis. The preferred shares pay a 6 percent annual dividend, or $300 million. At a dividend of 44 cents, the common shares would pay roughly the same. At 48 cents, Berkshire would get $336 million annually.
A move to exercise the warrants would be seen as bullish for Bank of America shares, an expression of confidence by Buffett that they have upward momentum. They rose 1 percent in premarket trading Friday to $24.58. They were already up 7 percent on the week.
Bank of America said it would make the dividend increase official ""beginning in the third quarter of 2017."" That period begins Monday. Berkshire said it will exercise the warrants once that hike is official, instantly making Buffett that $12 billion, or more if the stock continues to go higher.
The Buffett-led conglomerate will also then become the bank's biggest shareholder, surpassing Vanguard, which holds 6.6 percent, about 652 million shares, according to FactSet.
In the past, Berkshire indicated it would likely not execute the warrants until just before the 2021 deadline. But in his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett signaled a change of heart.
""If the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock — now 30 cents annually — should rise above 44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common,"" he said in his annual letter to shareholders.
Berkshire is already the largest shareholder in another major financial institution: Wells Fargo. Buffett also has a sizable holding in Goldman Sachs, a stake that dates back to another shrewd investment made by the investing legend in the wake of the financial crisis.

Traders work the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
 The recent shift from skepticism to optimism may be the first sign of market euphoria that is typical toward the end of bull markets but has been notably absent thus far in the cycle.
The sell side indicator – which measures Wall Street's bullishness on stocks – has rebounded since an all-time low of 43.9 in 2012, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategist Savita Subramanian. The indicator rose by 2.4 percentage points to 56.4 in June, its highest level since 2011 and less than 2 percentage points from its 15-year average.
 ""The indicator's expected 12-month total return is +12%,"" wrote Subramanian in Monday's note. ""With the S&P 500's indicated dividend yield currently near 2%, that implies a 12-month price return of 10% and a 12-month value of 2673."" The S&P 500 is currently trading around 2,423.

The sell side indicator is a contrarian metric, implying that as Wall Street grows more bullish toward stocks, the more bearish the measurement becomes. The indicator is based on the average recommended equity allocation of Wall Street strategists as of the last business day of each month.

 Market top ahead because Fed's easy money 'no longer politically acceptable', Bank of America's Hartnett says   
 2:09  PM ET Mon,  3 July 2017 |  00:41 
 Central bank easing may no longer be politically acceptable.
 That's what Bank of America Merrill Lynch's widely followed chief investment strategist, Michael Hartnett, says in a note. 
""Central banks have exacerbated inequality via Wall St. inflation & Main St. deflation; [it's] no longer politically acceptable to stoke [the] Wall St. bubble,"" the strategist wrote last week.
 There are ""two ways to cure inequality,"" make the poor richer or the rich poorer, Hartnett added. The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are ""now tightening to make Wall St. poorer,"" likely setting up for a ""big top"" in stock markets this fall.

Last week, European and U.S. government bond yields climbed to multiweek highs after key policymakers at the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Federal Reserve separately suggested that tighter monetary policy is on the way. 
However, all three acknowledged inflation remains subdued. 
Normal business growth can no longer create inflation because of the disruptive force of technology, record high global debt, and an aging population, Hartnett said. Instead, he said, inflation will require ""radical fiscal stimulus, trade war, major increase in geopolitical risk"" and policies to ""Occupy Silicon Valley"" by redistributing its wealth, reiterating a point he made in May.

 In Hartnett's view, the lack of inflation means central banks are making a ""mistake"" by tightening, but they will still do so because they ""want volatility to return."" 
This summer will then likely mark a ""significant inflection point"" in the central bank liquidity trade that will likely set up for a ""big top"" in the autumn, Hartnett said. He recommends buying 2-year Treasurys and resources stocks, and shorting emerging market debt and technology stocks, among several other trades in preparation for a ""bout of higher yields."" 
While yields climbed last week and bank stocks rose, the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.99 percent in its worst week of the year, going back to Dec. 2. The S&P 500 fell 0.61 percent last week, its worst since April 13.
Still, ""'greed' takes longer to kill than 'fear,'"" the market strategist said. He pointed out that in the 12 months leading up to the tech bubble's peak, the Nasdaq fell more than 10 percent on six separate occasions. 
Hartnett expects the Nasdaq composite could climb above 6,666 before the end of the bull market — which he pointed out began after the S&P 500 hit a low of 666 — 666.79 per FactSet, to be precise.

A woman carrying an umbrella walks past the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York.
 Bank of America rang a warning bell Wednesday regarding all the money that has piled into passive exchange-traded funds.
 The bank says the massive popularity of ETFs may be leading us on a road to a liquidity problem. The note issued by Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Global Research department warns ""the actual shares available, or true float for S&P 500 stocks, may be grossly overestimated.""
That could lead stocks and the overall market to fluctuate more violently, especially to the downside, due to a future event affecting either a single stock, a sector or the market at large.
 Passively managed ETFs have become incredibly attractive to investors, allowing them to pick and choose baskets of stocks representing different parts of the market. According to industry groups, more than $4 trillion is now invested in ETFs.
Vanguard is the second-biggest issuer of ETFs, and it now has at least a 5 percent stake in 491 out of the stocks in the S&P 500, according to the report. That's a massive increase from a 5 percent stake in 116 stocks out of the S&P 500 it held in 2010, illustrating the massive growth of the ETF industry.

 Halftime Report trader Joe Terranova, the chief market strategist for Virtus Investment Partners, which manages $25 billion, said, ""The danger is when the market falls. Liquidity will evaporate."" It's like having a building with four lines of people coming in through four entrances, but only one exit everyone will have to pile through in the case of an emergency.
Bank of America's note goes on to warn ETF fads ""can drive massive PE (price-earnings ratio) distortions."" The firm predicts the next big rush will be into ""[v]alue ETFs, environmental, social and corporate governance strategies and short-term quant strategies.""
The note also advises individual investors to seek out under-owned parts of the market, basically buying stocks before managers of ETFs gobble them up when it comes time to rebalance their funds.
The other side of the coin, however, is that ""there will always be a liquidity problem for the markets any time the amount of sellers swamps the amount of buyers,"" said Halftime Report trader and CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management Josh Brown.
""ETFs are way more efficient and although there will always be hiccups, the machinery has demonstrated its ability to be extremely durable in times of market stress,"" Brown said.
The Bank of America note points out that, like it or not, ETFs in the U.S. may still have a long way to go. The bank says almost 70 percent of all assets under management in Japan are passively managed ETFs — more than double the percent of assets in the U.S. Japan's central bank has added to that high percentage because it has also been buying ETFs as part of its plan to help Japan's economy.
Brown downplays overall fears of liquidity concerns here in the U.S., saying, ""It's just a fancy way of people complaining that they can't transact at the price they want to.""

 Apple's iPhone 8 may be delayed by 3 weeks or more, Bank of America says   
 12:23  PM ET Wed, 12 July 2017 |  00:46 
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch lowered its estimates for Apple's iPhone shipments by 11 million for the year, the latest Wall Street firm to expect launch delays.
 ""Our conversations with the Supply Chain suggest that the iPhone 8 will ship 3-4 weeks delayed given technological issues which Apple and its suppliers are working through,"" analysts Wamsi Mohan and Stefano Pascale said in a report Wednesday, citing a recent trip to Asia. The analysts maintained their buy rating on the stock.
The analysts said problems with finger print and 3-D sensors were to blame for the delay. Apple has not released a launch date for the smartphone but it typically releases the new iterations of the device in September. Mohan and Pascale believe that launch date could be delayed.
 Apple declined to comment.
The BofAML analysts cut their expectations for September quarter shipments of iPhones by 11 million and the December quarter by 6 million. For fiscal year 2017, the analysts expect 11 million fewer shipments for 2017, down to 208.1 million.
They also believe this delay and weaker-than-expected earnings from Apple on Aug. 1 may hurt the stock and gave clients an options trade to benefit from the coming sell-off.
The estimate cut comes a day after Fast Company reported that Apple is rushing to try to fix software bugs affecting the next iPhone and there's a ""sense of panic"" among the team. It cited a source familiar with the matter.
RBC Capital Markets, Cowen, KGI and Drexel Hamilton have said in the last few months the iPhone announcement could be delayed to October or November.
Shares of the iPhone maker traded mildly lower Wednesday. The stock has surged 26 percent this year. 
The BofAML analysts did raise their estimates for shipments in March 2018 by 10 million. They now expect iPhone shipments to rise to 243 million in 2018.

 Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Johnson and Johnson are among the companies reporting earnings early Tuesday.
 Netflix may also cast a glow on the market, after its stock jumped more than 10 percent in extended trading Monday after the company posted a surprisingly large increase in subscribers.
Besides earnings, there is also a batch of economic news, including import prices and business leaders survey, at 9:30 a.m. ET. The NAHB home builders survey is at 10 a.m., and Treasury capital flow data will be released at 4 p.m. ET.
 Earnings are the key focus for investors, however. Novartis, UnitedHealth, Lockheed Martin, Harley-Davison, TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab are also slated to report ahead of the opening bell. IBM, CSX, United Continental and Pinnacle Financial report after the closing bell.
""The market will be focusing on true economic metrics, meaning how are we doing, not how are we being supported. Rather than being enthused by lower interest rates, by the possibility of tax cuts, now we're being left to our own economic devices,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. ""Nobody's expecting the Fed to raise rates next Wednesday nor in September, and, I think based on recent commentary by the Federal Reserve members, now December is being called into question.""
It's early in the earnings season with just a few S&P companies reporting so far. About 65 are expected to report this week. Big banks kicked off reporting last week.
""You had weak sales in some of the financials, and they're struggling with that a little bit,"" said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold. 
Stocks were mixed Monday, but the Nasdaq gained nearly 2 points to 6,314, giving it a seven-day winning streak. The Dow was off 7 at 21,629 and the S&P 500 was down less than a point at 2459.

 The Bank of America Merrill Lynch's note was the most bullish on Netflix on Tuesday. On Monday, the streaming video company announced that 5.2 million subscribers had been added in the second quarter, 2 million more than analysts forecasted.
To hit the $300 per share mark, Netflix would need to post faster pricing growth of 7 percent per year versus its current models for 5 percent, while also rapidly increasing subscribers to 250 million internationally, the bank said.
""Pricing is a big driver as sub gains take more time to achieve offsetting valuation gains, but price changes are immediate rev. and margin lift,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Nat Schindler said in the note.
""We note that NFLX stated it expects ""mid-single digit ARPU growth for the foreseeable future"" and recently increased prices in Australia. We think further price increases in international markets could represent upside to our model and support our bull case scenario."" 
The note follows Netflix's Q2 earnings, which hit after the bell on Monday. 
Revenue came in at $2.79 billion versus $2.76 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. Netflix predicts revenue of $2.97 billion in the third quarter vs. $2.87 billion expected by Wall Street. Earnings per share in the second quarter were 15 cents, a penny short of expectations.

 Bank of America beats Street on top and bottom line   
 8:14  AM ET Tue, 18 July 2017 |  01:40 
 Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets under management, posted better-than-expected second-quarter results on Tuesday.
 The bank reported earnings per share of 46 cents on revenue of $22.829 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected earnings per share of 43 cents on sales of $21.781 billion.
However, the bank's stock fell 0.48 percent after reporting a slump in its trading business.
 Revenue from the company's fixed income trading unit totaled $2.254 billion for the quarter, topping expectations, but still represented a 14 percent year-over-year decline. The bank attributed the decline to ""weaker performance in rates and emerging markets relative to a strong year-ago quarter.""
Other major banks also reported a slowdown in second-quarter trading, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.
""The headline number is what looks to be a pretty solid beat. But as usual with these guys, [there are] a few moving parts. If you back out the net gains on the sale of the U.K. credit cards business and some securities gains and if you take out some reserve release, it gets me from the 46 [cents] reported number to a 43 [cents earnings per share],"" Jeffery Harte, principal at Sandler O'Neill, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
Bank of America said its global banking unit posted revenue of $5 billion, a record. Bank of America also reported net interest income of $11 billion, below a StreetAccount estimate of $11.34 billion.
Net charge-offs, a measure of costs for bad debt, decreased by 8 percent to $908 million, the bank said. Analysts polled by StreetAccount expected net charge-offs to total $975.3 million.
Here's a side-by-side comparison of Bank of America's results and Wall Street's estimates:
 EPS: 46 cents vs 43 cents expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $22.829 billion vs $21.781 billion expected by Reuters. Net interest income: $11 billion vs $11.34 billion expected by StreetAccount. Fixed income trading: $2.254 billion vs $2.22 billion expected. Net charge-offs: $908 million vs $975.3 million expected. 
The bank's stock has outperformed its peers over the past six months. In that time period, Bank of America shares have risen 6.14 percent. The SPDR S&P Bank exchange-traded fund (KBE), meanwhile, has gained 2.55 percent.

Late last month, the bank hiked its annual dividend to 48 cents a share, or 12 cents per quarter. The increase gave way for Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to become the bank's largest shareholder. Berkshire has warrants to buy 700 million common shares of Bank of America at $7.14 each.
Also last month, Bank of America started to lay off employees in its operations and technology division. The cuts came as the bank tries to reduce costs to boost financial targets set by CEO Brian Moynihan.
Bank of America is the latest big U.S. bank to report quarterly results. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all reported last week. Their results beat expectations. Goldman Sachs also reported quarterly results that beat expectations on Tuesday.

Anne Finucane, Bank of America vice chairman.
 Bank of America Vice Chairman Anne Finucane has been contacted by multiple people close to Uber's board of directors regarding the company's vacant CEO position, according to a report from Axios.
 Uber's former CEO, Travis Kalanick, resigned in June. 
Axios reports Finucane is ""said to be intrigued by the opportunity,"" but that no official talks with either the company or its executive search firm have been held. 
 The story lists three reasons why Finucane makes sense for Uber: her experience with crisis management, the company's preference for hiring a female CEO ""given its well-publicized issues with sexual harassment and gender discrimination,"" and Finucane's longtime Wall Street experience being important for the coming IPO plans.
Finucane is a member of Bank of America's $238 billion executive management committee and also leads its ESG, public policy, customer analytics and global marketing functions. She has been with the bank and its predecessor banks for about 22 years.

13,2017-07-21,Shrinking dollar will be 'toast' without tax reform—Bank of America strategist  ,"show chapters
 Trading the dollar decline   
 7:38  PM ET Fri, 21 July 2017 |  02:58 
 The dollar could continue to flounder and the economy could fall into recession unless Congress moves on tax-cutting legislation, said David Woo, head of global rates and foreign exchange strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 ""The single biggest driver of the dollar is the outlook for U.S. tax reform. If tax reform happens, it will be very bullish for the U.S. economy. It will allow the Fed to hike rates, and be extremely bullish for the dollar,"" he said.
Woo does see a strong chance for a tax bill. He said the recent weakness in the dollar has come as the Senate failed to pass a health-care package, which Republicans had hoped to approve ahead of tax reform. The outcome is still unclear for health care, but Wall Street remains convinced that Congress will try to push forward on tax reform.
 ""If tax reform doesn't happen, the economy will be slowing and we'll be in a recession within two years. The Fed will not be hiking rates and the dollar will be toast,"" he said.
Woo said Fed Chair Janet Yellen highlighted how important tax reform is when she told Congress earlier this month that fiscal uncertainty was one of the biggest risks facing the economy. Traders focused on her comments about inflation in that testimony, and the dollar has sold off since then.
The greenback has also taken a hit as traders bid up the euro on expectations the European Central Bank will announce this fall that it is reducing its quantitative easing program. The dollar this past week fell 1.8 percent against the euro zone currency, as the market responded to expectations of a hawkish ECB versus a possibly more dovish Fed. The euro is up nearly 11 percent against the dollar this year alone. 
""My view is until tax reform is resolved, one way or the other, the Fed is going to be sitting on its hands,"" said Woo. The strategist said that there is also uncertainty around the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. This week, reports that the scope of the investigation expanded to Trump's businesses weighed on the dollar.
""Obviously, the whole Mueller thing certainly that makes people think that tax reform is less likely to happen,"" said Woo.
""I'm still very, very optimistic on tax reform. I think there's a 90 percent chance tax reform gets done this year,"" he said. ""The only way tax reform gets done is the hard way, and the hard way would involve the president threatening to shut down the government and basically defaulting to get his party to vote on tax reform in September.""
Woo said President Donald Trump will only take that path if he believes he can get his way. ""He knows the Republican Party can afford this showdown much less than he can because he knows they could lose its majority in the House,"" he said.
The dollar could continue its downward trajectory, with euro-dollar heading to $1.20 from $1.1674 Friday. He said on the downside, the euro could go to $1.10.

14,2017-07-24,Major Wall Street analyst: Here’s what needs to happen for the bitcoin boom to keep going  ,"Yuriko Nakao | Bloomberg | Getty Images
 Bitcoin still faces many challenges in becoming a globally accepted currency, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's commodity and derivatives strategist Francisco Blanch said in a sweeping Monday report comparing digital currencies' growth to that of gold, silver and even salt in ancient times.
 ""A crucial hurdle"" for bitcoin is whether major financial institutions will accept the digital currency as collateral, said Blanch, who is considered by many to be one of the best commodity analysts on Wall Street. ""But we are not aware of any major institution that takes cryptocurrency as collateral at the moment.""
The report is one of a handful from major Wall Street firms and strategists that have recently warmed to bitcoin for its potential as an investment product. The digital currency briefly tripled in value this year, rising from below $1,000 to $3,000 in June. Bitcoin traded near $2,800 Monday.
 Beginning with salt in ancient times, Blanch noted how practical needs and new discoveries have led to the development of new currencies:
 1. Salt was ""once mined and treasured in the ancient world."" 2. But salt and other commodity-backed currencies often proved impractical and not durable enough, so governments began making coins with metals such as gold and copper. 3. The Spanish discovered large silver deposits in Bolivia in the 16th-century, leading to nearly 400 years of trade dominated by silver dollars.  4. Carrying around large amounts of gold and silver wasn't ideal either, so the world started to move to paper money in the last 200 years.  5. Paper money created huge waves of price increases and declines along with the business cycle. Today, most countries' currencies rely on ""full faith of the issuing government"" that central banks will comply with their mandate not to let inflation run too high or low.  
Given this history of currency development, BofAML's Blanch seems to hint that bitcoin may soon be considered legitimate. He laid out three main criteria that bitcoin must meet in order to become a reserve currency of the world: safety, liquidity and return.
""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies score well on some, and not so well on others,"" Blanch said.
 Safety
 Bitcoin didn't score that well on this parameter, Blanch said. ""The lack of a centralized decision-making process or authority creates risks such as a currency split,"" he said. ""Also, risks such ashacking, identity theft, or outright scams are a recurring problem.""
However, when using volatility to measure the safety of bitcoin, the cryptocurrency has actually beat silver.
""Bitcoin's volatility is very high compared to the euro, the yen or even gold,"" Blanch said. ""But it fell twice last year below the volatility of silver, the world's currency for 400 years.""

 Liquidity
 Market liquidity as reflected by the amount of trading is still far greater in stocks, fixed income and traditional currencies, Blanch said.
But ""it is hard to ignore that trading volumes for major digital currencies like bitcoin and Ethereum have skyrocketed in recent years,"" he said, noting that since 2012, daily trading volumes for bitcoin have grown five times to $2 billion a day.
 Return
 The recent interest in bitcoin and other digital currencies has sent their prices soaring. The market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has leaped from around $20 billion at the start of this year to around $90 billion.
Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year, while rival digital currency Ethereum has skyrocketed several thousand percent.
However, Blanch, like others, noted that the gains in bitcoin's price are due partly to the increasing difficulty of mining, or generating, new bitcoins. ""This could change with the advent of quantum computers or through agreements among developers to adopt simpler protocols.""
 A 'pattern similar to gold'
 Amid the emergence of new currencies, gold has long been a benchmark for international measures of value. The precious metal backed the U.S. dollar for decades, marking a peg for global currencies. But in 1971, President Richard Nixon suspended the ability for the dollar to be converted into the precious metal. 
Cryptocurrencies arose during the financial crisis and have demonstrated ""a few advantages"" over major world currencies, such as the ability to cheaply and instantaneously transfer money around the world, and record all transactions through a digital accounting system known as a blockchain, Blanch said. 
In expectation of this potential, many have called bitcoin ""digital gold"" despite the lack of businesses that accept bitcoin and the often high transaction fees. 
Gold itself has stagnated in the last several years. The precious metal leaped from several hundred dollars in the early 2000s to near $2,000 in 2011, and has traded between $1,000 and $1,400 in the last two years.
Fundstrat's Tom Lee said in a report on bitcoin in early July that buyers' shift from gold into cryptocurrencies is a reason why the digital currency's price could rise into the tens of thousands.
Due to higher bitcoin mining costs and a surge of interest, the digital currency's price has climbed in ""a pattern similar to gold"" and ""over a much more compressed time period,"" Blanch said.
Bitcoin (years in parentheses) vs. gold

 To be sure, short-term appearances of similarities among bitcoin, gold and the development of historical currencies don't imply that bitcoin is here to stay.
""There is no certainty that that [similarity to gold] will continue and, most certainly, no way to predict it,"" Blanch said. ""In our view, cryptocurrency returns will mostly depend on the faith placed by individuals, corporations, and financial institutions on this emerging technology.""

 More zombie companies in Europe than US: BoAML   
 10:11  AM ET Thu, 27 July 2017 |  03:59 
 The European Central Bank (ECB) needs to beware of raising interest rates too quickly as there are a significant number of ""zombie firms"" in Europe that have become too dependent on cheap credit, according to analysis by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 Barnaby Martin, head of European Credit Strategy at BofA Merrill Lynch, said businesses in Europe which have benefited from the ECB's corporate bond purchase program would struggle once the bank raises interest rates, expected sometime in 2018.
""The worst kept secret in the market is (ECB President) Mario Draghi is going to be tapering monetary policy next year and yet last week he was super, super dovish so I think that we've forgotten that monetary policy in Europe is on its way out,"" he told CNBC on Tuesday, adding ""there's clearly political pressure for him to move away from this extraordinary era.""
 ""So the question becomes 'can we handle a rapid rise in interest rates?',"" he said.
ECB stimulus measures as part of its quantitative easing program designed to boost the European economy currently amount to 60 billion euros ($69.9 billion) a month. Some of this money goes into purchasing corporate bonds.
 Has the ECB helped troubled companies?

 While these purchases have enabled companies to continue to operate and invest, aiding a recovery in the European economy, the bank's purchases have been credited for keeping ailing companies alive, hence the name ""zombies.""
The ECB started purchasing corporate bonds in June 2016 as part of its ""corporate sector purchase program"" (CSPP) and, as of June 7, 2017, its CSPP holdings stood at 92 billion euros, the bank said.
In a note examining ""The rise of the Zombies"" BofA Merrill Lynch's credit strategists Martin, Ionnis Angelakis and Souhair Asba noted that 9 percent of non-financial companies in Europe (by market cap of Stoxx 600) are zombies, with ""very weak interest coverage metrics.""

 ""Note that this is still quite a high number: It was around 6 percent pre-Lehman, and fell to 5 percent in late 2013 after the peripheral crisis had faded,"" they said.
""The plethora of monetary support in Europe over the last 5 years has allowed companies with weak profitability to continue to refinance their debt and stave off defaults."" The analyst team also noted that bond issuance had been concentrated in ""the hands of a few.""
""Year-to-date, the top 20 bonds issuers have accounted for 40 percent of supply. In 2015 and 2016, the number was closer to 25 percent. The result has been that ""superfirms"" have been quietly building across the credit market,"" they noted.
 Would companies suffer under higher interest rates?
 ""(While) corporate leverage is down, if you look at it from a different way, interest coverage – and that's where the whole zombie phenomena comes from -- you find in Europe that there is this whole group of companies that would struggle under much higher interest rates,"" Martin told CNBC.
""(The number of zombie companies is) higher than it was pre-Lehman (Brothers), it's higher than it was in mid to late-2013 after the Greek saga, there is this area of financial vulnerability in Europe.""
Smaller firms, mainly in peripheral European countries and particularly in utility and energy sector, are most vulnerable to higher interest rates, Martin said, adding that he hoped the ECB would take note and be ""super patient"" in the timing of its tapering program.
""We think this should motivate the ECB to reduce QE in a slow and patient manner and hold-off on substantial rate hikes in the near-term (as our economists have been insisting). Allowing a (German) bund shock and a credit tantrum to take hold would only pressure corporate interest costs again, and risk a rise of the zombies,"" BofA's strategists warned.

 BofA: Here's why the dollar is oversold   
 1:07  PM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 |  03:18 
 The U.S. dollar index is hovering near its lowest level in more than a year, and according to one strategist we may have just witnessed a bottom.
 Paul Ciana, chief global technical strategist at Bank of America, says there are two charts of the dollar that show how grossly oversold it is.
On CNBC's ""Futures Now"" Tuesday, Ciana looked at a weekly chart of the U.S. dollar index and noted that its latest declines actually haven't had too much brawn behind them. The strategist is looking at the relative strength index, or RSI, of the U.S. dollar, which tracks the momentum of the dollar's moves. The RSI has reached its lowest level in years, according to Ciana's chart, meaning that the latest drop in the dollar didn't have as much momentum to the downside. This leads the strategist to believe that ""it could be wise to think about a little bit of a dollar long.""
 But in addition to the RSI reading, Ciana also points out that ""dollar breadth measures show bearish momentum and oversold conditions"" unseen since around 2012.
""As it stands today, there are only two dollar crosses that are above their 200-day moving average,"" said Ciana. ""The magnitude of those downtrends is massive. With that, as of [Monday], 11 of 30 dollar crosses were oversold.""
 For investors looking to play the dollar to the longside, Ciana advocates a more ""seasonal"" approach. According to Ciana, seasonal data shows that in the month of August, the U.S. dollar has actually held strong against nine emerging market currencies, especially the Mexican peso. In other words, not only should investors be long the U.S. dollar, but they may also possibly want to short the peso.
The dollar bounced off its 13-month lows on Wednesday, ahead of the Fed's decision.

 Mutual funds are piling into technology stocks to a record level, according to a latest active managers holdings report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 But the overweighting may not be bullish for the sector going forward.In July ""large cap active managers have yet again increased their positioning in tech, setting another record overweight of 25% (+5.8 percentage points) relative to the benchmark,"" strategist Savita Subramanian wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""This record overweight has helped managers beat their benchmarks so far this year, as tech continues to outperform all other sectors."" Subramanian's team aggregated all the positions from U.S. large-cap equity mutual funds, using FactSet institutional ownership data. They then compared the weightings versus the relevant equity index benchmark to calculate the rankings. After analyzing the performance data, the team found investor positioning in stocks inversely correlates to future returns. ""Over the last several years, buying the most underweight stocks and selling the most overweight stocks has consistently generated alpha,"" she wrote.
Alpha is defined as the excess return of a portfolio relative to a market benchmark's performance. Subramanian has said it's more difficult for crowded stocks to move higher since everyone is already in the trade. Moreover, when sentiment shifts there may be more downside risk as investors flee for the exits at once. As a result, investors may want to avoid the most overweight and crowded stocks in any given sector. Here are the top 10 most overweight technology stocks, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

 Technology stocks remain the most popular place to be for active managers according to a new Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey released Tuesday, but there are still some names in the hot sector that are 'under-owned' by investors.
 The stocks that are most loved by active managers in the space include Alphabet's Class A shares, which are held by 58 percent of the funds in the survey. Facebook is held by 53 percent of the funds, Visa, by 52 percent of the funds and Mastercard, held by 38 percent. Texas Instruments, and Salesforce also ranked among the most popular stocks held by fund managers in the technology sector.
The Nasdaq 100 is up 21 percent so far in 2017, far outpacing the Dow which is up eleven percent and the S&P 500 which is up ten point five percent year to date.
 If you're looking for under-crowded trades in the tech sector, IBM is owned by only 20 percent of funds investing in the tech space. That stock is down 12.5 percent so far in 2017.
Also on the list of stocks that are under-owned by funds in the tech sector; Seagate Technology which is down 12 percent this year after seeing a big run up in the first quarter of the year. Akamai made the list as well, it is down 29 percent this year. FLIR Systems is up just two percent this year. Advanced Micro Devices is also on the under-owned list, but it's one case where fund managers missed out, it's up 21 percent year to date.
A big surprise in this month's survey is that Bank of America Merrill Lynch sees pick up in the real estate sector.

 AMD to surge more than 40% because its new chip will take share from Intel: Analyst   
 3:24  PM ET Tue, 15 Aug 2017 |  00:44 
 Cryptocurrency mining demand for AMD's graphics cards may be all the rage, but a top Wall Street firm says investors shouldn't overlook its improving processor chip business.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating for the chipmaker's shares, saying the company's recently launched Ryzen processors are selling well against Intel.""Our industry checks show improving mindshare/shelf-space for AMD's new Ryzen desktop-PC processors, incl. 30-50% share at prominent e-tailors, well ahead of AMD's 11% current desktop unit share,"" analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""The key conclusion is that AMD has momentum which should gradually translate to share gains.""AMD launched its Ryzen line of processors on March 2. Arya reaffirmed his $18 price target for the company, representing 41 percent upside from Monday's close. The analyst cited how AMD's Ryzen chips typically have twice the number of processor cores in similar price ranges compared to Intel's products, which ""translates to better multi-tasking/productivity"" performance.""AMD is getting broader OEM [PC original equipment manufacturer] placement which should help accelerate sales in the second half,"" he wrote.Arya is also optimistic over AMD's newly launched Vega gaming graphics cards. Early reviews on the Vega cards ""are mostly positive and demand appears to be strong as popular online retail site NewEgg sold out of its initial allotment within 15 minutes,"" the analyst wrote. AMD shares rose 1 percent on midday Tuesday after the report. The company's shares are one of the market's best-performing equities in the past year with the stock up nearly 85 percent in the past 12 months through midday Tuesday compared with the S&P 500's 12.5 percent return. That performance ranks No. 4 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.

23,2017-08-16,Former Bank of America IT guy allegedly shared deal tips from bank's computer system  ,"Jim Bourg | Reuters
The Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington.
 A former Bank of America technology consultant used his access to the bank's internal deal tracking system to share more than 50 trading tips with friends, who generated more than $5 million in illegal trading profits, federal prosecutors said.
 The worker, Daniel Rivas, ""serially misappropriated material, non-public information from the bank's deal tracking system and passed it along to friends so they could utilize it to make profitable trades,"" according to an indictment unsealed Wednesday by the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York.
Prosecutors laid out 54 insider trading charges against five of Rivas' acquaintances in the indictment. Rivas pleaded guilty on Aug. 9. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced its own insider trading charges against Rivas, and six other individuals on Wednesday.
 The trades were in more than two dozen securities, including AstraZeneca, St. Jude Medical, Monsanto, Cabela's, Diamond Resorts International, Panera Bread, Macy's and LifeLock, the indictment said.
""We fired Mr. Rivas in April and cooperated fully with the government's investigation into this matter,"" Bank of America said in a statement to CNBC.
Rivas went on to work at RBC and has since been suspended pending further review, according to a statement from the bank. 
An attorney for Rivas did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.
Rivas worked at Bank of America for about four years, and he had access to the firm's system containing ""material, non-public information about potential and unannounced merger and acquisition transactions,"" the U.S. indictment said.
He shared trading tips with his girlfriend's father, James Moodhe, and with two separate groups of friends. Moodhe also allegedly shared the inside information with Michael Siva, a financial advisor at a brokerage firm, who traded for himself and clients based on the trading tips. Moodhe was named in the SEC charges. Silva was named in both the federal indictment and the SEC case.
Moodhe and Siva tried to cover up their tracks by making it appear that Siva directed the trades, the indictment said. 
One of their most profitable illegal trades was around AstraZeneca's Nov. 2015 tender offer acquisition of ZS Pharma. Moodhe and Siva together purchased nearly 30,000 shares, sold out after the news was made public, and took in nearly $600,000 in illegal gains, the indictment said. 
In total, Siva and Moodhe generated profits of more than $3 million, according to the indictment, and Siva also earned thousands of dollars in commissions on illegal trades entered on behalf of his clients. 
Rivas also allegedly shared insider information with friends Roberto Rodriguez and Rodolfo Sablon, who planned to set up an investment fund trading on the tips. They were both named in the indictment and the SEC case.
Two others charged in both cases were Jhonatan Zoquier, a union representative, and Jeffrey Rogiers, a computer and network security analyst who received tips. 
The individuals also allegedly shared the information with other people, who also made profitable trades, the indictment said.

Lululemon is ""gaining share from saturated competitors.

""Nike and Under Armour have suffered from a lack of innovation, over-distribution in moderate channels, and heavy promotions."" Lululemon has underperformed the market this year with its shares down 10.6 percent through Friday, compared with the S&P 500's 8.3 percent return. The analyst raised his price target for Lululemon to $70 from $49, representing 20 percent upside from Friday's close. Jadrosich said Lululemon's recent products such as the Enlite bra, Nulux fabric and Wunder Under technology will drive sales growth in the future.""Lululemon's fabric and product innovation appears robust, in our view,"" he wrote. ""We believe lulu will increase its assortment of Jacquard (specialized knitted and dyed nylon yarn that allows designers to form unique textured patterns), which will carry higher average selling prices and is difficult to replicate."" As a result, the analyst predicts the company's same-store sale growth will increase to 5 percent in the July quarter from the negative 1 percent in the April quarter. Shares of Lululemon rose 1 percent Monday morning after the upgrade.

 Investors pull billions from US stocks in longest outflow streak since 2004   
 4:12  PM ET Fri, 25 Aug 2017 |  00:47 
 Investors are fleeing U.S. stocks in a way they haven't since 2004.
 For 10 straight weeks a total of $30 billion has left U.S. stocks, marking the longest streak of outflows since 2004, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a Thursday report, citing EPFR Global data. 
Investors turned instead to emerging markets and European and Japanese stocks, which saw $36 billion in inflows over the last 10 weeks, the report said.

BofAML's breakdown of last week's fund flows pointed to more aversion to risk among investors, and could add to some analysts' worries about deteriorating market internals.
The 10-week outflow from U.S. stocks comes despite the S&P 500's nearly 1 percent gain this quarter and a record high on Aug. 8.

 US stock funds seeing longest run of outflows   
 2:09  PM ET Fri, 25 Aug 2017 |  01:43 
 The report also pointed out the turn away from U.S. stocks coincided with the late June surge in the euro against the U.S. dollar to its strongest in nearly a year, after comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi suggested higher inflation and tighter monetary policy soon in the euro zone. 
The euro subsequently climbed to its highest in more than two years in early August, and traded slightly below those levels near $1.186 Friday. Draghi is scheduled to speak later Friday afternoon at an annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. 
In the week ended Wednesday, European stocks saw their first outflows in seven weeks, the BofAML report said, while Japanese stocks saw their largest inflow in five months at $3.1 billion.

 Major contributors to U.S. stock market gains in the last several months saw significant outflows in the week ended Wednesday, the BofAML report said: 
 Technology — $600 million, largest in 49 weeks. Financials — $35 million, second straight week. Consumer — $1.5 billion, third largest ever 
The defensive utilities sector was the only U.S. stock sector to see slight inflows in the last week. 
By investing style, investors withdrew $1.6 billion from U.S. growth stock funds and $1.1 billion from U.S. value stock funds, the BofAML report said. Only U.S. small caps saw inflows, at $700 million.
Investors also piled into Treasury bonds, which saw their greatest inflows in 10 weeks at $900 billion. But riskier high-yield debt posted $2.2 billion in outflows, its eighth week out of 10 of withdrawals, the report said. 
That said, analysts don't expect the defensive turn to result in a large market downturn. 
""This is definitely weaker U.S. equity inflows but still net positive and my sense is that positioning is still long and the VIX back at 11 shows there is still complacency,"" Ilya Feygin, managing director and senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital, said Friday. He estimated U.S. stock exchange-traded funds, passive investment products which have risen in popularity over mutual funds, gained $6.1 billion in net inflows since June 30.
In addition, BofAML said its proprietary Bull & Bear indicator did not trigger a ""sell"" signal, meaning the market still remains in a rally mode. 
And while overall the bank's wealthy private clients turned more defensive, their allocation to one traditional safe haven, precious metals ETFs, has fallen to record lows, BofAML said.

 2:53  PM ET Tue, 29 Aug 2017 |  00:51 
 Analyzing the large amounts of data created by internet-connected devices will be a huge market in the coming decades, according to a top Wall Street firm.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch says the artificial intelligence and so-called big data analysis trends will also have dramatic ramifications for business and markets.
""We are living in an exponential age where ubiquitous connectivity and decreasing cost are leading to the digitization and datafication of most activities,"" equity strategist Beijia Ma wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
 Big data, which refers to computers analyzing large amounts of information for patterns and associations, and artificial intelligence are as critical to this trend as the internet and smartphones, she added, and ""set to propel the 5th wave of IT-driven productivity growth.""
Ma estimates the big data market is set to reach $210 billion by 2020, and ""AI will be the single largest driver of tech spend over the next decade.""
Some 90 percent of the world's data was created in the last two years, Ma said. This will only accelerate, and she predicts internet-connected devices will double in number every two to three years, rising to 1 trillion by 2035.
The strategist said the ""untapped potential is huge"" for big data and AI computing as only 0.5 percent to 1 percent of data generated so far has been analyzed.
To take advantage of the trend, here are seven buy-rated companies that Bank of America Merrill Lynch recommended.

Lowe's stock closed Friday at $74.65 a share, down about 3 percent over the past 12 months. For 2017, though, shares have rallied roughly 5 percent as of Friday's close. The stock was up 1.1 percent Tuesday morning.
""We believe increasing housing market momentum and big ticket spending will provide support to LOW longer term, particularly as it begins to see benefit from its restructuring initiatives over time,"" Bank of America analyst Elizabeth Suzuki wrote in a Tuesday note to clients.
 ""We believe LOW's profitability will also continue to improve and its comp gap with HD will continue to narrow as product differentiation and resets help drive comps.""
As retail goes, Lowe's and its larger rival Home Depot paint a better picture than other companies struggling to post positive same-store sales.
In their latest quarters, Lowe's same-store sales climbed 4.5 percent, while Home Depot reported growth of 6.3 percent for the closely watched retail metric. Both easily topped Wall Street expectations.
Suzuki has called Lowe's the ""cheaper but riskier name in home improvement."" There is still room for it to grow in Mexico and Canada, she added.
Bank of America still calls Home Depot ""the leader"" in home improvement retail.
In a separate note Tuesday morning, Suzuki and her firm reinstated coverage on the retailer, assigning it a buy rating and a price target of $170 per share. Home Depot's stock closed Friday at $150.78 per share, having risen 12 percent over the past 12 months. It was up nearly 1 percent in Tuesday's session.
""The macro backdrop for growth in home improvement spending is favorable, and HD is also well positioned to continue its solid track record of share gains,"" Suzuki said.
One particular bright spot has been Home Depot's increased investments in so-called smart home products, she said. Sales of these products are actually growing faster than Home Depot's company average.
""In order to compete with Amazon and brick-and-mortar retailers with exclusive smart-home products, HD will need to establish a dominant market position as the expert in home automation, which requires investment in sourcing initiatives, employee education, and marketing,"" Suzuki said.
On the whole, the story for home improvement retailers remains much more positive than that of other consumer-facing companies. Old houses tend to need investment, and millennials are seeking out pros for project assistance. Meanwhile, a favorable housing cycle is benefiting everyone, according to Bank of America.
One fear that continues to haunt some investors, though, is the idea of Amazon wrecking havoc on the space. The internet giant boasts big-name brands like Black + Decker, Honeywell and Kohler on its own home improvement site.
On the days Home Depot and Lowe's reported second-quarter earnings, their shares fell despite upbeat results.
""HD is hitting on all cylinders, yet shares are weak, which may reflect further concerns about future online competition. ..."" Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder wrote in a note to clients last month.

33,2017-09-11,Report: Women expect to catch up to (or pass) the number of men holding executive roles  ,"Women business owners think their future is looking brighter.
 Despite bleak headlines earlier this year around gender issues at companies like Uber and Google, women entrepreneurs reported an optimistic outlook for the next 20 years, according to the 2017 Bank of America Women Business Owner Spotlight study.
The survey revealed that they have high expectations for improvement in areas like business ownership, leadership and equal pay for women.
 For example, at the start of 2017, 32 Fortune 500 companies had women as CEOs, or 6.4 percent of the list. (That number has fallen since Marissa Mayer stepped down as CEO of Yahoo, and Mondelēz CEO Irene Rosenfeld plans to step down in November.)
But women business owners see change coming: 68 percent say they believe women will catch up to, or surpass, the number of men who hold roles as corporate executives and leaders in the next two decades.

 });
 Though past research has shown that women make roughly 83 percent of what men earn, more than half (61 percent) of women entrepreneurs surveyed think wages for women will match or exceed the income for their male counterparts by 2037.
Forty percent of new entrepreneurs in the U.S. are women, according to the 2017 Kauffman Index of Startup Activity. A recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey of 2,030 small-business owners also found that 40 percent were women. But 66 percent of women business owners surveyed for the Women Business Owner Spotlight think women will own more small businesses than men in the next 20 years.
The women surveyed were also optimistic when it comes to paid maternity leave — 71 percent expect to see at least 25 states enact a policy by 2037.
And, 80 percent say they anticipate ""equal or greater representation of women in STEM fields compared to men,"" over the next two decades, according to the study. STEM stands for science, technology, engineering and math, and is often pointed to as some of the most lucrative subjects to study in school.
The survey contacted 1,022 U.S. small business owners with annual revenue between $100,000 and $4,999,999. Of that group, 375 of the business owners were women.

 Nvidia hits another all-time high   
 11:37  AM ET Mon, 18 Sept 2017 |  00:40 
 Nvidia shares are surging as Wall Street is growing more bullish on the company's artificial intelligence opportunity. 
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its price target for the chipmaker to the second highest among analyst firms, citing the company's product leadership in the gaming, data center and AI markets.
The move came two days after Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse raised his price target to a Street-high price target on a similar thesis.
 ""Our positive view on Nvidia is based on its underappreciated transformation from a traditional PC graphics chip vendor, into a supplier into high end gaming, enterprise graphics, cloud, accelerated computing and automotive markets,"" analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients Sunday.
""Similar to other large successful tech industries, we expect the $30bn AI chip market to also feature one dominant supplier – we think NVDA.""
Nvidia shares opened up 3 percent on Monday. The stock reached an all-time high on Friday, closing at $180.11.
Arya reiterated his buy and ""top pick"" ratings for Nvidia shares. He raised his price target for the stock to $210 from $185, representing 17 percent upside from Friday's close. He now has the second highest price target on the stock out of more than 30 analysts, according to FactSet. Evercore's Muse is the highest with a $250 12-month forecast.
Bank of America predicts data center capital spending will rise 21 percent in 2018 from an estimated 16.5 percent in 2017. Arya also said Google's AI product is a specialized chip compared with Nvidia's more general purpose processor, which is easier to program for different tasks.
""Incumbency matters and Nvidia has a much wider AI/machine learning ecosystem that will be tough to match,"" he wrote.
Nvidia's stock is up 187 percent in the past 12 months through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 17 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
""Separately we note NVDA's first mover advantage and growing influence in the multi trillion $ healthcare industry where AI/deep learning is being used for predictive analytics, image scanning and pathology assessments,"" the analyst wrote. ""Indeed about 50% of submitted papers at last week's Medical Imaging Computing conference (MICCAI) were on deep learning.""

 Fed hike around the corner?   
 5:01  PM ET Fri, 15 Sept 2017 |  03:40 
 The chances of an interest rate hike announcement in December have increased in recent days, according to a new Bank of America report published ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting this Wednesday.
 ""Interestingly, market expectations for December have climbed higher over the past few days, pricing in nearly even odds of a move in December,"" strategists and economists, led by chief U.S. economist Michelle Meyer, wrote in a Friday report.
 In the report, titled ""Like Watching Paint Dry,"" the strategists pointed out that the overnight index swap market is pricing in a roughly 45 percent chance of a hike in December, up from just 20 percent toward the end of the week ending Sept. 8. The report's authors anticipate the next hike will come in December, with three more hikes next year. This increase in expectations comes on the heels of firming inflation figures.
Echoing a similar sentiment, Goldman Sachs economists said last week that the chances of a third rate hike this year have risen to 60 percent, from 55 percent, after the Consumer Price Index rose considerably in August.
As measures of inflation in the U.S. had again and again missed economists' expectations this year, the likelihood of further rate hikes has been called into question.
Though some have pointed to this firming in Consumer Price Index, the personal consumption expenditures is still well below the central bank's target, said Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global. Indeed, the most recent PCE reading reflected its smallest year-over-year increase since December 2015. This gives Sanchez pause about the likelihood of a rate hike coming in December.
Some are more sanguine when it comes to the market impact of a potential rate hike.
""It really is interesting because not too long ago, the fed funds [futures] were saying no December rate hike, and now it looks like there's a good chance,"" Eddy Elfenbein, portfolio manager at AdvisorShares, said Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" 
""I think it would be a big mistake if the Fed were to move too soon,"" Elfenbein said. ""But the good news is, there's still a lot of room. I don't think they would do a lot of damage, yet, to the economy or to the stock market at this point.""
At this week's meeting, Bank of America strategists and economists expect (in line with the general consensus) that the Federal Open Market Committee will address its multitrillion-dollar balance sheet normalization, an announcement the report said will likely have little to no market impact given the advance notice.
Instead, the main focus will be economic forecasts and the so-called ""dot plot,"" referring to FOMC officials' views on the fed funds rate.

The analyst gave his five key reasons why e-commerce will continue to gain retail market share:
 ""Consumer acceptance of eCommerce in more categories (apparel, grocery)."" ""Improving convenience for the shopper, including better selection."" ""Faster and more reliable delivery."" ""Use of big data and improving shopping experiences."" ""Offline retailer focus and new business models targeting under-penetrated segments.""

 General Motors' strong competitive position in key future technologies in the auto market is underestimated by investors, according to a Wall Street firm.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its rating for GM to buy from neutral, saying the company will thrive due to its upcoming electric and autonomous cars.
""GM's management is proactively pursuing expansion opportunities at an acceleratingpace, while maintaining the strength of its core truck and global auto business,"" analyst John Murphy wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We believe GM has many pieces of the puzzle (and more pieces than its major competitors) that will be required to deploy and monetize future vehicle technology, namely electrification, autonomy, and connectivity.""
 GM shares jumped 2 percent to a record Tuesday after the call and are now up 24 percent for the year, compared with the S&P 500's 13 percent return. Murphy raised his price target for GM's stock to $57 from $40, representing 35 percent upside from Monday's close.
""We think GM's ability to integrate an autonomous electric vehicle into a ride hailing fleetand/or shared fleet, with the overlay of OnStar, puts the company in a uniquecompetitive first mover position,"" he wrote.

 Bank of America: Apple shares to soar on Trump tax reform   
 11:01  AM ET Mon,  9 Oct 2017 |  00:37 
 Apple will be a big beneficiary of President Donald Trump's tax reform plan, according to a top Wall Street firm.
 The Trump and Republican Congress tax reform plan calls for a corporate tax rate reduction to 20 percent from 35 percent and a lower repatriation tax rate for U.S. companies' accumulated foreign earnings.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating on Apple shares, saying the company's earnings would surge under the plan.
 ""We look at two aspects of potential tax law reform and their implications on Apple. … We conclude that: existing deferred tax liability on the balance sheet could allow for substantially all of Apple's foreign cash to be repatriated to the U.S.,"" analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients Monday.
""Importantly given the access to the [repatriated] cash, investors will likely assign a higher multiple to shares of Apple.""
Apple shares are up 0.4 percent during Monday's premarket session.
Mohan reaffirmed his $180 price target for Apple shares, representing 16 percent upside to Friday's close.
The analyst said if Congress lowers the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and interest expense becomes nontax deductible, Apple earnings per share will benefit by 77 cents in fiscal 2018 and by 89 cents in fiscal 2019.
In addition, Mohan said the company has $223 billion of ""unrestricted"" cash held overseas that could be brought back to the U.S. under the plan's lower repatriation tax rate. He assumes a repatriation tax rate of 8.75 percent versus the current 35 percent rate for his analysis.
Mohan also shares what he believes Apple could do with the newly repatriated cash:
 1) ""Increase the rate of buybacks and dividend increases: More domestic cash could help Apple buy back more stock or further raise its dividend."" 2) ""Invest more in R&D: Apple could use the repatriated cash to invest more in R&D within the U.S."" He also said Capex plans could change based on any new expensing rules. 3) ""Invest more in M&A: Apple could use the cash to fund more acquisitions of companies within the U.S."" 4) ""Pay down debt: If interest expense is no longer tax deductible in the U.S., it may be in Apple's interest to pay down any U.S. domestic debt sooner."" 
Despite some recent volatility, Apple' stock is significantly outperforming the market. Its shares are up 34 percent year to date through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 14 return.

 Bank of America earnings beat forecasts, shares rise   
 7:26  AM ET Fri, 13 Oct 2017 |  01:52 
 Bank of America reported third-quarter results on Friday that beat Wall Street expectations despite a slowdown in its fixed-income trading business.
 Here's how the company's results fared against Wall Street expectations:
 EPS: 48 cents vs 45 cents forecast by Thomson Reuters Revenue: $22.079 billion vs $21.976 billion 
 The company's stock closed 1.5 percent higher.
""I think this was a fairly strong quarter for Bank of America here,"" said Stephen Biggar, director of financial institutions research at Argus Research, on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""Loans were up 6 percent, not quite as high as [JPMorgan] reported yesterday, but margins did improve year over year, which is a very good sign.""
""Of course the one glaring weak spot was trading revenues,"" Biggar said.
 Scott Mlyn | CNBC 
A Bank of America branch in New York.
 The bank also said, however, its fixed-income trading revenue fell 22 percent on a year-over-year basis. Third-quarter fixed-income revenue totaled $2.152 billion versus $2.646 billion in the year-earlier period. Bank of America said the slowdown was ""driven by less favorable market conditions across credit-related products, as well as lower volatility in rates products.""
""This slowly grinding higher market is great for the asset-management businesses, but not so great for trading results,"" Argus Research's Biggar said.
JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup also reported sharp declines in quarterly fixed-income trading on Thursday.
Net interest income, a key metric for banks, totaled $11.4 billion, more than the $11.33 billion expected by StreetAccount and about the year-earlier period total of $10.429 billion.
Net charge-offs, a measure of costs for bad debt, increased by $12 million on a year-over-year basis to $900 million, driven by higher commercial losses, the bank said.
Loans, meanwhile, totaled $927.1 Billion for the period, more than the expected $919.94 billion. Deposits also topped consensus, coming in at $1.284 trillion. Analysts polled by StreetAccount expected deposits to total $1.273 trillion.
""Our focus on responsible growth and improving the way we serve customers and clients produced another quarter of strong results. Revenue across our four lines of business grew 4 percent, even with a challenging comparable quarter for trading,"" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said in a statement.
Bank of America's consumer banking business saw revenue rise 10 percent to $8.8 billion, with loans rising 8 percent and deposits 9 percent.
Shares of Bank of America have risen nearly 16 percent this year, slightly outperforming the S&P 500 index.
 Analysts at Credit Suisse think the stock, along with that of other banking giants, could benefit from potential tax cuts and ""progress on regulatory reform.""
""We'll continue to assess valuations cognizant of the economic cycle, but equally as willing to embrace the changing operating environment, inclusive of the improved prospects for regulatory reform,""  analyst Susan Roth Katzke said in a note to clients.
Last week, the Treasury Department released a white paper in which it recommends easing banking regulations.
Wells Fargo also reported earnings before the opening bell.

 Market 'euphoria' may indicate bull market nearing end: BofA's Savita Subramanian   
 2:05  PM ET Tue, 17 Oct 2017 |  04:01 
 As investors get more confident about the latest leg of the stock market rally, one Wall Street strategist is growing more concerned.
 ""This is kind of how bull markets end,"" Savita Subramanian, equity and quant strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told CNBC during an interview Tuesday. ""What we're in right now is this sort of euphoria around stocks that's been missing for this entire bull market.""
Indeed, the run that began in March 2009 often has been declared ""the most hated bull market in history,"" due largely to the lack of investor participation. 
 However, Subramanian said she feels the tone is shifting. Wall Street pros like her are moving more money to equities, companies are starting to pull back on share repurchases as stocks get more expensive, and investors are demanding more from companies when they report earnings.
""People are starting to buy the dream that stocks can go up,"" she said. ""This is what I worry about. It's not the age of the bull market, cause bull markets don't die of old age. It's just a lot of the things we're looking at look very late-cycle.""
One of the main things Subramanian pointed to was investor reaction to quarterly earnings reports.
 Kai Pfaffenbach | Reuters
 Heading into this week, 81 percent of S&P 500 companies had beaten profit expectations, after 73 percent had done so in the second quarter. In both quarters, investors have had muted reactions to earnings beats. Where shares of those outperforming companies would be expected to rise, they have had almost no reaction.
In fact, companies that beat earnings in the second quarter actually averaged a slight decline in the two days after reporting.
""There has been no reward for earnings beats, which is a little bit weird,"" Subramanian said. ""The bar's getting higher. Investors are expecting good news. When they got good news, it's already in the stocks.""
Investor behavior and sentiment have shown additional signs of optimism.
Cash balances for fund managers have fallen to 4.7 percent, the lowest in two and a half years. At the same time, investors have poured $236.7 billion into stock-based funds, with last week's inflows of $11.6 billion the most in 17 weeks. Investors even put $2 billion into mutual funds, the first time in 11 weeks that active strategies have attracted money, according to BofAML and EPFR data.
The flows reflect how much more optimistic professional investors have turned.
Bulls in the latest Investors Intelligence survey are up to 60.4 percent, which editor John Gray considers the ""danger zone."" Moreover, he said current patterns are starting to look a lot like 1987 as the market nears the 30th anniversary of Black Monday.
Specifically, he said bulls peaked above 60 percent that year, fell, then moved above 60 again later in the year as the market was about to crash.
""That scenario suggests potential significant danger for Oct/Nov 2017!"" Gray wrote. 
BofAML has been among the most cautious firms on Wall Street, holding a 2,450 S&P 500 price target that would represent a 4 percent decline from the current level.
Generally speaking, Subramanian said she finds it ""very unsettling, the fact that fundamentals aren't driving the bus.""

 Chipotle downgraded by Bank of America on new concern   
 11:20  AM ET Wed, 18 Oct 2017 |  00:45 
 Chipotle has a problem on its hands: labor costs are still too high.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded Chipotle and cut its earnings targets for 2018 and 2019, saying the struggling restaurant chain will have trouble cutting back labor costs any further than it already has.
""We are downgrading Chipotle to Underperform from Neutral as we believe, assuming no significant tax reform, that 2018 and 2019 consensus EPS needs to drop at least 10 percent,"" analyst Gregory Francfort write in a note Wednesday. ""We believe further gains from trimming hours will prove difficult which limits the opportunity to get labor below 27 percent of sales even if traffic recovers.""
 The average weekly hours for full- and part-time Chipotle crew members were cut from a high of 34.6 in 2006 to 21.7 in 2016, according to the Bank of America report.
Chipotle spokesperson Chris Arnold told CNBC in an email that, on the contrary, it has increased hours.
""We absolutely have not cut hours. In fact, we have recently increased scheduled hours for our crew so that our teams would be ready to prepare and serve our new queso. The Bank of America analysis is making estimates and conclusions about our management practices over a 12-year time frame and the scale of our business and labor wages have changed dramatically over that time.""
The Bank of America analyst slashed his 2017 earnings estimate to $7.40 from $7.60, and lowered his 2018 estimate to $9.50 from $10.50. Shares of Chipotle have risen nearly 10 percent over the past month, but remain down over 12 percent this year.
By late morning, shares were down 2 percent following the call.
The company has been testing new products and initiatives to drive traffic to its restaurants after its struggles with food safety outbreaks and subsequent setbacks. Chipotle recently launched its own queso nationwide due to growing competition from California-based Del Taco.

 Trading Nation: S&P's longest winning streak ever   
 3:14  PM ET Mon, 23 Oct 2017 |  04:13 
 As stocks have climbed to record levels this year, investors are neglecting one very important aspect of financial markets, according to analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 That aspect is the existence of risk, said Nikolay Angeloff, equity-linked analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a note Tuesday. ""The market seems to currently imply there is no way a shock can happen,"" he said.
""We have now recorded 334 days without a 5% or more pullback, the fourth longest period since 1928,"" Angeloff said. ""If it continues at this pace, it will be the least volatile October in history and third least volatile month ever."" 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite are all up at least 14 percent year to date. But the market has been steadily rising in 2017, with volatility being virtually nonexistent.
The CBOE volatility index, or VIX, has traded around historically low levels and has had five straight weeks in which it closed below 10. The VIX measures the market's anticipated volatility over a 30-day period using a range of S&P 500 options.

Specialist trader Michael Pistillo Jr. wears a dow 23,000 hat, after the dow briefly traded above 23,000, at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, October 17, 2017.
 ""Markets pricing very little potential for a shock seems at odds with still elevated geopolitical and policy risk globally,"" said Angeloff.
Earlier this month, North Korea Deputy U.N. Ambassador said the situation in the Korean Peninsula has ""reached the touch-and-go point and a nuclear war may break out any moment.""
In Europe, meanwhile, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy moved on Saturday to curtail some of Catalonia's parliamentary powers. Catalonia has been vying to become independent from Spain, and the situation has plunged the country into a geopolitical crisis.
Regardless, U.S. stocks continue to grind higher amid increasing hope that Republicans can move forward with tax reform legislation. 
""I can't tell you when this [bull market] will come to an end, but yes, like all things, this too shall end,"" Gina Sanchez, CEO of Chantico Global, told CNBC on Monday. 
""The concern that I have is, if you look at that complacency, it's largely been fed by a huge drop in correlations. Basically, you are just diversifying away all risk, meaning the underlying stocks are much riskier than the aggregate looks like,"" Sanchez said.
But Angeloff and his team offer an options trade for clients to consider ""if you disagree with themarket's implied belief that risk does not exist.""
The trade consists of buying near-term at-the-money puts and financing that purchase by selling longer-dated lower strike puts that expire in June 2018. By selling those lower strike puts, the trader in this strategy must be willing to get long the market at that strike price, or in this case 2,275 for the S&P 500.
In other words, this strategy offers near-term protection in exchange for getting long the market at 2,275.
Puts are options that give the owner the right to sell a stock, for example, at a given price within a specific period of time.
Angeloff said buying a hedge against the S&P 500 is at its ""most attractive level"" in the past 15 years.

 Three key charts show this bull market has more juice left in it   
 5:14  PM ET Tue, 24 Oct 2017 |  03:39 
 Fears that the rally is on its last legs are a bunch of bull, according to one top technician who has three charts that prove stocks have more room to run.
 ""The S&P trend is still up ... and there's plenty of confirmation,"" wrote Stephen Suttmeier, chief equity technical strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a note this week.
""When I look at that S&P chart, the very, very short-term trend is very bullish, as long as the support zone between 2,567 to 2,547 holds,"" he said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""So as long as you hold Friday's gap and the spike low from Thursday, this trend is still intact and there's upside potential towards that 2,620 to 2,650 range moving into late November."" That's another 3 percent gain for the S&P 500 over the course of the next month.
 Suttmeier also pointed to global participation as a catalyst behind the rally. He noted that the rise of the global weekly advance-decline line — which tracks equities from 73 different countries, including the U.S. – could be signaling an expansion of market breadth.
""The key takeaway from this chart is global breadth is bullish,"" said Suttmeier. ""It's cyclically bullish, similar to how the market was set up in 2013, and I think it bodes well for continued global equity market rally. We don't see any signs of global equity breadth diminishing right here, right now.""
 Finally, Suttmeier pointed to an inverse relationship that has historically hinted at where equities are headed next. Specifically, Suttmeier examined what's called the High Yield Options-Adjusted Index (OAS). ""The OAS is a measure of credit risk,"" said Suttmeier. ""The higher spread suggests increasing risk and a lower spread suggests a more benign environment."" 
Suttmeier's chart shows that the index has moved in the opposite direction from the S&P, and the recent drop in the OAS is coinciding with the market's new highs. According to his chart work, that's a positive for equities.
""When you look at high yield, it's been a great coincident or leading indicator for the S&P 500,"" he said. ""And quite frankly, seeing that high-yield options-adjusted spread go to the lowest levels since June 2014, it bodes well for equities.""
The strategist actually believes the OAS chart is signaling an even bigger drop on the way. This means that if history repeats itself, as the OAS moves lower, then the S&P 500 will rally even higher.
 The S&P 500 is currently up almost 2 percent in October, on pace for its biggest monthly gain since February.

 2:05  PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 |  01:08 
 The head of a major U.S. bank said Thursday that the anonymous nature of digital currencies like bitcoin is what authorities should be most concerned about, and that banks offer more security. 
 Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan pointed out that while major financial institutions send trillions of dollars digitally all the time, cryptocurrencies don't clearly disclose who is involved in a transaction.
""There ought to be a hard look at the policy of anonymous currencies, because the ability to track information of money flowing is one we use seriously against terrorism and as [a tool] against improper, illegal behavior,"" Moynihan said on CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report.""  
 “What our banking system does for this country and the world is we track all this money and the data can be found and then you can do things to find people,"" he said. 
Many people associate bitcoin with illegal activity since it was a major currency for online marketplaces that sold illicit drugs and supported money laundering. 
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink earlier this month called bitcoin an ""index of money laundering.""
Bitcoin transactions are encrypted and recorded in a permanent, online ledger called the blockchain. Users identify themselves with a public address of numbers and letters in order to receive payments.
However, if a user stays with the same public address, intelligence agencies can potentially connect fund flows with an individual. A U.S. Homeland Security official and cryptocurrency analysts told CNBC in August that law enforcement is getting better at tracking down illegal activity in bitcoin, causing some to turn to more encrypted digital currencies.

SCOTT WAPNER: ALL RIGHT. BANK OF AMERICA IS THE TOP PERFORMING FINANCIAL STOCK IN THE PAST MONTH, UP 12%. OUR WILFRED FROST IS IN NEW YORK CITY NOW WITH AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH BANK OF AMERICA CHAIRMAN AND CEO BRIAN MOYNIHAN. IT IS HIS FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE THE BANK REPORTED THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS. WILF.
WILFRED FROST: HEY SCOTT. THANKS VERY MUCH. AS YOU SAID, I'M HERE WITH BRIAN MOYNIHAN. BRIAN, VERY GOOD MORNING – AFTERNOON TO YOU. THANKS FOR JOINING US.
BRIAN MOYNIHAN: THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU FOR COMING TO OUR HOUSE.AND I SEE YOU'VE GOT YOUR BRANDING UP.
FROST: WE DID. WE MANAGED TO SQUEEZE ONE SIGN IN ALONGSIDE ABOUT A HUNDRED OF YOURS. SO I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ABOUT THAT. LET'S TALK ABOUT MARKETS IN GENERAL FIRST OF ALL, BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE THEIR EXTRAORDINARY RISE OF LATE. AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER ALSO THAT CENTRAL BANKS ARE CHANGING DIRECTION, THE ECB THE LATEST TO DO THAT TODAY OF COURSE, AND ALSO THAT HUGE FLOW OF MONEY THAT'S GONE INTO PASSIVE PRODUCTS. DOES IT CONCERN YOU THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A PULLBACK DUE THAT COULD BE BIGGER AND COME SOONER THAN PERHAPS SOME ARE EXPECTING?
MOYNIHAN: WELL, I THINK YOU START WITH THE CENTRAL BANK UNWIND, NEVER BEEN DONE. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK NO CENTRAL BANK'S GONNA UNWIND AND HURT THE ECONOMY OR HURT THE UNDERLYING ECONOMY BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR ROLE IN LIFE IS TO MAKE SURE THERE IS GROWTH AND THINGS LIKE THAT. SO I THINK IT WILL BE – UNTIL IT'S PASSED US, IT WILL ALWAYS BE A QUESTION OF WILL THEY DO IT – WILL IT HAPPEN RIGHT, WILL THE MARKETS RECEIVE IT RIGHT, WILL THE STUFF LAND IN THE RIGHT PLACES AND I THINK THAT'S A CONCERN. I THINK IT'S ONE EVERYBODY IS THINKING ABOUT AND FOREWARNED ABOUT. AND IN TERMS OF THE BROADER MARKET AND THE STRUCTURE OF PASSIVES AND ACTIVES, AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF FLOWS IN BUT THERE'S STILL UNDERLYING SHARES HELD BY A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE. SO I THINK WHILE AT THE EDGES, EVERYBODY GETS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND WE RIGHTFULLY ARE – WE THINK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME THE REALITY IS EVERYBODY HAS LOOKED AT THE LAST FLOW IN AS OPPOSED TO THINKING ABOUT THE BROAD UNDERLYING HOLDINGS SO WELL SEE IT PLAY OUT. THERE ARE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES WITH MORE VOLATILITY IN THE SHORT TERM. RIGHT NOW THERE'S BEEN SO LITTLE, IT MIGHT EVEN HELP A LITTLE BIT FROM TRADING REVENUE.
FROST: IT COULD HELP THE REVENUES, EXACTLY. BUT IN TERMS OF THE RECORD STOCK MARKET CLOSES THAT WE'VE CONTINUED TO SEE RECENTLY, IS THE PRESIDENT RIGHT TO TAKE CREDIT FOR THOSE? HAS HE HELPED DELIVER THEM?
MOYNIHAN: WELL, I THINK MY 200,000 TEAMMATES WOULD THINK THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACT WE DELIVERED $500 BILLION IN EARNINGS AND THINGS. AND I THINK PEOPLE AT EVERY OTHER COMPANY THINK THAT. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THE ENVIRONMENT OF A PRO BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT WHERE POTENTIALLY TAX REFORM BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY REGULATORY REBALANCING, NOT TAKING IT AWAY BUT KINDA COMING IN THE MIDDLE, THOSEARE GOOD IDEAS FOR BUSINESS. AND THEN YOU FORGET THAT THE ECONOMY IS FUNDAMENTALLY GROWING AT 2 PLUS PERCENT AND THAT COMPOUNDS AND COMPOUNDS AND COMPOUNDS AND THAT COMPOUNDS INTO EARNINGS. SO I DON'T TAKE CREDIT WHEN THINGS GO RIGHT OR WRONG. I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD REALIZE IT'S A MULTI-FACETTED QUESTION. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE ENVIRONMENT YOU CREATE, JUST LIKE I HOPEFULLY CREATE FOR OUR TEAMMATES TO GROW, ARE RESPONSIBLE, GO THROUGH THE SAME ENVIRONMENT YOU'RE WORKING IN, IT'S MORE PRO BUSINESS AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT.
FROST: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LOAN GROWTH, YEAR TO DATE FOR THE INDUSTRY, IT'S ESSENTIALLY BEEN FLAT IT'S ONLY UP 1% AND IN FACT, SLOW CORPORATE LOAN GROWTH HAS BEEN A BIG PART OF THAT. IF WE DID SEE A TAX REFORM BILL, DO YOU THINK THERE WOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON METRICS LIKE THAT AND THE ECONOMY STRAIGHTAWAY?
MOYNIHAN: I THINK THERE WILL BE IMMEDIATELY IMPACT AND THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE OPTIMISM WHICH IS BUILT AROUND IT FULFILLED, WHICH HAS BEEN REALLY PART OF THE PROBLEM FOR MANY POLICY DECISIONS, THE OPTIMISM WASN'T FULFILLED. SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD THING. IS THERE DANGER OF A RETRENCHMENT IF IT DOESN'T PASS? YES, ABSOLUTELY. DO WE NEED IT AS A COUNTRY? YES, WE NEED A LOWER TAX RATE TO BE COMPETITIVE. WE NEED TO HAVE GLOBAL – TERRITORIALISM AND WHATEVER WORD YOU WANT TO USE SO PEOPLE DON'T MOVE BUSINESS AROUND FOR TAX PURPOSES. AND SO I THINK THAT'S ALL GOOD.AND SO I THINK AS YOU LOOK AT TAX REFORM AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT, I THINK THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COUNTRY AND I THINK PEOPLE WILL DERRIVE THEIR EXPECTATIONS OFF THAT. IF THEY'RE MORE OPTIMISTIC, THEY'LL BORROW MORE AND LOANS WILL GO UP. BUT WE'RE SEEING DECENT GROWTH IN OUR COMPANY. WE'RE GROWING AT A – OUR COMMERCIAL LOANS YEAR OVER YEAR ARE 5% TO 6% UP. IT'S BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DRIVING RESPONSIBLE GROWTH. SO WE'RE NOT GROWING AS FAST AS OTHER PEOPLE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO, BUT WE'VE BEEN STEADY.
FROST: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR COMPANY AND THE EARNINGS RECENTLY. YOU'VE EXECUTED A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE COST-SAVING TURN-AROUND IN RECENT YEARS. CORE EXPENSES OVER TWO YEARS DOWN $2.4 BILLION, YET CORE REVENUES OF THE SAME PERIOD UP $4.6 BILLION, WHICH A LOT OF THE ANALYSTS HAVE BEEN COMMENDING AND FOCUSING ON. DO YOU NOW NEED TO INVEST IN ORDER TO GROW OR CAN THAT COST CUTTING ALONGSIDE REVENUE GROWTH CONTINUE FOR A COUPLE YEARS MORE?
MOYNIHAN: WELL, THERE WERE -- IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO, IS WE'VE BEEN INVESTING THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH. SO EVEN WHEN WE HAD $72 BILLION IN OPERATING EXPENSES FIVE, SIX YEARS AGO DOWN TO THE 50 ODD WE HAVE NOW, WE WERE INVESTING THE WHOLE WAY MORE. 300 BILLION A YEAR TO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, MORE SALES PEOPLE, NEW BRANCHES, WHATEVER, NEW PHYSICAL PLANT AND STUFF. SO WE'VE BEEN INVESTING ALONG THE WAY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE TALK ABOUT AS PART OF OUR RESPONSIBLE GROWTH THOUGHT PROCESS. AND WE HAVE TO BE SUSTAINABLE. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE IN A SLOW GROWTH ENVIRONMENT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? WE HAVE TO BECOME INCREMENTALLY MORE EFFICIENT. AS WE REACH THE $53 BILLION TARGET WE HAVE NEXT YEAR, WHICH WE'LL HIT, WE TELL PEOPLE TO EXPECT THOSE EXPENSES TO MAINTAIN FLATTISHNESS. NOT NECESSARILY KEEP COMING DOWN BUT AS REVENUES RISE THAT'S A POWER FOR AN OPERATING LEVERAGE PLATFORM. ELEVEN QUARTERS IN A ROW OF OPERATING LEVERAGE, GOTTEN EVER WHICH WAY, SO THIS QUARTER IT WAS 1% REVENUE GROWTH, 3% EXPENSE DECLINE. OTHER QUARTERS IT'S BEEN 4% OR 5% REVENUE GROWTH AND EXPENSES WENT UP A LITTLE BIT. AND THAT – WE'RE GONNA BE MANAGING IT TO MAKE IT HAPPEN BUT IN THE AGGREGATE, YOU EXPECT WE HOLD EXPENSES HERE WHILE REVENUES GROW AND THAT'S POWERFUL LEVERAGE IN A COMPANY LIKE OURS.
FROST: NOW PART OF THE COST CUTTING HAS BEEN REDUCING YOUR HEAD COUNT. 5,000 HEAD COUNT REDUCTION OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. SINCE YOU TOOK OVER, THE HEAD COUNT IS DOWN 74,000 SINCE 2009 OR 26% DOES THE PACE OF THAT HEAD COUNT REDUCTION CONTINUE OR DOES THAT TAPER OFF AS WELL?
MOYNIHAN: IT'S TAPERED, AND IT'S DIFFERENT. IT'S TAPERED BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH TO DO BACK THEN AND WE'RE KIND OF IN A DIFFERENT PLACE. BUT LET'S THINK ABOUT IT YEAR OVER YEAR WE ADDED 2,000 SALES PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME WE TOOK THE HEAD COUNT DOWN BY A THOUSAND OR SO OF TOTAL HEAD COUNT. AND SO WHAT WERE ALWAYS DOING IS REPOSITIONING PEOPLE. SO WE'RE APPLYING TECHNOLOGY TO PROCESS AND THAT ALLOWS YOU TO REDUCE HEAD COUNT. AND THEN YOU GO AND PUT IN A FRONT LINE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT DIMENSION, THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL DIMENSION. SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF SALES PEOPLE IN A COMPANY TO RELATION TO PEOPLE, OVER 40 SOME THOUSAND NOW, UP FROM – ITS LIKE 44 UP FROM 40ISH, BUT THE HEAD COUNT HAS BEEN DOWN A LOT MORE IN THERE WHICH MEANS WE HAVE MORE AND MORE CUSTOMER HELP, CUSTOMER RELATION MANAGERS, MORE GROWTH ORIENTED PEOPLE.
FROST: YOU MENTIONED TECHNOLOGY WHICH LOTS OF THE BANKS TALK ABOUT, YOU DO AS WELL. ARE WE AT AN INFLECTION POINT FOR DIGITAL BANKING WHERE THIS IS GOING TO TAKE OFF AND TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY OR IS IT STILL QUITE A SORT OF A SLOW MOVE INTO DIGITAL BANKING?
MOYNIHAN: IT DEPENDS ON WHICH ASPECT HOW FAST THE GROWTH IS. BUT WE STILL ARE SEEING DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN CORE MOBILE BANKING. PEOPLE DOING MOBILE BANKING WITH US ACTIVE, HAVING USED IT FOR SOMETHING IN THE LAST 30 DAYS. AND WE HAVE A PRETTY – PRETTY HIGH LEVEL OF THEM, PRETTY HIGH PENETRATION. GETTING DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH MEANS THERES STILL DEMAND FOR CUSTOMERS THAT DON'T, SO I THINK YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING LIKE THE CORE ENABLEMENT OF DIGITAL BANK. ANOTHER QUESTION IS WHAT YOU DO UNDERNEATH IT. THAT GETS TO ZELLE. OR THAT GETS TO THE AUTO LOAN MOBILE CAPABILITIES WE HAVE NOW AND THE MORTGAGE LOAN MOBILE CAPABILITIES AND WHAT ERICA WILL BRING. YOU KEEP ADDING FEATURE FUNCTIONALITY CAPABILITIES THAT THE CUSTOMERS DEMAND UNDER THAT. AND THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL SEE THE BENEFITS OF IT. SO YES, THE TOP LINE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE MOBILE BANK CUSTOMERS USED TO GROW 50% YEAR OVER YEAR, 20% AND NOW AT 10%, BUT THE REALITY IS UNDERNEATH THAT, THE WAY THEY USE IT IS TREMENDOUSLY HELPFUL. AND ONE OF THE POINTS I USED WITH OUR BOARD IS YOU'RE SEEING OUR CALLS TO CALL CENTERS DROP 15% PER YEAR BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE USING THE DIGITAL DEVICES TO HELP THEM, TO DO THE WORK, TO FIND THE ANSWERS AND STUFF LIKE. THAT THAT'S A POWERFUL TRADE FOR US, EVEN IF IT DOESN'T RESULT IN A SALE WHAT IT'S RESULTING IN IS PEOPLE GETTING BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE.
MOYNIHAN: AND LOWER COSTS AS WELL. BRIAN, WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FROM THE STUDIO.
WAPNER: BRIAN, IT'S SCOTT WAPNER, THANKS FOR COMING ON THE PROGRAM. THANKS FOR COMING ON HALFTIME. I DO HAVE A COUPLE THINGS FOR YOU AS WE START TO LOOK AHEAD TO WHO MAY BE THE NEXT CHAIRMAN OR CHAIR OF THE FED. DO YOU THINK JANET YELLEN HAS DONE A GOOD JOB AND DO YOU THINK SHE SHOULD BE REAPPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT?
MOYNIHAN: I THINK THE QUESTION WHO THE REAPPOINTMENT IS UP TO THE PRESIDENT AND OTHERS. IN TERMS OF, THE FED HAS DONE A GREAT JOB I THINK OF GUIDING THIS ECONOMY, THE LARGEST IN THE WORLD, BACK FROM OVER THE LAST EIGHT, NINE, TEN YEARS NOW INTO A PLACE THAT'S VERY CONSTRUCTIVE, GROWING AT 2%. SO I THINK -- BUT I'LL LEAVE THE APPOINTMENTS UP TO THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY MAKE THEM.
WAPNER: DO YOU THINK IT MATTERS TO THE MARKETS WHO THE NEXT CHAIR OF THE FED IS? I MEAN, GIVEN WHAT YOU SAID, IT WOULD SEEMINGLY NOT MATTER TO YOU. YOU MUST HAVE AN OPINION OF WHO MAY BE BETTER FOR YOUR BUSINESS IN THE WAY THE MARKETS WORK?
MOYNIHAN: I THINK ANY -- YOU KNOW, I THINK JUST LIKE WHEN I BECAME CEO, THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE TASK WHEN YOU TAKE OVER A STEWARDSHIP OF IN THAT CASE THE FEDERAL RESERVE MONITOR POLICY I THINK WILL RESULT IN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MANY MEMBERS ON THE PROCESS COMMITTEE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DATA. I THINK WHERE PEOPLE MAKE GREAT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A OR B OR C, AT THE END OF THE DAY THE REAL FACTS BEAR OUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AND I THINK IT WILL BE LESS IMPACTFUL FOR OUR BBUSINESS THAN PEOPLE MIGHT SPECULATE.
WAPNER: THE OTHER THING IS, IM LOOK AT A STORY RIGHT WITH A HEADLINE, AND I QUOTE ""BIG BANKS SCORE WIN WITH SCRAPPING OF CONSUMER CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT RULE."" IT REFERS TO THAT SENATE VOTE YESTERDAY, ROLLING BACK THAT REGULATION THAT WOULD HAVE RESTRICTED MANDATORY ARBITRATION BY 2019. IT WOULD HAVE GIVEN CONSUMERS THE ABILITY TO FILE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, AS YOU KNOW. GIVEN THE SHENANIGANS THAT WENT ON AT WELLS FARGO AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED AT THE BANKS THROUGHOUT THE LAST MANY YEARS, DO YOU THINK THAT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION YESTERDAY BY THE SENATE?
MOYNIHAN: WELL, I THINK YOU HAVE TO SORT THAT OUT. AS IT RELATES TO OUR COMPANY, WE HAVENT HAD ARBITRATION IN OUR DOCUMENTS AND CARD SINCE 2009 IN DEPOSIT PRODUCTS A SIMILAR LENGTH OF TIME AND MORTGAGES BEFORE THAT SO IT REALLY WASN'T A RELEVANT ISSUE FOR BANK OF AMERICA. WE DON'T HAVE THOSE CLAUSES AND HAVEN'T FOR MANY YEARS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN THE BROADER CONTEXT, AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE INDUSTRY, THE LESSENING OF REGULATION OF SMALL AND MIDSIZE BANKS IS A REAL ISSUE. AND WE AS BIG BANKS HAVE BEEN FOR THAT IN HELPING TO TRY TO CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE OF WHICH THAT HAPPENS. SO I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER CASE WHERE THERE'S A BELIEF IN THE SYSTEM OF THE SMALL AND MIDSIZE BANKS THAT THEY'RE OVERREGULATED AND THIS WAS ANOTHER INTRUSION AND THAT WAS WHAT YOU SAW REFLECTED IN THE VOTE. BUT TO BANK OF AMERICA, IT WASN'T A RELEVANT QUESTION.
FROST: GIVEN THAT THE WELLS FARGO SCANDAL HAS RATTLED ON SO LONG, HAS THAT ANNOYED YOU AND SOME OF YOUR FELLOW CEOs AS BANKS THAT STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE CROSS HAIRS A LITTLE BIT. HAVE YOU FELT THAT IT'S DRAGGED THE INDUSTRY BACK INTO THEM A LITTLE?
MOYNIHAN: OUR CUSTOMER SCORES ARE AS HIGH AS THEY HAVE EVER BEEN, HIGHER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE THE CRISIS, HIGHER THAN WHEN THE STOCK PRICE WAS THIS OR THAT. AND SO I THINK OUR CUSTOMERS SEE IN OUR COMPANY WHAT WE DO FOR THEM THE WAY WE RUN THE BUSINESS MODEL, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR MANY YEARS NOW. IT'S RESPONSIBLE GROWTH. WE TRY TO GET THE PRIMARY CHECKING ACCOUNT IN THE HOUSEHOLD. WE WANT THE PRODUCTS TO BE USED. SO I THINK IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN THAT IMPACTFUL ON US.
FROST: SWITCHING FOCUS, BRIAN, A LOT OF YOUR PEERS HAVE MENTIONED BITCOIN RECENTLY OR BEEN ASKED ABOUT BITCOIN RECENTLY. WHICH CAMP DO YOU FALL INTO, THE FRAUD CAMP OR THE OPPORTUNITY CAMP?
MOYNIHAN: I THINK THE QUESTION ANONYMOUS CURRENCY IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH FROM A POLICY DECISION. THE ABILITY TO TRACK MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY MOVING THROUGH IS TRICKY. THE IDEA OF DIGITAL CURRENCY IS NOTHING NEW. WE'LL SEND OUT – HALF OF OUR CONSUMER PAYMENTS WHICH ARE 2 TRILLION DOLLARS YEAR TO DATE ARE DIGITAL. SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NEW OR DIFFERENT. IT'S THE ANONYMOUS THING THAT CAUSES DEBATE FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. FROM THE SPECULATION, I'LL LET YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT WHAT IT'S WORTH. BUT THERE OUGHT TO BE A HARD LOOK AT THE POLICY OF ANONYMOUS CURRENCY BECAUSE THE ABILITY TO TRACK IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE USE AGAINST TERRORISM AND AGAINST IMPROPER, YOU KNOW, ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY THERE'S ONLY $100 BILLS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY. IS YOU DON'T WANT LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO TRAVEL WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BANKING SYSTEM DOES FOR THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLD IS WE TRACK ALL THIS MONEY AND THE DATA CAN BE FOUND AND THEN YOU CAN DO THINGS TO FIND PEOPLE, BAD ACTIVITIES, ETC.
FROST: SO BITCOIN IS CURRENTLY USED FOR CRIME, IN PART?
MOYNIHAN: YOU CAN READ THE STORIES, AS I CAN.
FROST: QUESTION AGAIN FROM THE STUDIO, FROM JOE.
JOE TERRANOVA: GOOD AFTERNOON MR. MOYNIHAN. THIS IS JOE TERRANOVA. SO, I CHECK BOTH BOXES, BOTH AS A SHAREHOLDER AND A CUSTOMER AND I'M VERY HAPPY WITH BOTH OF THOSE CONDITIONS YOU'VE DONE A FANTASTIC JOB OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. BUT NEARLY NINE YEARS AGO YOU PICKED UP THE MERRILL LYNCH FRANCHISE FOR $50 BILLION. AS WE SIT HERE TODAY, YOU SEE THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS PASSIVE INVESTING. I READ SO MANY ANALYSTS NOTES AND THE FIRST THING THEY SAY IS IT'S TIME FOR MR. MOYNIHAN TO SPIN OFF MERRILL LYNCH OR EVEN TO SELL IT. WHERE DOES MERRILL LYNCH FIT IN RIGHT NOW IN YOUR VISION FOR THIS COMPANY MOVING FORWARD?
MOYNIHAN: WELL, THE ISSUES FACING THE WEALTH INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS FROM REVENUE COMPRESSION, PASSIVE INVESTING TRENDS, AUTOMATION, ROBO ADVISERS AND ALL THOSE THINGS, WE WILL DRIVE THAT THROUGH, JUST LIKE WE'VE DONE IN ALL OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, APPLYING THE TECHNOLOGY IN A WAY THATS GOOD FOR OUR CUSTOMERS AND GOOD FOR OUR TEAMMATES AND YOU'LL SEE US CONTINUE TO DO THAT. SO OUR MERRILL LYNCH IS ONE OF THE
FASTEST GROWING ON THAT SIDE OF THE BUSINESS. WE'RE GETTING TREMENDOUS SHARE IN THE 1 MILLION ABOVE INVESTORS. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE SORT OF BETWEEN WHERE THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND STUFF, YOU HAVE TO BE VERY EFFICIENT FORTHE INVESTOR GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND REVENUE STREAMS FOR THAT. SO ANDY SIEG AND TERRY LAUGHLIN AND KEITH BANKS AND KATY KNOX ARE ALL WORKING ON THIS. AND YOU KNOW, SPINNING IT OFF WOULD BE NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY AND IT'S A VALUABLE PART OF WHAT WE DO AND IT'S AN ITEGRATIVE PART OF WHAT WE DO. WE'LL HAVE TREMENDOUS REFERRAL FLOW BETWEEN MERRILL LYNCH U.S. TRUST, BETWEEN THE CONSUMER BUSINESS TO MERRILL LYNCH, BETWEEN THE 401(k) PLATFORM, ALL THESE BUSINESSES ARE MUCH MORE POWERFUL ALIGNED AND DRIVEN ON A CUSTOMER FOCUSED BASIS THAN A STAND-ALONE COMPANY IS. AND SO IT PROVIDES GREAT VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR TEAMMATES AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.
PETE NAJARIAN: BRIAN, THIS IS PETE NAJARIAN. REAL QUICK QUESTION ABOUT LOAN GROWTH. IT WAS SO IMPRESSIVE THIS LAST QUARTER, THE CUSTOMER LOAN GROWTH THAT YOU GUYS WERE ABLE TO PUT UP. BY THE WAY, I'M A SHAREHOLDER SINCE 2014. I BELIEVE IN THE COMPANY.
MOYNIHAN: THANK YOU.
NAJARIAN: JUST LIKE BUFFETT. I CONTINUE TO THINK YOU GUYS ARE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT. HOW DOES THE LOAN GROWTH LOOK TO YOU GOING FORWARD FROM HERE AS WE START TO SEE THE TEN-YEAR AND ALL THE REST OF THE MOVEMENT THAT WERE STARTING TO SEE IN THE BOND WORLD.
MOYNIHAN: WELL, WE SEE -- IF YOU START FROM WHAT DRIVES THE US CONSUMERS -- THE ECONOMY, THE CONSUMERS DO. WE'VE SEEN YEAR-TO-DATE CONSUMER PAYMENTS, CASH, CHECKS WRITTEN, DEBIT/CREDIT CARDS ARE UP, 6%, 7%, WHICH IS ALMOST TWICE THE RATE THEY WERE UP THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS YEAR OVER YEAR AND THAT'S THROUGH TEN MONTHS ALMOST. SO YOU KNOW, CONSUMERS ARE GONNA DRIVE THAT ECONOMY. LOANS WILL FOLLOW THAT. OUR JOB IS NOT TO CREATE THE ECONOMY, OUR JOB IS TO FACILITATE IT AND PROVIDE THE GREASE THAT MAKES IT HAPPEN AND SO OUR LOAN GROWTH IS REFLECTING THAT. AND I THINK THAT CAPITAL MARKETS ARE WIDE OPEN SO THAT PUTS PRESSURE ON PEOPLE, GET OUT TO THOSE MARKETS GET OUT AND FUND THAT WAY, BUT THAT'S PART OF THE FLOWS AND WE DO THAT BUSINESS ALSO. SO I THINK YOU'LL SEE GOOD, SOLID MID, SINGLE DIGIT LOAN GROWTH FROM US IN THE CONSUMER BUSINESSES YOULL SEE SLIGHTLY FASTER IN THE CORE BUSINESSES BECAUSE OF THE CATCHUP IN MARKET SHARE THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF GETTING.
FROST: BRIAN, JUST A QUICK QUESTION ON BREXIT AS WELL. WE HEARD FROM LLOYD BLANKFEIN THEY SAID HE WAS GOING TO SPEND A LOT MORE TIME IN FRANKFURT. YOU'RE MOVING SOME HEAD COUNT TOWARDS DUBLIN. HOW SIGNIFICANT A MOVE IS THAT? DO YOU FEEL BREXIT IS SHAPING UP
THE WAY THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO LONDON AS A FINANCIAL CENTER?
MOYNIHAN: I THINK IT'S NOT GOOD, BECAUSE IN THE END OF THE DAY, WITHOUT BREXIT HANGING OVERHEAD, WE'D JUST BE OUT PLUGGING AWAY, WORKING FOR CUSTOMERS, YOU KNOW, ADDING PEOPLE, BRINGING TEAMMATES INTO LONDON ALL OF THAT GETS PULLED INTO QUESTION SO IT'S NOT GOOD. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT EVERYBODY THINKS ABOUT TRADERS LIKE THIS ON THE FLOOR, IT'S THE ACCOUNTANTS WHO SUPPORT THEM, IT'S THE HR TEAM THAT SUPPORTS THEM, IT'S THE LEGAL TEAM THAT SUPPORTS THEM, IT'S THE INVESTMENT BANKERS, IT'S THE CORPORATE BANKERS, IT'S THE PEOPLE THAT RUN THE CASH MANAGEMENT FRANCHISE. SO THE IDEA TO HAVE A HUB THAT SUPPORTED A REGION OF THAT SIZE AS BIG AS THE UNITED STATES IS NO DIFFERENT THAN NEW YORK TO THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES. NOW WHEN I THINK ABOUT I CAN'T QUITE OPERATE THIS WAY, IT'S DISRUPTIVE. AND BY THE WAY, EVERY INDUSTRY IS GOING THROUGH THIS AND I THINK IT BEHOOVES US ALL TO GET A SET OF RULES WE CAN UNDERSTAND. THE PEOPLE VOTED. WHICH, DID WE ALL WANT IT NOT TO HAPPEN? SURE. BUT THEY VOTED, IT'S GONNA HAPPEN AND NOW THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE RULES I THINK IF WE CAN GET SOME RULES WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS TO EVERYONE IF WE DO THIS PERFECTLY, THE CLIENTS DON'T GET ANY BETTER SERVICE. IF WE DO IT PERFECTLY. SO THERE'S NO UPSIDE, IT'S JUST CAN WE AVOID THE DOWNSIDE. WHETHER IT'S LLOYD OR MYSELF OR JAMIE, JAMES, EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THE DOWNSIDE DOESN'T OCCUR, THERE'S NO DISRUPTION IN THE MARKETS, DISRUPTION OF CLIENT FLOWS, THE COSTS GO UP TO A POINT WHERE YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT COST DEPLOYMENT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID. THAT NEVER PLAYS WELL TO THE INCUMBENT AND THAT'S WHAT LLOYD IS FACING.
FROST: ALRIGHT, WELL, BRIAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN ON THE LAST SET OF NUMBERS, THE SHARE PRICE UP NICELY SINCE THEN. AND IT'S BEEN GREAT TO BE BACK
HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
MOYNIHAN: THANK YOU. THANK YOU GUYS ON THE DESK TOO.

52,2017-10-31,"The space industry will be worth nearly $3 trillion in 30 years, Bank of America predicts  ","SpaceX | Flickr 
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket takes off on its mission to deliver the EchoStar 105/SES-11 satellite to space.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch sees the size of the space industry octupling over the next three decades, to at least $2.7 trillion.
 ""We are entering an exciting era in space where we expect more advances in the next few decades than throughout human history,"" the firm wrote in a report on Monday.
As the cost of space access plummets, BofAML joined Morgan Stanley among Wall Street investment banks bullish on the extraterrestrial industry. Both put the space market today at around $350 billion, but BofAML's outlook is nearly triple Morgan Stanley's expectation of a $1.1 trillion market by 2040.
 ""A raft of new drivers,"" BofAML said, is pushing the ""Space Age 2.0"": reusable launch by SpaceX, the growth of private ownership in the market, investment by more than 80 countries and the falling launch costs from vehicles by the likes of Rocket Lab and Vector.
The firm cautioned that this is a market where companies traditionally have had trouble turning profits.
""However, for investors with a truly long-term time horizon, we see it as one of the final frontiers of investing,"" BofAML said.
There are only five ""pure play"" companies — defined as having 100 percent of sales in the space business — in the firm's report. All five work with satellites, with ViaSat and Intelsat SA based in the U.S., while Inmarsat, SES and Eutelsat are based in Europe. The companies are also fairly small, with values ranging from $500 million to $9.6 billion.
While the report highlights more than 70 global stocks, the remainder have medium-to-low exposure to the space industry's growth. Other opportunities range from incumbent aerospace and defense companies — Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman — to technology giants — Facebook, Google and Microsoft.
Space is ""a hotbed for disruptive technologies,"" the firm said. Today's benefit from satellites is nearly immeasurable, and massive projects such as the International Space Station or the Stratolaunch aircraft are possible only through the industry's growth.

A Help Wanted sign is seen in Miami, Fla.
 Drugs, jail and video games have taken millennial men out of the workforce and they aren't likely to return —a phenomenon dubbed ""the tale of the lost male"" by economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 A decline in the labor force participation rate since the financial crisis masks stark differences between men and women, wrote Bank of America economists Michelle Meyer and Anna Zhou on Friday.
""Prime-working age women (25-54 years old) have returned to the labor force with a participation rate edging back to pre-crisis levels,"" they wrote, ""but the participation of prime-working age men has remained close to recession lows.""
 Male employment fell by a cumulative 6.9 percent during the recession compared with a 3.2 percent drop for women, noted the economists. But a closer look into the data reveals that the lack of labor participation among younger, millennial men is ""particularly acute,"" offset by an uptrend in participation among men aged 45-54 years old.
To be sure, while much of the decline in the participation rate is due to the aging population, the recession hit men especially hard. The goods-producing manufacturing and construction sides of the economy — where men typically hold higher rates of employment – hemorrhaged workers as the housing bubble burst.
Such a disastrous economic setback discouraged younger generations from seeking skills in those fields. And as a result, the average age of a construction worker in the U.S. increased to 42.7 in 2016 from 40.4 before the crisis, according to Meyer and Zhou.

But that's not the only reason the economists believe millennial men are not (or not trying to be) employed.
Citing work from Princeton's Alan Krueger, the economists note that the rise of opioid prescriptions from 1999 to 2015 could account for 20 percent of the decline in the male participation rate. The 2013 American Time Use Survey found that 43 percent of prime-age men who were not in the labor force indicated having fair or poor health, way higher than the 12 percent for working men.
But men may also be putting a priority on leisure, which could be keeping men at home. The U.S. Labor Department's American Time Use Survey found that between 2004 and 2007 and from 2012 to 2015, the average amount of time men aged 21 to 30 worked declined 3.13 hours per week while the number of hours they spent gaming increased 1.67 per week, according to the economists.
Work by Krueger finds that game playing is associated with increased happiness and less fatigue than TV watching and is now considered a social activity.
But whatever the reasons, a quick look at recent jobs data will provide even more evidence. The largest relative increases in the ratio between job openings and hires have been in construction, transportation and utilities. This chronic lack of workers was no better highlighted than in the aftermath of two hurricanes this fall, as homeowners in Florida and Texas scrambled to find assistance in repair.
""This is the goods side of the economy where men tend to be a larger share of the working population, therefore highlighting the challenges in the economy from the shortage of men participating in the labor force,"" concluded Zhou and Meyer. ""The consequence: the cries of labor shortages will remain loud.""

Traders gather for the IPO of Singapore-based Sea Limited on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 20, 2017.
 Appetite for risk has increased among money managers to a new high, according to the latest fund manager survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BoAML).
 A total of 16 percent of investors said they are taking above normal levels of risk when choosing where to put their money, even though 48 percent of respondents said that equities were overvalued.
""Icarus is flying ever closer to the sun and investors' risk-taking has hit an all-time high,"" Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BoAML, said in a statement Tuesday, borrowing a phrase from Greek mythology.
 ""A record high percentage of investors say equities are overvalued yet cash levels are simultaneously falling, an indicator of irrational exuberance,"" he added.
This means that though investors think that stocks are too expensive, they are still pushing money into those equities, which indicates that they think markets will continue to rise despite these lofty valuations.

 Meanwhile, more and more fund managers do not see benefits of investing in U.K. equities, the survey said. 37 percent of those surveyed said to be ""underweight"" on the market — a low not seen since during the financial crisis of 2008.
Twenty-three percent of respondents had an ""overweight"" rating on Japanese equities, the highest level seen in the last two years.
""Global fund managers see the profit outlook in Japan as favorable amid a strong earnings season,"" Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX/equity strategist at BoAML, said in a statement.
""Investors continue to see Japan equities as undervalued relative to other markets and say they want to overweight Japan for the next 12 months,"" he added.

 GE has zero transparency and it's a tragedy to see it like this: Bill George   
 11:56  AM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 |  02:15 
 While many of its peers are giving up on General Electric, Bank of America Merrill Lynch still recommends the industrial giant's stock. 
 We are ""sticking with a buy despite a disappointing outlook,"" analyst Andrew Obin wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We believe that GE has significant cost cutting opportunities under the new leadership. We note that the company has undergone a significant reinvestment cycle, positioning the company well from a competitive standpoint.""
General Electric shares had their worst day since 2009 on Monday, falling 7 percent after the company reduced its dividend and unveiled a restructuring plan during its investor day. It was the company's first investor day under CEO John Flannery, who replaced Jeff Immelt in August.
 The shares fell some more on Tuesday, down another 6 percent midway through the trading day.

 10:00  AM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 |  02:09 
 The analyst reiterated his buy rating and lowered his price target to $23 from $27, representing 21 percent upside to Monday's close.
Obin shared his top reasons why investors should own General Electric:
 1. ""The dividend cut is now behind us."" 2. ""While lower '18 outlook v. our and consensus' forecast was not expected, we view the current outlook as the 'true reset.'"" 3. ""GE is prefunding $6bn of its pension obligations in '18 by issuing debt, ameliorating some of the concerns about off-balance-sheet liabilities."" 
He also said the company has the opportunity to create value by selling some of its businesses.
""We continue to believe that SOTP [sum-of-the-parts method] is the key valuation metric for the stock, particularly as we think GE will be more aggressive on portfolio reshaping v. what the market thinks,"" he wrote.
Nearly 70 percent of Wall Street does not have buy ratings for General Electric shares, according to FactSet. Such a mixed view for a large industrial conglomerate is a rarity.
General Electric shares are significantly underperforming the market so far this year. The stock has declined nearly 40 percent year to date through Monday's close versus the S&P 500's 15.5 percent return.

58,2017-11-17,"Investors are fleeing junk bonds in near record numbers, a troubling signal for the stock market  ","Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images
 Though stock market prices have held up in November, investors generally are running from risk at a near-record pace.
 Judging from the flow of money out of high-yield bonds, investors are getting increasingly leery of a market that continues to hover around record levels, despite a handful of rough trading sessions in November and a rocky start Friday.
Funds that track junk bonds saw $6.8 billion of outflows over the past week through Wednesday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That's the third-highest on record.
 The sector is considered a key proxy for the stock market, with performance that has followed almost a perfect correlation with the S&P 500 in terms of direction. Bonds are normally thought as a safe-haven trade that benefits when stocks weaken, but high-yield represents a risk similar to equities.
The correlation in 2017 has varied: September was the high for the year at 76 percent, while June was just 42.4 percent, according to DataTrek Research. (100 percent would mean the assets move exactly in tandem.)
Despite the stock market rally, returns for high-yield this year are muted, with the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF up just 1.1 percent. The ETF has seen $1.4 billion in outflows over the past month, according to FactSet. 
However, there's some optimism that the selling will be short-lived. Citigroup analyst Michael Anderson thinks high yield will rebound heading into the end of the year.
""Month to date, there have been more block-sized client buys than sells. This indicates to us that positioning is supportive and cash balances are fairly robust,"" Anderson said in a note to clients. ""With a light pipeline ahead, we believe investors will not be looking to make room for new issues.""
Funds that focus on stocks took in $3.2 billion for the week. However, that was distorted by a huge inflow of $9.9 billion into exchange-traded funds, while longer-term mutual funds suffered $6.7 billion in outflows, the most of 2017.
Investors were focused on safety, with investment-grade bonds gathering $4.8 billion in flows while Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities took in $400 million, the best showing in 38 weeks.

A pedestrian passes in front of a statue of a bull in the Wall Street area in New York City.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch sees a scary good news-bad news scenario unfolding in 2018: A solid push higher in the first half followed by all sorts of potential trouble after.
 The S&P 500 would peak out around 2,863 in the scenario, or about 11 percent higher than Monday's close. Bond yields are expected to rise, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hitting 2.75 percent as global GDP growth reaches 3.8 percent.
That setting assumes three things: the ""last vestiges"" of stimulus from the Fed and other central banks, the passage of tax reform in Congress, and ""full investor capitulation into risk assets"" on better-than-expected corporate earnings.
 After that, though, things get considerably sketchier as the second-longest bull market in history runs into trouble.

 Real battle for leadership in this market: State Street's Michael Arone

 ""We believe the air in risk assets is getting thinner and thinner, but the Big Top in price is still ahead of us,"" Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at BofAML, said in a report for clients. ""We will downgrade risk aggressively once we see excess positioning, profits and policy.""
Indicators that market positioning has gotten out of hand and signaling a fall would include active funds attracting more money than passive (there's a $476 billion gap this year in favor of passive), and portfolio allocation for equities exceeding 63 percent, a level currently at 61 percent.
Hartnett pointed out that the current bull will be the longest in history if it continues to Aug. 22, 2018, while the outperformance of stocks versus bonds, at seven years running, would be the longest streak since 1929. 
The forecast is predicated on three core beliefs: The first is the aforementioned capitulation; the second an expectation of ""peak positioning, profits and policy"" that ""will engender peak asset price returns"" and a low in volatility; and, finally, an expectation that higher inflation and corporate debt along with tighter monetary policy will roil the corporate bond market, a critical prong of the risk asset rally.
""The game changer is wage inflation, which on our forecasts is likely to become more visible,"" said Hartnett, who projects that salaries could rise 3.5 percent and push the consumer price index up 2.5 percent and convince the Fed that it's close to meeting its 2 percent inflation goal.
However, that cuts both ways: Should wage inflation again fail to materialize, Hartnett said ""the era of excess liquidity"" continues, bond yields would fall and the Nasdaq tech barometer would go ""exponential."" That would signal a bubble that might not end until 2019, when a bear market would be triggered by ""hostile Fed hiking, Occupy Silicon Valley and War on Inequality politics.""
""Big Top"" trades favor technology, homebuilders, Japanese banks and the dollar against the Swiss franc. 
BofAML's forecast comes as Goldman Sachs released a price target of 2,850 for the S&P 500, after a comparatively bearish 2016 call for 2,400 that was passed six months ago.

 Dick Bove: Here's the one bank you want to buy   
 10:08  AM ET Fri, 24 Nov 2017 |  02:09 
 Bank stocks have lagged the broader market over the last month, and veteran analyst Dick Bove has one name to buy and sell into the end of the year.
 ""[I would] buy Bank of America and short Goldman Sachs,"" Bove said in a recent interview on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""
The Vertical Research Group analyst sees extensive and continued growth ahead for Bank of America, which has surged 21 percent this year. Despite reporting on Oct. 13 that fixed income trading revenue fell 22 percent year over year in the third quarter, the bank beat its earnings on the top and bottom line, and Bove says it will only get better from here.
 ""Bank of American is phenomenally good. ... If we take a look at the growth of money supply [that we assume is at 6 percent] over the next four or five years and Bank of America deposits grow along with money supply, this means one out of every $9 in growth of money supply winds up in Bank of America,"" he said. ""And then we take a look at the growth in GDP, which let's say is 5.5 percent on trend, and that means Bank of America gets one out of every $20 in terms of loans.""
Given such optimistic projections, ""it's very likely that Bank of America's earnings will be up 10 percent a year for the next five years,"" said Bove, who predicts shares of the bank could rally to $61.50 by 2023. This means he sees the bank soaring 130 percent from Friday's levels.
Goldman Sachs is another story. While the Dow component also beat earnings on the top and bottom line back on Oct. 17, Bove insists that trouble is to come for the bank based on its earnings over the past few years.
""Goldman Sachs earnings are now down from where they were 10 years ago,"" said Bove. ""They're down below what they were five years ago, they're down below what they were last year, and I assume they're going to be down below where they were in the last quarter.""
What's more, the analyst also sees management, particularly CEO Lloyd Blankfein, as standing in the way of the bank's growth.
""The net effect is this is a company which has this mystique, which is it doesn't matter where they earn money, as long as they pay their executives a lot,"" he said. ""If they do that, then people want to buy the stock.""
""But the fact is there needs to be a sweeping change at the top of this company, including a change in the CEO because it doesn't make money, it doesn't make money on an incremental basis,"" he added.
Shares of Goldman are down almost 1 percent from the start of 2017, a sharp contrast to Bank of America's performance.

 Trump's D.C. will drive bank stocks higher   
 6:40  PM ET Thu, 30 Nov 2017 |  01:13 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer hates parabolic moves, like the one he noticed in bitcoin's rapid surge on Wednesday.
 ""I particularly despise parabolic rallies, the kind with a huge upward slope, when you see them in slower growing industries. There's a word for that kind of action, and the word is 'unsustainable,'"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Yet that's exactly what's been happening with the bank stocks in the last 72 hours, parabolic moves that seem hard to justify based on the numbers.""
The pattern worried Cramer because he knew the bank stocks — namely Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America — couldn't keep going up at this speed. It dragged everything into question: their valuations, their earnings and whether they were safe investments.
 Moreover, the XLF, the exchange-traded fund that lumps the financials in a group, makes those details difficult to pin down.
The ETF causes the financials to trade in unison based on how many times the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates, as each hike means more profit for the banks.
""The thing is, they really shouldn't be trading in lockstep,"" Cramer said. ""Some of these banks are dramatically undervalued on certain metrics. For example, [Citigroup's] tangible book value — what it would be worth if you shut down the company and liquidated everything — is just below the current stock price. That's too cheap.""
By his fairly conservative estimates, Cramer predicted another 5 percent rise for the XLF based on the possibility for four more rate hikes.
Bank of America would be a particularly big beneficiary of hikes thanks to its large deposit base, which would justify its seemingly inflated valuation. Plus, with the Trump administration unraveling Obama-era regulations on banks, Bank of America's earnings power can go up more than people realize, Cramer said.
""It's very difficult to argue that the stock's expensive. And other than the pricey JPMorgan, I could say the same thing about most of the [bank] stocks: they're still too cheap,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""So, sure, you can trim your positions in the banks, since no one likes to be a pig,"" he continued. ""But unlike so many other areas where valuations are getting pretty stretched, I think the financials, on the whole, have room to run, maybe a lot of room to run now that we have a government that's way more pro-banking than any I have ever seen.""

 Tax reform will provide a boost across multiple areas, for consumers, the broad economy and Wall Street, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Tuesday.
 With Congress on the cusp of sending a bill for President Trump to sign, the head of the second-largest U.S. bank by assets strongly touted the benefits of a measure that will slash corporate tax rates and provide various levels of breaks to many individuals.
""By and large, we pay a lot of taxes and we'll get a benefit,"" Moynihan said during an interview with CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" program. ""Really, the benefit will be in American society and the broad economy.""
 BofA has been the best performing big bank on Wall Street this year, with shares surging nearly 32 percent as it has benefited from a looser regulatory environment and as rising margins have helped offset the decline in trading that has affected multiple institutions.
The firm on Tuesday announced it was buying back an additional $5 billion of shares through mid-2018, seemingly good news though shares were little changed in morning trade.
Moynihan said the buybacks were the result of the company having strong levels of excess cash — an 11.9 percent capital ratio compared to the required 9.5 percent, translating into up to $25 billion.
""Our job is to move that out,"" he said.
That happens against a conducive backdrop in which the company has seen ""fairly consistent"" loan growth and a growth in both the U.S. and global economy that is helping offset some of the other weaker parts of the business.
In addition to proving that ""a pro-business environment exists"" in Washington, tax reform will help boost and economy already showing signs of breaking out, Moynihan said.
Holiday shopping showed a sharp gain this year, as judged by the jump in receipts BofA saw from credit and debt card purchases, he added.
""That means things are going on in the economy, which is good,"" Moynihan said. ""The consumer's in good shape.""

Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.
 Shares of Bank of America rose 0.3 percent in Tuesday midday trading after the bank announced it would be buying back an additional $5 billion worth of shares.
 The board of directors approved the additional repurchase, which will occur through June 2018. The company had previously announced plans to repurchase $12 billion in common stock earlier this year. 
In a statement from Bank of America, the repurchase program ""will be subject to various factors, including the company's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time.""
 Bank of America shares are 31 percent higher this year, with a 4 percent jump in the last one month alone, as investors bet that banks will be one of the top beneficiaries of tax reform.
CEO Brian Moynihan is speaking at the Goldman Sachs financial services conference Tuesday morning and will also be appearing from there in an interview on CNBC.

 BofA's Savita Subramanian: We're not at 'euphoric' levels in the market   
 7:31  PM ET Tue,  5 Dec 2017 |  04:13 
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists see the S&P 500 ending 2018 six percent above current levels, but they say it could be the year when the aging bull sees late stage euphoria.
 BofA strategists expect stocks to outperform bonds for a seventh consecutive year in 2018, a run not seen since 1928. They are overall bullish on stocks, bearish on bonds, long U.S. dollar, and long on volatility.
Savita Subramanian, Bank of America chief U.S. equity and quantitative strategist, does not yet see euphoria, which would indicate a coming end to the bull market.
 Her year end target of 2,800 is just above the median 2,750 forecast of 11 other equity strategists surveyed by CNBC. The forecast gain for 2018 is modest when compared to the gain of 18 percent for the S&P 500 so far in 2017.
The strategists unveiled their outlook at a briefing Tuesday.
Michael Hartnett, BofA head of global investment strategy, said the S&P could run up as high as 2,850 in the first quarter before a sharp mid-year sell off.  ""Our overall outlook for the year ahead is macro bullish, so much so that we're ultimately market bearish,"" said Hartnett, who has a  different view than the U.S. strategists.
""We think euphoria is what's going to end this bull market and we're not there yet,"" Subramanian said. ""We're not at the point where the investment community is saturated in equities and there's nothing to do with stocks but sell.""
Subramanian said her model does not yet show a correction, in a later interview on CNBC.
Subramanian said she watches the market calls of other Wall Street strategists and they are not indicating too much bullishness.  ""We still think there's a ways to go before we have Wall Street telling you to back up the truck on stocks,"" she said.
""Your average Wall Street strategist is telling you to put about 55 percent of your wealth into equities. While this is a lot higher than what Wall Street was recommending in 2012, when they had thrown in the towel on stocks,"" Subramanian said. ""55 percent is still well below the levels of euphoria that herald the end of a bull market.""
The BofA strategists are more bullish on tech and materials for 2018, but they warn inflation could be a risk.
""Our proprietary indicators suggest that inflation pressures are building, which could not only hasten Fed tightening,"" they wrote in the note. Other risks include geopolitics, a credit crunch, a more hawkish Fed and the end of quantitative easing.
The strategists raised tech to overweight from market weight and boosted materials to overweight from underweight, because of its momentum. Technology has been selling off in recent sessions due to concerns it will benefit the least from tax reform and could be impacted negatively on research and development.
They view the bull market as being in its late stages and for that reason see momentum as the best way to invest. Momentum usually outperforms by 22 percentage points in the 12 months before the market's peak, they note. High dividend yielding stocks and small caps tend to under perform during that stage so they prefer large caps.
Tax reform is the earnings ""wild card for 2018"" and is a potential upside risk to their forecast. The strategists see 6 percent earnings per share growth for the S&P 500, about half the consensus expectation.
""Tax reform should not be a reason that your pounding the table bullish for equities,"" Subramanian said.
A corporate tax rate of 20 percent and repatriation driven stock buybacks could add as much as $19 to S&P 500 earnings, with $3 from the buybacks, according to the BofA strategists. 
Subramanian said a concern is how much of the tax break impact will be lasting, and not just ""competed away."" They expect $11 or 8 percent to be a recurring benefit to earnings.
In other stock sector moves, health care was lowered to market weight from overweight due to decelerating fundamentals and increased positioning risk. Real estate was also reduced to underweight from market weight, as it and utilities are most exposed to the risk of dividend yield trades falling out of favor. The strategists also maintain their overweight on financials and underweight on utilities and consumer discretionary.
The BofA strategists had a bull case target of 2,700 on stocks for 2017, and a bear case of 1,600, but Subramanian said the strategists weighed other concerns when setting their target below current market levels and their model was more correct.

 Analyst cuts EA profit estimates after social media uproar leads to 'Star Wars' game sales plunge   
 9:18  AM ET Tue, 12 Dec 2017 |  00:52 
 Electronic Arts will reinstitute in-game purchases in its ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" title despite recent wavering by one of its top executives, according to a Wall Street firm.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch lowered its price target and profit forecasts for Electronic Arts shares due to poor sales of the ""Star Wars"" game.
""EA has had a challenging C4Q, beginning with the shutdown of Visceral Games and now Battlefront 2 (BF2) controversy,"" analyst Justin Post wrote in a note to clients Monday entitled ""Lowering ests for BF2; Stock weakness sets up for a better 2018."" ""As controversy subsides post-holidays, we expect investor interest to pick up ahead of a stronger FY19 title slate, renewed digital optimism, and operating leverage potential. Battlefront MTX relaunch and FIFA World Cup content launch are key 1H events.""
 Post maintained his buy rating and reduced his price target to $130 from $137 for Electronic Arts shares, representing 23.5 percent upside to Friday's close.
The analyst noted how EA shares have ""materially underperformed"" since the end of September falling 11 percent versus the S&P 500's 5 percent return. He said November U.S. physical game unit sales of ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" declined 52 percent versus 2015's ""Star Wars Battlefront"" in its first month, according to NPD sell-through data.
As a result, Post predicts the title will miss the company's guidance of 14 million unit sales by 2.5 million. The analyst lowered his earnings estimates for EA's fiscal 2018 earnings-per-share to $4.22 from $4.28. He also reduced his fiscal 2019 forecast to $5.02 from $5.14.
Electronic Arts announced Nov. 16, a day before the ""Star Wars Battlefront II"" game's official launch, that it is temporarily turning off all in-game purchases for the game in response to negative sentiment from gamers.
""It's clear that many of you feel there are still challenges in the design. We've heard the concerns about potentially giving players unfair advantages. … Sorry we didn't get this right,"" EA wrote in the post.
The company told gamers then it will change the micro-transaction model for the game in the future. However, EA's chief financial officer, Blake Jorgensen, at NASDAQ investor conference on Dec. 5 seemed to be open to turning off micro-transactions permanently for the title.  ""Over time, we'll address how we will want to bring the MTX either into the game or not and in what form we'll decide to bring it into,"" he said.
Post still predicts EA will relaunch micro-transactions for the ""Star Wars"" game.
""Battlefront 2 MTX likely to return next year,"" he wrote. ""Perhaps the biggest stock negative from the BF2 MTX issues is the potential negative impact on FY19 MTX revenues … That said, even with 12mn in total units sold and an average of $10 of MTX per game sold, BF2 could still do over $100mn in MTX.""
Here are the different ways the analyst suggested EA can add in-gaming purchasing back into the title:
 ""Focus MTX on cosmetics … we see some room for skins such as light saber and blaster coloration, vehicles appearance modifications, and potentially hero costumes from different scenes/events in the movies."" ""Supporting heroes to unlock/purchase. Locking iconic heroes like Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker upset the player base, but rolling out new supporting heroes from the comics/movies would likely see less pushback. Also, players may be more open to purchasing via MTX vs grinding additional currency later in the game lifecycle."" ""Integrate a visible collectable. Other games have created visible (but subtle) collectible items available with achievements, currency, or MTX (i.e. virtual companions/pets)."" ""Single player downloadable content. EA could introduce expansions to the single player campaign, driving additional player spend without fragmenting the multiplayer universe."" 
EA's stock is up 34 percent year to date through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 18 percent gain.
The company declined to comment on this story.

The Bitcoin cryptocurrency symbol on a stone sphere monument painted black by unidentified persons in Oktyabrskaya Square in Yekaterinberg, Russia.
 More traditional money managers are worried about bitcoin than ever before.
 The soaring digital currency topped the list of ""most crowded trades"" — a measure of sentiment on which a popular investment could quickly reverse its gains — in Bank of America Merrill Lynch's December global fund manager survey released Tuesday. 
The survey found that 32 percent of respondents named bitcoin as the most crowded trade in the financial world, up from 26 percent in September when the digital currency first led the list. At the time, bitcoin had surged about 375 percent for the year to $4,600.
 But clearly that was not the top, despite a rocky September for bitcoin in which the digital currency briefly plunged more than $2,000 as China cracked down on cryptocurrencies and J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a ""fraud"" that ""won't end well.""
December's ""most crowded trades""
 Source: BofAML
Bitcoin has roughly quadrupled since September to briefly trade above $19,000 in the last week. Fueling part of the rally was the launch of bitcoin futures on the CME, the world's largest futures exchange, and its competitor the Cboe's Futures Exchange.
The BofAML survey, conducted from Dec. 8 to 14, covered 172 global fund managers with a total of $480 billion in assets under management. It's widely considered one of the best surveys of investors conducted on Wall Street.
Another crowded trade is betting on the stocks of U.S. and Chinese technology giants, 29 percent of respondents said.
""FAANG,"" or Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix and Google's parent, Alphabet, are each up nearly 37 percent to 60 percent this year, versus the S&P 500's 20 percent gain. Chinese e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba has soared 97 percent, search engine Baidu has climbed nearly 47 percent, and Hong Kong-listed tech and gaming giant Tencent has leaped more than 110 percent.
The term ""FAANG"" came about in reference to a handful of high-flying stocks in which much of the market's gains were concentrated. The surge of the Chinese conglomerates has earned them the nickname ""BAT.""
Bitcoin performance (July to December)
 Source: CoinDesk
Technology stocks overall are the best performers in the S&P this year with gains of nearly 40 percent.
However, investors are not overexuberant about the gains. The BofAML survey found that allocation to tech stocks in December fell to the long-term average of 24 percent overweight. 
Overall levels of cash holdings among the fund managers rose to 4.7 percent, slightly above the 10-year average of 4.5 percent and back into the territory signaling ""buy,"" BofAML said.
Global money managers also called out short volatility, or betting on calm markets, as a crowded trade. Noted investors such as DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach have said for months that a ""massive amount of money"" is short volatility indexes, and the extended period of subdued market performance should soon result in a sharp increase in volatility.

 Bank of America is giving some employees a $1,000 bonus, citing tax bill   
 4:02  PM ET Fri, 22 Dec 2017 |  00:47 
 Bank of America will give some of its employees a $1,000 bonus, citing the tax bill that was just signed into law.
 ""Beginning in 2018, we will see benefits from the tax reform ... in the form of lower corporate tax rates,"" CEO Brian Moynihan said in an internal memo to employees obtained by CNBC. He also said that about 145,000 employees will receive the bonus.
President Donald Trump signed a bill on Friday that overhauls the U.S. tax code. One of the biggest changes it makes is slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
 Bank of America is the latest company to take this sort of action following the passage of the tax bill. Here's a scorecard of the announcements from the largest U.S. companies.
Read Moynihan's full memo below:
 To my teammates: As we approach the end of the year and another holiday season with family and friends, it's a good time to recall the progress we made this year in living our purpose: To help make financial lives better through the power of every connection. We did this the right way, through responsible growth. Through the third quarter, we have earned $15.7 billion – an improvement of nearly 20 percent from 2016 – by focusing on our customers and clients, managing risk, and doing it in a sustainable way. As we have discussed often, sustainability has many dimensions. Sustainability includes all of our ESG work, including responsible corporate governance, and our $125 billion environmental initiative. At the end of this year, we'll be nearly halfway through that 10-year goal, which we announced in 2015. Sustainability includes the many ways we share our success with the communities we serve, through our $200 million in philanthropy and the more than 2 million hours of time you and your teammates volunteer to help worthy causes we care about. Sustainability also means operational excellence, continuing to improve our company and reinvesting those savings into future capabilities. Another dimension of sustainability is our commitment to be a great place to work. We focused on that in many areas this year. In February, we crossed the $15 per hour level after years of regular increases in the starting compensation level for U.S. teammates, a level we've seen other companies start to match more recently. We will continue to review and adjust that as part of our commitment to fair and equitable compensation for all of our teammates. We also kept our 2017 annual medical premium increases below the national average and lower than many other large companies, and will do so again in 2018. We have taken a long-term approach to managing this program. For U.S. employees making less than $50,000 a year, we decided in 2010 to reduce annual medical premiums for 2011 by 50 percent for family coverage and have kept premiums flat for six consecutive years. For employees making between $50,000 and $100,000 per year, we reduced the premiums by 15 percent in 2011 and have kept premium growth well below the national trend. Also this year, in October we adopted an extended bereavement policy to provide up to 20 days paid time for the loss of a spouse/partner or child. This follows our 2016 industry-leading expansion of paid parental leave to 16 weeks. Together with these improvements, teammates in 2017 also derived significant benefits from our leading programs for career development and learning, wellness, diversity and inclusion and support for life events during moments that matter most. We saw too many such events this year between man-made and natural disasters, but we also saw how much we accomplished by coming together as a team to help each other, and help our clients and communities. Against the backdrop of the progress we made this year, I want to highlight the December 20 passage in the United States Congress of the most fundamental tax reform since 1986. When the legislation is signed into law by the President, these reforms will impact our company in different ways. For instance, we will see an immediate reduction in earnings as a result of a write-down of the value of our deferred tax asset. Beginning in 2018, we will see benefits from the tax reform, too, in the form of lower corporate tax rates. In the spirit of shared success, we intend to pass some of those benefits along immediately. U.S. employees making up to $150,000 per year in total compensation – about 145,000 teammates – will receive a one-time bonus of $1,000 by year-end. We also continue to see the benefits from economic growth in the United States, the EU area, and Asia, including additional lending and rising U.S. interest rates. Combined with the lower tax expense, we may have the opportunity to accelerate investments we are making in many areas, including:• Accelerate both the consumer capabilities build-out in Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, Denver, and other key markets where we serve clients but lack an extensive financial center network, and the refresh of financial centers elsewhere• More accelerated Wi-Fi expansion for those parts of our financial center network without it• Greater technology spend to continue to improve our mobile, digital, and AI-assisted capabilities, including Zelle and Erica• Continued electronification of our Global Markets sales and trading capabilities We have work ahead to continue to drive responsible growth, deliver results, and continue to share our success. We made great progress this year, and we will continue that next year I'm sure. Enjoy the holiday season, get some rest, and let's look forward to a strong 2018. Thank you.

75,2018-01-02,A Merrill Lynch indicator that predicted last year's surge sees another 19% gain in 2018  ,"Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images
 Stocks could pop nearly 20 percent in 2018 according to a contrarian indicator from Bank of America Merrill Lynch which predicted last year's surprising surge.
 The investment bank's so-called Sell Side Indicator measures the average equity allocation recommended by its fellow Wall Street bank peers. The indicator shows Wall Street is still not very bullish on the market at all and until strategists recommend clients own even higher levels of stocks, the market will continue to gain.
""Historically, when our indicator has been this low or lower, total returns over the subsequent 12 months have been positive 93 percent of the time, with median 12-month returns of 19 percent,"" according to a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report.
 In September 2016, the metric predicted a huge positive return over the next 12 months, a forecast that eventually came true and stood in contrast to the sentiment on Wall Street at the time. Now in early 2018, the model still remains upbeat.
2018 ""could be the year of euphoria. Sentiment is now a more important driver of the S&P 500 than fundamentals, and sentiment suggests there is still room for stocks to move higher in the near term,"" wrote BofA Merrill Lynch strategists in the 2018 outlook press release in December. 
To be sure, this indicator is only one input in Bank of America's bigger forecast model. Officially the bank predicts just a nearly 5 percent rise in the S&P 500 to 2,800 this year.
 The strategist's target is just below the median 2,850 forecast of 13 other equity strategists surveyed by CNBC. That median projection is modest in comparison to the roughly 20 percent climb for the S&P 500 in 2017.
""We think euphoria is what's going to end this bull market and we're not there yet,"" Savita Subramanian, the bank's chief U.S. equity and quant strategist, told CNBC in December. ""We're not at the point where the investment community is saturated in equities and there's nothing to do with stocks but sell.""

Chuck Robbins, CEO of Cisco
 Cisco Systems rose 1.38 percent to its highest level in nearly 17 years on Friday, after an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock.
 Analyst Tal Liani upgraded shares of Cisco to buy from neutral and raised his price target to $46 from $37. The new target is 18 percent above Thursday's closing price. The stock traded at $39.67 at 10 a.m. ET.
""The company is in the early stages of a positive transition to software,"" Liani said. ""While the strategy shift is not new, we believe now is the right time given the added benefit of domestic capex tailwinds and tax reform.""
 Cisco shares are up more than 3.5 percent this week, building on strong gains from 2017. The stock jumped 26.7 percent last year. By comparison, the S&P 500 gained 19.4 percent in that time period.
 Liani also noted Cisco has strong free cash flow and a low valuation compared with its competitors. ""Cisco's valuation discount versus the market has consistently widened over the last 5 years and Cisco is still one of the cheapest stocks versus all large-cap tech and networking peers,"" the analyst said.

An American Airlines Inc. McDonnell Douglas MD-82 plane sits parked at a gate while a United Continental Holdings plane taxis down the runway at LaGuardia Airport in the Queens borough of New York.
 Tax reform should boost business travel this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and that in turn will boost shares of the country's biggest airlines, including American Airlines, United Continental and Delta, the investment bank said.
 ""We view tax reform as a significant positive for corporate spending (banks, media companies and even airlines have given $1,000 one-time bonuses to employees), and we believe this can drive a pickup in corporate travel pricing,"" wrote analyst Andrew Didora.­­ ""Since 2014, we estimate corporate pricing is down 14 percent. ... This coupled with strong international fundamentals should create a solid backdrop for the legacy airlines that are more levered to corporate travel than domestic, leisure-oriented airlines.""
The analyst changed his tune on American Airlines, upgrading the company to buy from underperform, and reiterated his buy ratings on Delta and United. American and United traded higher Tuesday following the bullish call. Delta initially rose but then headed into negative territory.
 Given that those airlines generate roughly two-thirds of their revenue from business travel, any recovery in corporate pricing as a result of the Republican tax plan should disproportionately benefit those companies, Didora said.
All three underperformed the S&P 500 in 2017, though United disappointed the most, plagued with public relations problems throughout the year. Some extra cash as a result of revived corporate travel could be the key for improving equity prices.
""In a scenario in which corporate prices returned to the same levels as four years ago, corporate revenues could grow 15 percent, driving a strong fundamental backdrop for the industry and an even better outlook,"" added Didora.
The new tax law includes a corporate tax rate of 21 percent, down from 35 percent in an effort to make the U.S. more competitive globally. The law is expected to free up cash in a slew of industries, including industrials and financials.
Though more bullish on some names, the analyst did issue some downgrades as well. Cutting his rating on Southwest and Alaska to neutral from buy and downgrading JetBlue to underperform from buy, Didora noted that domestic travel could suffer at the hands of international and business trips.
""We believe Southwest is the highest quality airline in the group with a very conservative balance sheet and low earnings volatility,"" he said. ""However, we expect business travel and international markets to outperform Southwest's largely domestic-oriented system in 2018.""
The same assessment applied to Alaska, which Didora called ""an exceptionally well-run airline"" despite its focus on domestic travel.
Shares of Alaska and Southwest fell Tuesday, down 0.5 percent and 1 percent respectively. JetBlue was up slightly.

Will Smith in Netflix film Bright.
 Netflix's lead in the internet video streaming market is so large the company's poorly reviewed movies can do well, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating for Netflix shares, citing the success of its movie ""Bright.""
""Netflix ended the year with the release of major film Bright, which despite weak critic reviews, had an estimated 11mn viewers in the first three days, roughly on par with a successful blockbuster movie opening in the theaters and nearly the numbers we saw from the highly anticipated second season of Stranger Things,"" analyst Nat Schindler wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""We expect Netflix to continue to increase spending on original content and feature films to grow subscribers, which would lead to healthy top line growth.""
 Schindler raised his price target for Netflix shares to $233 from $225, representing 10 percent upside from Monday's close.
""Bright"" received the approval of just 27 percent of the critics on Rotten Tomatoes.
The analyst noted Netflix already announced a sequel to ""Bright,"" which means it is satisfied with the performance of its first large budget movie. He also said the movie did better viewership than the company's ""The Crown"" season 2.
""We continue to think Netflix is in a strong position to capitalize on the shift to on demand viewing, the acceleration of cord cutting and the global demand for premium video content,"" he wrote. ""Netflix is in a unique position where it can afford to spend on acquiring and producing premium content and still have that spend be efficient given its global subscriber base.""

 Billionaire Sam Zell on markets: I think the current situation seems like irrational exuberance   
 8:00  AM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  05:05 
 Professional investors are going all in on the raging bull market, reducing cash allocations to the lowest level in five years and putting the most money in stocks in two years.
 As the market looks to continue its best ever start to a year, respondents to the January Bank of America Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey are showing that optimism has not dimmed, even after 2017's big 20 percent gain. Stocks were looking at another strong performance Tuesday, judging by early trading action.
Hedge fund managers say their own equity exposure — 49 percent net long — is at the highest since 2006 as the level dedicated to hedging strategies against a possible market downturn falls to its lowest since 2013.
 ""Investors continue to favor equities,"" Michael Hartnett, BofAML's chief investment strategist, said in a statement. ""By the end of Q1, we expect peak positioning to combine with peak profits and policy to create a spike in volatility.""
Hartnett is far from alone in his forecast for a volatility spike. Most Wall Street strategists issued the same call in their 2018 outlooks, and in fact have been anticipating that the market's smooth ride higher over the past year would come to an end any day now.
However, that's not been the case.
The Cboe Volatility Index, a popular measure of investor fear, was last above 20 — its long-term average — in early November 2016. Since then, it's been mostly all oars in the water as even retail investors seem intent on getting into the action.

 In 2018 alone, exchange-traded funds have raked in more than $16.5 billion in fresh cash, according to FactSet. Coming in barely two weeks' time, that's well ahead of the $6.5 billion a month pace over the past 12 months.
Pros responding to the BofAML survey say they remain unfazed by the market surge and don't see the top coming until sometime in 2019.
That optimism is fueled largely by hopes for global growth, with a net 47 percent saying they expect the economy to be stronger over the next 12 months, a 16 percentage point gain from December.
They see far greater risks in the bond market, which they rate the top ""tail risk"" while at the same time rating bets against volatility to be the most crowded trade. In fact, the level of managers overweight stocks compared with government bonds is at its highest level since 2014.
Investors rate inflation or a bond crash as the biggest market danger for 2018, replacing fears of a policy mistake by the Fed or the European Central Bank. Fears of protectionist policies, spurred by some of President Donald Trump's rhetoric, have diminished to 63 percent of those surveyed, though that's up from the long-term average of 45 percent.
In sector allocations, managers say they're moving out of telecom and into tech, industrials and emerging markets. The iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets fund has pulled in $1.3 billion in creations for 2018, the third most of any ETF.
The high optimism among fund managers correlates with other investor surveys.
The American Association of Individual Investors saw bullishness take a dip over the past week, but those expecting gains over the next six months outnumber those who think the market will fall by a 48.7 percent to 25.1 percent. The spread is even wider in the Investors Intelligence count of market newsletter authors, with the bull-bear spread at 64.4 percent to 13.5 percent, the biggest gap since April 1986.

Apple chief executive Tim Cook visits an Apple store in Glasgow.
 Apple shares will thrive this year due to tax reform, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating and raised its price target to $220 from $180 for Apple shares, which is 25 percent above Tuesday's closing price. It is also the highest target among major investment banks that cover Apple. The $220 forecast represents a $1.1 trillion market valuation for the company.
""We remain bullish on potential for cash repatriation, lower tax rates, and the potential for positive estimate revisions heading into 2019,"" analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ""A smoother iPhone cycle (no boom-bust) should drive increased stability in earnings, commanding a higher multiple.""
 Mohan noted that Apple has $253 billion in overseas cash. He estimates $236 billion is available to be repatriated to the U.S. at the new 15.5 percent tax rate under the tax reform bill.
""After paying out the taxes, Apple would have $200bn of cash back on-shore in the U.S. (which it could potentially use for buybacks, dividends, or M&A),"" he wrote.
Only Drexel Hamilton has a higher price target for Apple at $235.

 Cramer still confident on most major banks   
 7:04  PM ET Wed, 17 Jan 2018 |  01:06 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer firmly believes that the financial stocks are the most important leadership group in the market, so he wanted to check in with some of its biggest players after earnings.
 When Cramer told viewers what to look for from the banks' earnings reports last week, he  anticipated the hefty, one-time charges many of them incurred to take advantage of newly enacted tax laws.
""I know it was pure accounting gimmickry, but I worried that it might freak out investors. Turns out there was no need to worry,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup all delivered substantial earnings beats, even as only J.P. Morgan and Citi actually gave you that higher-than-expected revenue that I like to see.""
 For Cramer, the ""headline numbers"" — how the earnings and revenue results compared to analysts' estimates — were less important than the banks' net interest margins, loan growth and capital return plans.
The net interest margin, or the difference between what banks pay individuals for their deposits and the interest they collect on loans, is the primary way banks make money.
Despite concerns of a flattening yield curve, J.P. Morgan's net interest margin rose by 5 basis points from last quarter to 2.42 percent, beating expectations, and Bank of America's increased by 3 basis points to 2.39 percent.
However, Citigroup's net interest margin fell by 9 basis points to 2.63 percent and Wells Fargo's dropped by 2 basis points to 2.84 percent.
As for loan growth, a key line item for gauging the welfare of the economy, the banks also delivered fairly healthy results, Cramer said.
J.P. Morgan's consumer average loan balances rose 1.7 percent versus last quarter, a sign that consumers are warming up to borrowing money, a trend that stimulates economic activity.
Better yet, J.P. Morgan's commercial average loan balances rose by 7 percent, commercial and industrial loans were up 6 percent, and commercial real estate loans increased 9 percent.
Citigroup's total loans were also up 5 percent versus last quarter, which Cramer called ""very good."" Conversely, Bank of America's total loans were up by a meager 1 percent and Wells Fargo's total commercial loans rose by less than 1 percent.
Finally, Cramer turned to the banks' capital return plans, a central topic of discussion amid the Trump administration's easing regulatory regime.
""Now, J.P. Morgan and Citi, and Bank of America all said that their approach to dividends and buybacks won't change because of the tax bill,"" Cramer said. ""But all four of these companies have been voracious buyers of their own stock, especially Bank of America and Wells Fargo, and if the Fed gives them permission to even increase their repurchase programs, I think they'll do just that.""
All things considered, Cramer thought J.P. Morgan reported a solid quarter, with good loan growth, deposit growth, an expanding net interest margin and expectations of a 19 percent tax rate.
But Bank of America delivered what Cramer saw as one of the best quarters in the group, especially with its lack of exposure to the weakness in trading and fixed income revenues — two of J.P. Morgan's weak spots.
""Bank of America is exactly the kind of financial you want to own in this environment,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""They have the most rate sensitivity to rising interest rates because they have such a gigantic deposit base.""
Citigroup's quarter was always going to be marred by its $19 billion one-time charge, but its loan growth was ""encouraging,"" Cramer said.
Wells Fargo was Cramer's only real disappointment. The big bank, still embroiled in reputation repair after its cross-selling scandal, seemed to be struggling to capture new customers, which explained its declining net interest margin numbers and loan balances, he said.
""The company also saw a big pickup in costs thanks to their litigation expenses, and while I think the whole group is poised to go higher here ... I'm going to call [Wells Fargo] my least favorite,"" Cramer added.
As for the stocks themselves, Cramer used tangible book value — what the business would be worth if it was shut down and liquidated — to determine their valuations.
J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo were the most expensive, trading at 2.1 and 2 times book value, respectively. Bank of America was trading at 1.85 times book value, and Citi, the cheapest, came in at 1.28 times book value.
""My view? J.P. Morgan remains best of breed, but as usual, you need to pay up for best of breed. ... If you want the best play on rising interest rates, go for Bank of America, and if you're looking for the value in the group, it's Citi. As for Wells, I think it's going to play catch up to the others because it looks to be out of the woods with the regulators, although I still prefer the others,"" Cramer said. ""The bottom line: after hearing from most of the major banks, I remain confident about the financials as a place to be.""

 Concerns over a possible government shutdown, however, weighed on market sentiment, causing major markets to end in the red.

 Bank of America posts earnings beat   
 7:04  AM ET Wed, 17 Jan 2018 |  01:59 
 Bank of America reported better-than-expected adjusted fourth quarter earnings Wednesday after a jump in loan growth offset a drop in fixed-income trading. Shares fell though as investors focused on quarterly revenue which fell slightly short of expectations.
 The bank also posted a charge of $2.9 billion related to the new tax law.
Excluding the tax bill-related items, the bank reported:
 Adjusted earnings per share of 47 cents, versus expectations of 44 cents from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Adjusted revenue of $21.4 billion, versus expectations of $21.531 billion.  
Bank of America shares are up nearly 36 percent over the last 12 months. The stock declined 2.4 percent on Wednesday.
""We gained market share across our businesses while carefully managing credit, risk exposures, and expenses,"" CEO Brian Moynihan said in a statement. ""We invested in technology, client engagement, and in our own team, including the $1,000 bonus we announced last month for 145,000 employees.""

Brian Moynihan, Bank of America
 Moynihan had announced the bonus in late December, citing the tax bill that President Donald Trump signed cutting the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
CFO Paul M. Donofrio added Wednesday on a call with media that the bank expects its effective tax rate for 2018 to fall to 20 percent from 29 percent.
Bank of America's net interest income rose 11 percent to $11.5 billion in the fourth quarter, helped by higher interest rates and loan and deposit growth. The bank said on a conference call Wednesday it expects ""solid"" growth in net interest income this year. 
Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter rose to $1.2 billion, ""primarily driven by a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off totaling $292 million,"" according to the earnings statement.  
J.P. Morgan Chase said Friday it lost $143 million in the fourth quarter on a margin loan to a single client and said it was likely other financial firms had exposure to the client. The bank did not name the client, but said it was related to struggling South African retailer Steinhoff International. During a call with media Wednesday, Bank of America executives declined to comment on specific client information.  
""Client activity was strong across all of our businesses in 2017,"" Donofrio said. ""Our balance sheet remains strong and we believe we are well positioned for growth.""
Analysts were watching for the impact of low volatility and the new tax legislation on the bank's fourth quarter results. 
The bank reported fixed income trading revenues fell 13 percent in the quarter, excluding net debit valuation adjustment. Revenue from equities trading was unchanged.
Bank of America said in a Dec. 22 filing it expects a $3 billion hit to fourth quarter results as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And in early December, Moynihan said trading revenues were tracking for a 15 percent decline in the fourth quarter from the same period last year. 
In its earnings statement, J.P. Morgan Chase reported a 34 percent drop in fixed income markets trading revenue in the fourth quarter. Earnings per share and revenue both beat expectations. 
Wells Fargo on Friday reported an earnings beat, helped by the new tax law. But the bank's quarterly revenue missed expectations. 
Most banks have reported a fourth quarter-hit from the new tax legislation. J.P. Morgan announced a $2.4 billion charge. On Tuesday, Citigroup posted a one-time, noncash charge of about $22 billion for the fourth quarter due to the new tax law. Excluding that charge, the bank reported better-than-expected earnings per share, helped by growth in consumer banking. 
Goldman Sachs on Wednesday reported a $4.4 billion tax-related charge, which resulted in a net quarterly loss. Excluding the charge, the investment banking giant posted better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings, but revenue from fixed income markets trading plunged 50 percent.
Morgan Stanley is set to post results Thursday.

 Cramer: Heed Bank of America's warning on bitcoin   
 10:48  AM ET Wed, 17 Jan 2018 |  01:01 
 Investors should heed Bank of America's warning on bitcoin and other virtual currencies, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday.
 During a post-earnings call Wednesday morning, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan responded to a question about cryptocurrencies after the company banned financial advisors from buying bitcoin-related investments for their clients.
""We have limited our relationships,"" Moynihan said about cryptocurrencies in a media call. ""We basically told people they could buy at other accounts, not at Merrill Lynch.""
 ""I think they're right,"" Cramer said about BofA on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I mean they have a lot of consumer business that's digital. They'd rather not deal with a currency that's not a currency.""
Bitcoin was falling for a second day on Wednesday, breaking below $10,000 for the first time since November. Ethereum and ripple, the second- and third-biggest digital assets, respectively, continued to move lower as well.
""I'm not saying they think it's going to die,"" said Cramer, host of ""Mad Money."" ""I'm just saying that they think, 'Why the heck do we need this?'""
Later on the call, Moynihan reiterated his worries that cryptocurrencies make it difficult to track fund flows by criminals.
Meanwhile, BofA reported better-than-expected adjusted fourth-quarter earnings earlier Wednesday, but revenue fell slightly short of expectations. Despite not helping customers invest in bitcoin, the bank has applied for patents in blockchain technology.

84,2018-01-18,Bank of America loses its second head of tech and media banking in less than a year  Watch out for tighter monetary and fiscal policies in China  ,"Bank of America's global head of technology, media and telecommunications investment banking Anwar Zakkour is planning to depart to pursue other opportunities, according to an internal e-mail obtained by CNBC and confirmed by a bank spokesman.
 His departure marks the second global head of the group to leave in less than a year. Zakkour's co-head, Chet Bozdog, retired in March. Zakkour has been the sole head of the group since Bozdog's departure. 
Zakkour joined the bank in 2013 after eight years at J.P. Morgan Chase, including the last two as global vice chairman of investment banking. Some of his recent deals include selling the Los Angeles Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, representing Verizon on its acquisition of Yahoo's Internet core business, and selling Time Inc. to Meredith. 
 Zakkour will be replaced by Jack MacDonald, currently co-head of global M&A. MacDonald will remain in Palo Alto, California, and report to Diego De Giorgi, head of global investment banking, according to the memo. MacDonald has been with the firm since 1995 and has advised on more than $500 billion of deals during his career, according to the memo.
Zakkour will depart next month and will take some time before deciding on his next position, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the matter is private. 
Before joining Bank of America, Zakkour worked on some of the largest and most influential media and telecom deals ever, including Verizon's $130 billion deal with Vodafone to buy the 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless it didn't already own, and General Electric's sale of NBCUniversal to Comcast. 
Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

85,2018-01-19,"Gaming giant Nvidia, after 113% gain, could surge another 23%, BofA analyst says  ","Rick Wilking | Reuters
Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, shows the Drive Pegasus robotaxi AI computer at his keynote address at CES in Las Vegas, January 7, 2018.
 Nvidia shares will surge again this year due to a strong upgrade cycle in its gaming graphics chip business, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 BofAML raised its price target for the chipmaker to the highest among the firms covering Nvidia, citing the company's product leadership in multiple growth areas in technology.
Nvidia has been one of the best performing stocks in the market during the past year. Its shares are up 113 percent in the previous 12 months compared with the S&P 500's 24 percent return.
 The company's shares were up 1.6 percent in Friday morning trading.
While Nvidia ""trades at a premium valuation, we believe this is justified by Nvidia's leadership in the largest and fastest growing markets in semis including [artificial intelligence], gaming, [virtual reality], and autonomous cars,"" analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients Thursday. Arya said there's a ""large upgrade opportunity for Nvidia cards.""
Arya reiterated his buy and top-pick ratings for Nvidia shares. He raised his price target to $275 from $251, representing 23 percent upside from Thursday's close. He now has the highest price target on the stock out of 29 analysts, according to FactSet.
The analyst said the company's current generation ""Pascal"" gaming graphics cards have 40 percent share of Nvidia card owners on PC gaming distribution platform Steam. He said there is still ""a large upgrade potential"" from the previous Nvidia ""Maxwell"" cards, which are at 48 percent share.
""Separately, Nintendo Switch console [with its approximately $40 Nvidia processor] became the best-selling console of all time in the US during its first 10 months on the market,"" he wrote. ""Lastly, we expect Nvidia to start rolling out its next-gen Volta cards in likely just the premium segment, during 2H18, which could create further upgrade and [advance simulation products] tailwinds.""

 General Electric shares are plummeting on an epic selloff   
 2:57  PM ET Mon, 22 Jan 2018 |  00:43 
 General Electric shares continued to plumb new depths after Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded the troubled bellwether on Monday.
 The shares fell 0.55 percent Monday to close at $16.17 and touched an intraday low of $15.80, their lowest in six years. The stock fell last week below $17 a share after GE said earlier in the week that it would take a $6.2 billion after-tax charge because of its GE Capital insurance portfolio and that it expects to contribute $14 billion over the next seven years to shore up the company's reserves.
Analyst Andrew Obin told investors that the industrial conglomerate is likely to slash its 2018 outlook when it reports fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.
 Our outlook ""reflects lower earnings estimates, zero equity value assigned to GE Capital, and lower value assigned to GE Digital initiatives, as we don't see the market paying up for this optionality,"" wrote Obin in a note to clients. ""The relative size of the charge vs. expectations and limited disclosure related to potential off-balance sheet liabilities once again raise a question about the credibility of the current guidance and capital structure framework.""

 General Electric has learned its lesson in trying to please Wall Street too much: WSJ's Dennis Berman   
 1:57  PM ET Mon, 22 Jan 2018 |  02:37 
 The analyst has a 12-month price target of $17 and downgraded the stock to neutral from buy.  The shares are down 47 percent over the past 12 months.
Obin's view echoes the concern of the market's last week, that not even a breakup can stop the recent slide. The company may move to split itself as early as this spring, sources told CNBC's David Faber last Tuesday.
""Our view is that General Electric's key challenge is in North America and it relates to the lack of robust demand for new gas-fired power capacity coupled with an installed fleet that is coming off Long Term Service Agreements that were put in place as far back as 2000,"" Obin explained.""Because of a relatively benign demand environment, operators in many cases choose lower cost third party service and parts providers as they are looking for 'good enough' v. top tier, higher cost service options that optimize performance provided by General Electric.""
General Electric has hemorrhaged value over the past year as new CEO John Flannery attempts to turn the conglomerate around. The company recently cut its dividend to raise funds, but alienated many longtime investors in the process.

 Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists say this could be a record year for merger activity and corporate spending should help continue to fuel stock market gains.
 The strategists Tuesday raised their target for the S&P 500 and said the long-awaited 'great rotation' of funds out of bonds and into stocks that would signal the end of the bull market has yet to occur. Stocks valuations are elevated but are relatively cheap by a wide margin, compared to bonds, they say.
The strategists, among a few in CNBC's survey at the low end of Wall Street's range, have raised their S&P 500 target to 3,000 from 2,800, and are now in line with the median, which had been at 2,975.
 ""While 2017 saw building optimism, 2018 may be the year of euphoria. While valuations have overshot fair value, sentiment is likely to be the most important driver of returns — typical of late stage bull markets,"" they wrote. They put fair value for year end 2018 at 2,636, and they have a long-term S&P target of 3,500 by year end 2025.
Since the start of the year, stocks have been hitting new highs, while bonds have been weaker. The 10-year yield was as high as 2.66 percent last week, the highest since 2014. On Tuesday, it was at 2.61 percent.
The tax bill has helped, leading to strong above-average earnings revisions. ""With a strong pickup in earnings from repatriation and a lower corporate tax rate amid a sales recovery, we expect corporations to accelerate spending across all categories in 2018,"" they wrote.
They see two big potential surprises in corporate spending. They said merger activity could create a record year for mergers and acquisitions, and companies could spend excess cash to pay down their debt to reduce high debt levels as interest rates rise. They also expect debt reduction to be the biggest item that companies spend repatriation proceeds on, as a result of the tax law change requiring corporations to pay U.S. taxes on past profits kept overseas.
Buybacks will be a top area, but there is also a strong case for capex.
The strategists note that the BofA monthly global fund managers' survey shows cash positions dropped to a five-year low of 4.4 percent, a contrarian indicator. They also point out that their own sell-side indicator, which reflects Wall Street strategists' jump in equity allocation recommendations, has risen by 5 points, also a contrarian indicator.
""But no need to panic yet — these indicators are still not at the extreme levels of bullishness that typically coincide with the end of bull markets,"" they wrote. They do expect more volatility, however, and recommend buying high-quality stocks.

Brian Moynihan, Chairman and CEO of Bank of America speaking at the 2018 WEF in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 23rd, 2018.
 The tax overhaul has made the United States a more attractive business destination to overseas companies, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said Tuesday.
 ""What I don't think people see that I've seen so far is not only the U.S. reaction, … but outside of the U.S., the view that the U.S. becomes a more attractive place to manufacture and drive to,"" Moynihan told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""I think that will help the U.S. economy.""
President Donald Trump signed the tax revamp last month that slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Wall Street largely anticipated the change, sending stocks to record highs in 2017.
 ""As you talk to CEOs outside of the United States, the United States seemingly becomes more attractive. We have a talented workforce,"" Moynihan said. ""We have tremendous energy resources. We have a rule of law around working and employment flexibility, and we have regulatory environment that's swinging back in.""
Moynihan took over as Bank of America's chief executive 2010. Bank of America shares have risen more than 100 percent during his tenure.

The perception that millennials — Americans between the ages of 23 and 37 — lack savvy when it comes to saving for retirement, budgeting and setting up and sticking to a financial plan is showing signs of being outdated, noted the survey, made available exclusively to USA TODAY.
Despite many of these young Americans coming of age a decade ago during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression and despite being saddled with high student loan debt, millennials appear to be getting their financial lives in order and taking money matters more seriously.

 11:39  AM ET Thu,  9 Feb 2017 |  00:50 
 About two of three (63 percent) of millennials surveyed say they ""are saving,"" which is in line with 64 percent of Generation X but shy of 75 percent of Baby Boomers who set money aside.
More importantly, 54 percent of millennials say they have a budget, with nearly three of four (73 percent) saying they stick to the budget each month. And another 57 percent say they have a ""savings goal,"" which is higher than the 42 percent of Gen Xers and Boomers who say they are saving with a goal in mind.
Those better habits are translating into more sizable account balances — and more financial security.
About 60 percent say they ""feel financially secure.""
""Their financial habits have become more disciplined,"" Plepler says. ""They've built it into their lifestyles.""
Aside from saving for an emergency, which 64 percent said was a ""top priority,"" half (49 percent) said saving for retirement and a third (33 percent) said saving to buy a house were their top savings goals.
Other key findings of BofA's millennial survey, however, suggest this young generation still suffers from money-related angst and that there's still room for improvement in their cash-management skills.

 The biggest mistake millennials are making is not buying a home, says financial expert   
 11:07  AM ET Thu,  4 Jan 2018 |  01:06 
 The top financial ""stressors"" of millennials, according to the survey, include:
* Not saving enough (35 percent).
* My career path (24 percent).
* Not planning and saving for retirement (21 percent).
* Not being able to afford a home (20 percent).
* Health costs (19 percent).
* Student loans; spending more than I should; credit-card debt; not having enough to invest; losing my job (17 percent for all).
One potential challenge for millennials saving for retirement is the fact that one in four (26 percent) say they work in the ""gig economy,"" or take on short-term contract work or freelance work. That means they likely don't have access to an employer-sponsored retirement account, such as a 401(k), and, as a result, they have to save on their own.
""These gig workers have to be more intentional about their saving,"" Plepler says. ""The findings of our survey are encouraging, however. Millennials are taking much more proactive steps around saving. But this is an issue we have to monitor.""

 Bank of America customers protest new requirements for free checking   
 3:21  PM ET Tue, 23 Jan 2018 |  00:52 
 Some Bank of America customers are protesting a rule change that makes it harder for consumers with low balances to continue receiving free checking.
This month, the banking giant switched e-banking customers into accounts that require a $12 monthly fee unless they have a direct monthly deposit of $250 or more or maintain a minimum daily balance of at least $1,500.
Arguing that the requirements are beyond the financial reach of many lower-income individuals and families, bank customers have launched a Change.org petition that asks Bank of America to drop the requirements. The petition had drawn more than 46,000 signers as of Tuesday.
 ""Bank of America was known to care for both their high income and low income customers. This is what made Bank of America different,"" wrote Mel San, who launched the petition. ""I urge you to let Bank of America realize that this is unfair to their customers that have been loyal to them for years.""

The protest comes as some U.S. banks examine appropriate charges for basic checking accounts that run up maintenance costs but also provide a source of income through overdraft fees.
Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America, the nation's largest bank by deposits, stopped offering the basic, e-banking accounts to new customers in 2013 and started switching existing customers to regular checking accounts more recently. The bank said the e-banking accounts were not designed to target lower-income customers.
A small segment of the bank's customers had remained in the e-banking accounts until recent weeks, drawn in part by the knowledge they would only face an $8.95 monthly fee if they used bank tellers for routine transactions.
According to the bank, students under age 24 are eligible for an exemption that would enable them to continue their e-banking accounts. But others are being switched to regular accounts. The bank said it does not break out numbers of customers by specific types of service.
""Our Core Checking account provides full access to all our financial centers, ATMs, mobile and online banking and offers several ways to avoid a monthly fee, including a monthly direct deposit of $250, which equates to $3,000 annually,"" said Betty Riess, a Bank of America spokeswoman. ""This is one of the lowest qualifiers in the industry and a great value.""
During a conference call with Wall Street analysts last week, Paul Donofrio, Bank of America's chief financial officer, said the U.S. banking industry has had little to no increases in deposit rates for traditional banking in recent years.
Asked when that might change as banks face lower income and profits from some other banking services, Donofrio said: ""my guess is we're getting close to that point.""
""We just don't know, though,"" added Donofrio.""All I can tell you is that we're going to balance our customer needs, and we're going to balance the competitive marketplace with our shareholders' interests and we're going to do the right thing for all the parties.""

BECKY QUICK: RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS WITH OUR FIRST GUEST WHO HAS A BIG STAKE IN ALL THE MAJOR FINANCIAL ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS PAST YEAR. THOSE INCLUDE TAX REFORM, THE U.S. MARKET RALLY AND THE FUTURE OF BANKS IN THE DIGITAL AGE. JOINING US RIGHT NOW IS BANK OF AMERICA CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BRIAN MOYNIHAN. AND BY THE WAY, BANK OF AMERICA WAS THE BEST PERFORMING BANK STOCK IN 2017, IT WAS UP BY 32%. AND BRIAN, WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY.
BRIAN MOYNIHAN: MY PLEASURE TO BE HERE ON A BEAUTIFUL DAY. AS JOE SAID, IT'S REALLY SPECTACULAR.
QUICK: WE GOT LUCKY TODAY. WE DO. BRIAN, YOU JUST CAME OUT WITH EARNINGS. THE NUMBERS WERE BETTER THAN EXPECTED, BUT ONE SLIGHTLY WEAK NUMBER WAS THE TRADING NUMBER. IT'S HIT A LOT OF BANKS BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF VOLATILITY. YOUR TRADING REVENUE DOWN 34% IN FIXED INCOME. FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER, WE HAVEN'T SEEN A WHOLE LOT MORE VOLATILITY, BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH TRADING? CAN YOU GET US UP TO DATE ON THAT?
MOYNIHAN: WELL, THERE'S A SEASONALITY TO TRADING THAT GOES ON AND AS YOU OPEN A NEW YEAR, PEOPLE GET BACK TO WORK AND YOU SEE IT, AND SO IT'S BEEN A BIT STRONGER, BUT THAT HAPPENS EVERY YEAR. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IT THE WAY WE RUN THE TRADING BUSINESS, TOM MONTAG AND TEAM, OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS OUR REVENUES RANGED IN THAT BUSINESS FROM 12.9 TO 13.6 BILLION IN REVENUE, SO IT'S MUCH MORE STABLE THAN PEOPLE THINK. AND IT COMES FROM OUR ABILITY TO CLIENTS AND OUR INVESTOR CLIENTS INTERACT. SO WE'RE NOT RUNNING IT TO SWING FROM THE FENCES. WE'RE RUNNING IT TO GET THOSE SINGLES AND DOUBLES AND THAT TEAM DOES A GREAT JOB.
QUICK: WE JUST TALKED ABOUT TREASURY RATES, HOW THEY'VE BEEN CREEPING UP A LITTLE BIT, THE TWO-YEAR, THE FIVE-YEAR, THE TEN-YEAR. THINGS ARE REALLY STARTING TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT. AND I JUST WONDER WHAT THAT MEANS FOR BANK OF AMERICA, BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR HIGHER RATES FOR A LONG TIME.
MOYNIHAN: WELL, IF THE RATE STRUCTURE MOVING UP REPRESENTS EVEN STRONGER GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY, AND NEXT YEAR THE U.S. ECONOMY PICKS UP A HALF PERCENT TO THREE QUARTERS OF A PERCENT, DEPENDING ON HOW SOME OF THE INITATIVES YOU TALKED ABOUT ROLL THROUGH – THAT'S A GREAT THING. IF THE RATES ARE RISING IN RESPONSE TO THAT. IF THE RATES RISING BECAUSE THERE'S INFLATION OR OTHER THINGS, THAT'S NOT SO GOOD, BUT WE ALL BENEFIT TECHNICALLY 3 BILLION DOLLARS IF THERE'S A BASIS POINT PARALLEL RISE IN THE CURVE FROM YEAR END. 60-70% OF IT IS A SHORT END. THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN TRUE. BUT THE REAL THING WE BENEFIT BY IS THE GENERAL ECONOMY, AND IT'S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND WE PROJECT IT TO GROW 2.7% VERSUS, SAY, AND THIS YEAR, LOW 2s.
QUICK: YOU KNOW, THE IMF JUST RAISED THEIR GLOBAL GROWTH FORECAST TO 3.9%, IT WAS AN INCREASE OF 0.2%, AND THAT WAS BASED ON THE U.S. TAX LAW CHANGES BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S GOING TO HELP THE GLOBAL ECONOMY OVERALL. WE KNOW KIND OF WHAT IT MEANS FOR BANK OF AMERICA, BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE COMPANIES YOU DO BUSINESS WITH? WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS FOR THE BROADER ECONOMY?
MOYNIHAN: I THINK THE KEY FOR TAX REFORM IN THE U.S. FROM A CORPORATE PERSPECTIVE AND A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE WAS A LOWER CORPORATE TAX RATE AND A TERRITORIAL SYSTEM. SO WHAT YOU REMOVE IS SO MANY INCENTIVES TO TRY TO MOVE MONEY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE NATURAL WATERMARK WOULD BE FOR ACTIVITIES. AND SO COMPANIES ARE GOING TO BENEFIT BY THAT. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE MORE MONEY TO INVEST. THAT'S ONE SIDE. AND THE SECOND THING IS THEY WILL BE LESS ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE KNEW WANTS IN NUANCES IN TAX. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH AS YOU TALK TO CEOs OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED STATES SEEMINGLY BECOMES MORE ATTRACTIVE. WE HAVE A TALENT OF WORK FORCE THAT WILL BEAT UNEMPLOMENT SO LOW AS A QUESTION MARK IN TERMS OF HOW MANY WE HAVE, WE HAVE TREMENDOUS ENERGY RESOURCES, WE HAVE A RULE OF LAW AROUND WORKING AND EMPLOYMENT FLEXIBILITY AND WE A REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT'S SWINGING BACK IN. SO WHAT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SEE – WHAT I'VE BEEN PLEASED TO SEE SO FAR IS NOT ONLY U.S. REACTION, WHICH YOU MIGHT EXPECT A LOWER TAX RATE, BUT OUTSIDE THE U.S., THE U.S. BECOMES A MORE ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MANUFACTURE AND DRIVE TO, AND I THINK THAT WILL HELP THE U.S. ECONOMY. WHEN THE U.S. ECONOMY GOES BECAUSE OF SIZE AND THE CONSUMER SIDE OF IT, THAT LIFTS A LOT OF BOATS. SO I THINK THAT WILL BE GOOD OVERALL FOR THE WORLD.
QUICK: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESSES? I KNOW IT'S VERY EARLY DAYS, BUT HAVE YOU SEEN INCREASED DEMAND FOR LOANS OR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE – TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO DO IT?
MOYNIHAN: WE'VE BEEN DOING SORT OF SUCCESSIVE RECORD QUARTERS OF ORIGINATION, SMALL MID SIZE BUSINESSES IT'S BEEN VERY STRONG. I THINK SMALL BUSINESSES TEND -- HAVE LOOKED THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ON POLICY OF BEING A BIT WORKING AGAINST THEM. IF YOU GO BACK TO THE – WE DECIDE THAT POLICY INVOLVED BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS CAUSES THEM TO SLOW DOWN AND RETHINK THE BUSINESS MODELS. WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE REGULATORY MOVE PLUS THE TAX REFORM IS YOU HAVE TAKEN AWAY UNCERTAINTY, SO THEY'LL BE MORE AGGRESSIVE. IT'S ONLY A MONTH SO YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF OVERSTATING IT. BUT IF THEY TELL YOU THEY'LL DO IT, LETS SAY ITS 5%, 10% MORE AGGRESSIVE IN TERMS OF INVESTMENT, THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU TAKE ACROSS OUR 200,000 -- OUR 200,000 SORT OF MID SIZE BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. JUST THINK OF EACH OF THEM BEING SLIGHTLY MORE AGGRESSIVE AND HOW THAT FLYWHEEL KEEPS TURNING AND GENERATING ACTIVITY.
ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE COMPANIES THAT ANNOUNCED – INCLUDING, BY THE WAY, THE PARENT COMPANY OF THIS NETWORK, COMCAST – ANNOUNCING RIGHT AFTER THE TAX REFORM PLAN TO GIVE ONE-TIME BONUSES? WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IS ABOUT?
MOYNIHAN: WE DID IT AS PART OF THE SHARED SUCCESS WITH OUR TEAMMATES. AND SO, WHEN WE THINK ABOUT DRIVING RESPONSIBLE GROWTH AT BANK OF AMERICA, WE THINK ABOUT BEING SUSTAINABLE, WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE FOR TEAMMATES TO WORK IN. SO WHEN THE COMPANY RECEIVES A BENEFIT LIKE THAT, WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SHOW THE TEAMMATES WE SHARED THE SUCCESS WITH. IT'S ONE PART OF WHAT WEVE DONE IN TERMS OF HEALTHCARE BENEFITS THAT WE'VE CHANGED AND LOWERED COSTS FOR LOWER PAID PEOPLE. WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK AROUND IT, SO IT'S ONE COMPONENT OF THAT. BUT I THINK IT WAS A GOOD SIGN THAT, HEY, WE RECEIVED A BENEFIT, YOU SHOULD SHARE IN IT. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO USE THE TAX SAVINGS TO INVEST IN THE COMPANY AND CONTINUE TO DRIVE THINGS.
SORKIN: BUT WAS IT DRIVEN FROM AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE?
MOYNIHAN: IT WAS DRIVEN BY – YOU RECEIVED A BENEFIT AND I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SHARE THAT WITH THE TEAMMATES. AND BELIEVE ME, IF YOU GOT THE E-MAILS THAT I GOT FROM TEAMMATES WHO WERE EXCITED TO GET IT ON CHRISTMAS WEEK IN THEIR PAYROLL IN TIME TO SPEND IT, IT WAS A TREMENDOUS THING.
QUICK: LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE CONSUMER. I KNOW THE CONSUMER WAS VERY STRONG. I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON, THE STRENGTH THAT WAS THERE. BUT I ALSO READ A REPORT YESTERDAY THAT SUGGESTED THAT CONSUMER BAD DEBT WAS UP BY 20% IN THE CREDIT CARDS FOR FOUR MAJOR BANKS, INCLUDING YOURS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? SHOULD WE BE WORRIED ABOUT IT?
MOYNIHAN: LET'S THINK ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. THE SPENDING, IF YOU THINK FROM 15 TO 16 AND 16 TO 17, FOR THE YEAR, THE SPENDING ON DEBIT, CREDIT CARDS, CHECKS WRITTEN, CASH, EVERYTHING AT BANK OF AMERICA WAS UP 3% 15 TO 16, WAS UP 6%, 16 TO 17. AND THINK OF THAT DIFFERENCE AS BEING ACROSS $2.6 TRILLION OF SPENDING, AND THAT IS A LOT OF THINGS, SO CONSUMERS ARE OUT SPENDING. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, YOU HEAR ABOUT RETAIL SALES AND STUFF. THERE'S A LOT OF SPENDING ON EXPERIENCES, AND EATING, TRAVELING AND STUFF THAT'S PICKED UP. SO THE SPENDING IS VERY GOOD. ON THE CREDIT CARD PICK UP, WE'RE AT A LOW BASE. SO, WE ALWAYS HAVE A BIT OF A PICK UP IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, BUT WE WENT FROM, I DON'T KNOW, 2.6 TO 2.8 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THESE ARE NUMBERS – WE USED TO UNDERWRITE THE 5.5% IN GOOD TIMES OF LOSSES. WE'RE NOW IN GOOD TIMES WE'RE EXPERIENCING HALF THAT. UNDER STRESS WE ONLY GET TO THAT LEVEL. SO THE CONSERVATIVES IN US AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE INDUSTRY ON UNDERWRITING WILL HOLD THIS IN CHECK. AND YOU KNOW, IT SHOULD. AND SO I THINK THE INCREASE OFF A DEBT COUNT BALANCE LEVEL AND IS EXPECTED. AND WE'LL SEE THAT TURN BACK DOWN AS WE GET THROUGH SEASONALITY. AND ON TOP OF THAT AS YOU CONTINUE TO GROW RECEIVABLES, YOU'LL SEE THAT IN GOOD SHAPE. AND SO, CONSUMER CREDIT IS IN GOOD SHAPE IN THE UNITED STATES.
JOE KERNEN: YOU HAVE CLOSED A LOT OF BRANCHES, BRIAN. MINE GOT CLOSED. THAT'S OKAY. IT'S ALRIGHT. BUT IN A LOT OF AREAS—
MOYNIHAN: A TECHNOLOGY GIANT LIKE YOU, PROBABLY--
KERNEN: YES. YES. EXACTLY. I NEVER USE CASH. I USE – WHAT DO I USE?
SORKIN: BITCOIN.
KERNEN: VENMO OR SOMETHING?
MOYNIHAN: YOU OUGHT TO BE USING ZELL.
KERNEN: MY VENMO, THROUGH MY PAYPAL OR SOMETHING. NO BUT, THAT'S A CHANGE IN STRATEGY, ISN'T IT? I MEAN, BANK OF AMERICA, THERE SHOULD BE ONE ON EVERY CORNER. IT SHOULD BE LIKE STARBUCKS. BANK OF STARBUCKS.
MOYNIHAN: THE THING IS, AS MUCH AS -- AT THE PEAK WE HAD 6,100 BRANCHES AND WE SOLD ABOUT 500 OR 700 TO SMALLER BANKS THAT COULD GET THE CONSOLIDATION BENEFITS, DO THINGS, AND WE CLOSED SOME. BUT IT WAS ALL BASED ON CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR AND CUSTOMER FLOWS. BUT THE REALITY IS IN THAT TIME, LAST YEAR WE REHABBED 300 OR 400 BRANCHES, WE BUILT ABOUT 50 OR 100 NEW. OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, IT'LL BE ABOUT 300 OR 400 NEW. WE'LL GO INTO CITIES LIKE MINNEAPOLIS AND DENVER THAT WE'VE NEVER BEEN IN. WE'VE GONE FROM 150th MARKET POSITION TO 8th IN THOSE CITIES ALREADY JUST STARTING OFF. AND SO WE'RE BRINGING OUR SERVICES AS AND CAPABILITIES. THERE'S SEVEN OR EIGHT LARGE CITIES IN THE TOP 50 U.S. THAT WE'RE NOT IN. WE'LL BE BUILDING BRANCHES. SO IT'S A VERY COMPLEX DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY THAT – WITH A CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR, IF I WERE A RETAILER YOU'D BE TELLING ME, ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN TERMS OF ONLINE SALES?"" WELL WE GOT ONLINE 10 YEARS AGO. AND SO WE'VE SEEN THE CHANGE IN CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR AND IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING, EVERY WAY FOR CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE A MILLION PEOPLE COME TO BRANCHES EVERY DAY. WE HAVE TO SERVE THAT WELL. WE HAVE 35 MILLION DIGITAL CUSTOMERS—
KERNEN: THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE. ALL SERVED BY ONE TELLER?
MOYNIHAN: 60,000 TEAMMATES.
KERNEN: STILL?
MOYNIHAN: IN THE RETAIL SYSTEM. YEAH.
KERNEN: OH OK. ONE TELLER LEFT, THOUGH. THANK YOU, BRIAN.
QUICK: IT'S GREAT HAVING YOU HERE. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.
MOYNIHAN: THANK YOU. ENJOY YOUR DAVOS GUYS.

88,2018-01-24,Bank of America CEO: People with this skill will be successful in the future job market  ,"In a world and market where the only constant is change, there's one skill that you will need to get an edge in the coming decades, says Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.
 ""The ability of people to be successful in the future job market is going to come down to the ability to absorb tremendous amounts of information,"" Moynihan tells CNBC Make It at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week.
You'll not only need to take in massive amounts of data, you'll need ""to be able to process it and think through it and intellectually assess it"" to determine what's important, he says.
 Of course, finding the signal in the noise is only half the battle. To be truly successful, you'll have to then incite your teammates and customers to take action on it, says Moynihan.
""It's that last piece that a lot of people often miss,"" he adds. ""The smartest answer doesn't do you any good unless you get your teammates to actually do it or you get your customers to respond to it.""

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 This is a lesson Moynihan takes to heart as a leader of more than 200,000 employees and a company with a market cap of over $300 billion.
""I think the habit of being a voracious reader and absorber of information is what I attribute to helping me every day,"" he says. ""And learning from smart people, who are much smarter and more capable than I am.""
On his reading list are lots of newspapers, some historical books to learn mistakes of the past, and once in awhile novels for fun.
""I just read one called 'Exit West' [by Mohsin Hamid] on migration,"" he says. ""It gives you a sense of what it would feel like to do that. And those are important to read.""
Business books can be a good resource, though ""by the time things get written in business books, sometimes they're a little bit stale,"" he notes. The important thing is just to take in as much knowledge as you can and work to decipher it and apply it.
""Always keep learning, keep reading, keep researching, keep trying things out. Never stop learning,"" Moynihan says. ""When you go through college you learn so much. After that you'll start to deteriorate if you don't keep current. So read and absorb information.""

A woman touches an ATM machine for digital currency Bitcoin in Hong Kong on December 18, 2017.
 Friction is increasing between some credit card companies and customers who want to use the cards to buy cryptocurrencies. 
 Bank of America and Citigroup are reviewing policies that allow customers to buy bitcoin with credit cards. The reviews follow news about two weeks ago that Capital One Financial has decided to prohibit cryptocurrency purchases.
 CapOneTweet
 Toronto-Dominion Bank subsidiary TD Bank also confirmed to CNBC that some bitcoin transactions aren't being processed, as a result of security measures. Discover Financial Services has effectively prohibited cryptocurrency purchases with its credit cards since 2015.
The Wall Street Journal first reported news of Bank of America's cryptocurrency review Thursday. 
Money laundering appears to be a factor in the financial firms' concerns about dealing with cryptocurrencies. Discover CEO David Nelms said in a Bloomberg report Wednesday that financing purchases of cryptocurrencies creates headaches for banks that are required to monitor transactions for money laundering.
Earlier this month, Visa also ended its relationship with cryptocurrency card company WaveCrest, which allows people to convert their cryptocurrencies into cash loaded onto a prepaid card.
J.P. Morgan Chase is still allowing customers to buy cryptocurrencies with their Chase credit cards, the bank told CNBC. Chase did not respond to a question about potential changes to that policy.

90,2018-01-26,An indicator with a perfect track record just sent a 'powerful' sell signal  ,"show chapters
 How good is too good for the rally?   
 11:45  AM ET Fri, 26 Jan 2018 |  02:32 
 The relentless gush of cash into the stock market is sending a powerful ""sell"" signal, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch gauge that has been a reliable indicator in the past.
 Investors poured $33.2 billion into stock-based funds through the week ended Wednesday, BofAML said in a report. That's a record both for total flows and as well as for active funds, which alone pulled in $12.2 billion.
By comparison, equity funds across all classes took in a net $278 billion for all of 2017, according to Morningstar, meaning that last week alone equated to 12 percent of flows for the entire previous year.
 The week continued a trend that has seen money rush into stocks as major averages climb to new records. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 7 percent year to date.
While the inflows have helped push the market higher, they also can be seen as a contrary indicator when they flash signs of excess. BofAML uses a proprietary ""Bull & Bear"" indicator that gauges when inflows or outflows point to investors moving too far to either side.
The current reading on the indicator of 7.9 is the most bullish since a reading above 8 in March 2013 — a sell signal. Michael Hartnett, BofAML's chief investment strategist, said the Bull & Bear indicator has shown 11 previous sell signals since the firm started tracking it in 2002 and has been correct each time.
In the near term, around February and March, that suggests a technical pullback for the S&P 500 to 2,686, which would represent a drop of close to 6 percent, Hartnett said.
The enthusiasm has not been unique to the U.S., whose equity markets brought in $7 billion of fresh cash.
Emerging markets attracted $8.1 billion in new flows, Europe brought in $4.6 billion and Japan saw $3.4 billion. That comes as 98 percent of global markets are trading above their 50- and 200-day moving averages, both classic signs of overbought markets.
 FWIW, the Dow is the most overbought since ... 1904 (not a typo)
 Stock-based funds overall have brought in just shy of $77 billion in 2018, with the lion's share of $59.2 billion going to passively focused exchange-traded funds.
However, investors continue to hedge, giving about $32 billion to bonds, while last week's $1.5 billion flow into gold funds was the highest in 50 weeks.

 Firm grip on bull market says Deutsche's David Bianco   
 7:39  AM ET Fri,  2 Feb 2018 |  03:49 
 The frantic dash into stocks has hit a boiling point, causing a reliable indicator from Bank of America Merrill Lynch to flash a sell signal Friday.
 High levels of investor enthusiasm can be a bad thing when it comes to financial markets, as too much money can push valuations out of whack. BofAML's historically reliable indicator is pointing to just such a period.
The firm's strategists say overheated bullishness tripped its ""sell"" indicator Tuesday, in the early stages of what has been a rough week. When all is said and done, technical indicators point to a level of 2,686 on the S&P 500, which would represent a nearly 5 percent drop from Thursday's closing level, BofAML said in a note to clients.
 This is the 12th time that the ""Bull & Bear"" indicator has indicated a ""sell"" position dating to 2002, and each time has been accurate, the firm said in a note last week. The average peak-to-trough return is a drop of 12 percent.
That's the bad news. 
The firm, however, retains a constructive view on the market, with technical strategists telling clients earlier in the week that the fast start in January bodes well for the rest of the year. Based on the 5.6 percent gain for the first month of the year, history suggests the S&P 500 is likely on its way to 3,000 by the end of 2018 and even could hit 3,100, respective gains of 6.3 percent and 9.9 percent.

 What's triggering the near-term concern, though, is another surge in cash both to mutual and exchange-traded funds.
Stock-focused funds took in another $25.7 billion for the week ended Wednesday. ETFs saw the bulk with $22.4 billion, but active mutual funds again saw positive inflows, at $3.4 billion. Together, the funds have seen investors pour in $102.7 billion already in 2018.
Despite the continued run into equities, bond funds also saw another positive week, taking in $5.7 billion for a year-to-date tally of $37.7 billion.
The trends are all part of a big start to the year for ETFs, which took in a record $79 billion in January, including $42 billion to U.S. stock funds, according to Citigroup.
Stocks, however, are in a rut, with the Dow industrials seeing losses cross 2 percent for the week in early Friday trading. The index was off more than 300 points in the first half-hour of trading Friday.
Despite the pullback, it's been a great run for the market as the Dow has gained more than 31 percent over the past year.
Such pullbacks aren't unusual in a hot market, and many leading market strategists expect 2018 to be a volatile period overall.
Investors, thus, have been spreading money around. Within the big surge to stock funds, emerging markets took in $7.8 billion and Japan attracted $2.4 billion in fresh money, though the U.S. continued to lead with $11.1 billion, the biggest influx in 33 weeks, according to BofAML.
In style, large-caps dominated with $13.2 billion. Sectorwise, tech and financials took in $1.3 billion apiece.

Jamie Dimon speaking at the 2017 Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Sept. 12, 2017.
 J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup said Friday they are no longer allowing customers to buy cryptocurrencies using credit cards. 
 ""At this time, we are not processing cryptocurrency purchases using credit cards, due to the volatility and risk involved,"" a J.P. Morgan Chase spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. ""We will review the issue as the market evolves."" 
The news came as bitcoin has more than halved in value from an all-time high above $19,000 hit in mid-December. The high-flying digital currency had rallied 2,000 percent in just 12 months to reach that record. But bitcoin has tumbled in the last few weeks, briefly falling below $8,000 Friday for the first time since late November. 
 Other cryptocurrencies have also fallen in the last few weeks after soaring, sometimes even far more than bitcoin, last year. 
A Bank of America spokesperson also said in an email that the bank has decided to decline credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies.
Citigroup said in a statement that it has ""made the decision to no longer permit credit card purchases of cryptocurrency. We will continue to review our policy as this market evolves.""
Just last week, Chase said it was allowing customers to buy cryptocurrencies with its credit cards, while Bank of America and Citigroup said they were reviewing policies that allow customers to buy bitcoin with credit cards.
Earlier in January, Capital One Financial said it has decided to ban cryptocurrency purchases with its cards. Discover Financial Services has effectively prohibited cryptocurrency purchases with its credit cards since 2015.
Several major retail-facing companies have made it easier for consumers to buy bitcoin in the last few months. 
On Wednesday, Jack Dorsey's payments company Square announced that most users of its Cash app can now trade bitcoin. Meanwhile, stock trading app Robinhood is rolling out bitcoin and ethereum trading this month in five states.
Coinbase, the leading U.S. marketplace for buying major cryptocurrencies, announced in mid-October it was rolling out instant purchases of up to $25,000 worth of bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin from U.S. bank accounts.

Tim Sloan, president and chief executive officer of Wells Fargo & Co.
 While many of its peers are giving up on Wells Fargo, Bank of America Merrill Lynch still recommends the embattled bank.
 The Federal Reserve said Friday it is restricting Wells Fargo's size in response to ""widespread consumer abuses."" The government is prohibiting the bank from growing any larger than its total assets as of the end of 2017 until ""sufficient improvements"" are made.
Wells Fargo shares declined 9.2 percent Monday. At least five Wall Street investment banks downgraded the shares following the news.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating for Wells Fargo shares, saying the dramatic drop in its shares after the Fed's action is an overreaction.
""We dug deeply into earnings drivers at WFC, between now and 2020. And, while we expect shares to be weak near term, we conclude that EPS cuts of 2-3% are less than the implied after-market decline of 6%,"" analyst Erika Najarian wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""We would view any potential weakness in the shares as a particularly attractive buying opportunity.""
Najarian slightly lowered her price target for Wells Fargo shares to $69 from $70. The new target is 8 percent higher than Friday's closing price.
In 2016 Wells Fargo admitted that employees, facing pressure to meet sales goals, enrolled customers in products without their knowledge, affecting as many as 3.5 million accounts. Last year, it revealed that thousands of customers had been charged for car insurance they did not need. The bank replaced its CEO and remade its board and will name another four new board members this year.
The analyst said Wells Fargo's estimate on the potential negative impact to net profits from the asset restriction is $300 million to $400 million, or roughly 2 percent of the 2018 earnings per share consensus for the bank.
She said the bank will be able to reorient its asset portfolios to maximize its financial results.
""If there is any silver lining for shareholders, it is that the order forces WFC to optimize its balance sheet,"" she wrote. ""We show how WFC can stay under the asset cap and still grow loans and spread revenue, by running off low-value, high cost deposits and shifting excess cash and other low-yielding cash flow into Ginnie Mae securities — without compromising liquidity needs.""
Nearly 60 percent of Wall Street does not have buy ratings for Wells Fargo shares, according to FactSet.

 });According to a new Bank of America survey, 16 percent of millennials — which BoA defined as those between age 23 and 37 — now have $100,000 or more in savings.
 That's pretty good, considering that by age 30, you should aim to have the equivalent of your annual salary saved. The median earnings for Americans between 25 and 34 years old is $40,352, meaning the 16 percent with $100,000 in savings are well ahead of schedule.
How much should you have stashed away at other ages?
 While the amount you need in savings is highly personal, and specific dollar amounts can be arbitrary, money expert at Intuit Kimmie Greene has a simple formula to help you figure out if you're setting aside enough money.
In your 20s: Aim to save 25 percent of your overall gross pay, Greene tells CNBC Make It. ""That 25 percent is the combination of 401(k) withholdings, matching funds from your employer and any cash savings that you have,"" she notes. ""It can also include debt repayment.

 By age 30: Have the equivalent of your annual salary saved, Greene says. If you earn $50,000 a year, aim to have $50,000 in savings when you hit 30.
Again, this includes any retirement-account contributions, matching funds from your company, cash savings or money you have invested elsewhere, like in index funds or with robo-advisers.
By age 35: Have twice your annual salary saved.
By age 40: Have three times your annual salary saved.
By age 45: Have four times your annual salary saved.

 The most important things to do with your money before 30

 By age 50: Have five times your annual salary saved.
By age 55: Have six times your annual salary saved.
By age 60: Have seven times your annual salary saved.
By age 65: Have eight times your annual salary saved.
Greene's timeline is similar to the one recommended by retirement-plan provider Fidelity Investments, which says a good rule of thumb is to have the equivalent of your salary saved by age 30 and to have 10 times your final salary in savings if you want to retire by age 67.
""While this can sound super daunting today, if you're putting that money to work starting in your 20s, it's not as difficult as it sounds,"" says Greene.
She also notes that ""life is anything but linear"" and it's impossible to follow this formula to a tee. You may have to adjust accordingly and save more or less in any given year, depending on major life events, such as having a kid or buying a home.
At the end of the day, the sooner you start saving — for retirement or any other major purchases you hope will be in your future — the better off you'll be.

 Apple shares will thrive even under a difficult stock market: Bank of America   
 1:01  PM ET Thu,  8 Feb 2018 |  01:00 
 Apple shares will thrive even under a difficult stock market, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating on Apple shares, citing the company's fortress balance sheet.
Apple is ""a name to own in volatile market conditions,"" analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients Thursday entitled ""Attractive in volatile markets, cash cushion like none other.""
 ""In times of market turmoil, we turn to large cap stocks with low leverage, high cash balance, and attractive valuation. Apple offers all this as well as opportunities for future growth. Apple's large cash balance offers the opportunity to expand into new markets,"" he added.
Mohan reaffirmed his $220 price target for Apple shares, representing 38 percent upside to Wednesday's close. The $220 forecast represents a $1.1 trillion market valuation for the company.
The analyst predicts Apple will raise its dividend by 10 percent this year. Mohan forecasts the smartphone maker will be able to generate $50 billion to $60 billion in free cash flow annually for the next two years. He expects the company will announce a new share buyback program in April.
Mohan downplayed investors' recent concerns over slowing iPhone demand.
""While iPhone X sales may be lower than the Street had predicted (our estimates were lower) we view low single digit unit growth and mix adjusted ASP (average selling price) growth into 2019, with upside to gross margins,"" he wrote. ""In addition, Services remain a key growth driver in future years.""
The firm's note comes after the market's volatility rose this past week. A stronger-than-expected jobs report and wage number on Friday sent interest rates higher, sparking a 6 percent sell-off in the S&P 500 over two trading sessions.
Apple shares declined 2.8 percent Thursday.
