 ACA's biggest problem is using balance sheet of private health care: CEO   
 7:55  AM ET Fri, 24 March 2017 |  01:25 
 The U.S. government has a moral obligation to make certain everyone has access to health-care services, former Aetna Chairman and CEO Ron Williams said Friday.
 Williams said he also believes there is a role for individual responsibility in the health-care delivery system.
""We confuse insurance with our moral obligation to provide health-care services to people,""  Williams said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""And what we try to do is finance our moral obligation through the insurance system, which punishes the people who are fiscally responsible to buy insurance."" 
 The former Aetna CEO's comments came ahead of a House vote on a bill backed by President Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.
The vote was postponed Thursday after Republican leaders failed to rally enough support to pass the bill because of a rebellion by the conservative Freedom Caucus and moderate Republicans. Trump has demanded that the House approve the plan as is Friday or leave Obamacare in place.
When asked about solutions to the United States' health-care problems, Williams said a single-payer system in which the government would pay for health care would be the ""single"" worst answer.
""Having no choice doesn't result in innovation and performance improvement,"" he said. ""The biggest innovation in the delivery and design and care delivery have come from the large national employers who have substantial populations of employees, who are innovative and give their employees access to these management programs.""

 Iowa's Obamacare market gets hit a second time as Aetna says it will drop in 2018   
 9:54  AM ET Fri,  7 April 2017 |  00:40 
 A second big shoe just dropped on Iowa's Obamacare marketplace.
 Three days after Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield said it would not sell new individual health insurance plans in Iowa in 2018, Aetna on Thursday said it also will not offer new Obamacare plans next year, citing ""financial risk.""
The moves leave Iowa with just two other insurers that, as of now, sell Obamacare plans in the state. 
 A third Iowa insurer, Medica, told CNBC is has not yet decided whether to continue selling plans there next year. Medica is the only company to offer individual plans in all of the state's counties. The fourth insurer, Gundersen Health Plan, said that its current plan is to participate in the Obamacare marketplace in Iowa.
Aetna said it is ""still evaluating"" if it will sell Obamacare plans in the three other remaining states where it currently does so. 
Aetna covers about 30,000 people in Iowa who buy plans through the federal Obamacare exchange, HealthCare.gov, according industry sources.
Slightly fewer than 52,000 Iowans signed up for coverage on HealthCare.gov during open enrollment for 2017.
Wellmark covers about 21,000 people through Obamacare plans. But a number of them bought those plans outside of the federal exchange.
Aetna spokesman T.J. Crawford said, ""Earlier today we informed the appropriate federal and state regulators that Aetna will not participate in the Iowa individual public exchange for 2018 as a result of financial risk and an uncertain outlook for the marketplace.""
""We are still evaluating Aetna's 2018 individual product presence in our remaining states,"" Crawford said.
The remaining states are Virginia, Nebraska and Delaware.
The situation in Iowa is mirrored in a number of other states where insurers are seriously considering whether to exit Obamacare marketplaces.
Some insurers are worried about remaining in markets where they have been unable to make money as a result of too many customers with high health needs, and not enough health customers to offset their costs. Wellmark blamed its departure from Iowa's Obamacare market on $90 million in loss over three years.
Insurers also are worried about the future of Obamacare, particularly because Republican leaders in Congress have been unable, as of yet, to pass replacement legislation for the health-care law.
Wellmark CEO John Forsyth earlier this week said, ""Finding solutions to stabilize this market is in the best interest of all Iowans, including providers of health care and insurance carriers.""
""No one really benefits from rising costs,"" he continued. ""While there are many potential solutions, the timing and relative impact of those solutions is currently unclear. This makes it difficult to establish plans for 2018.""
Wellmark and Aetna's departures were announced about a month before insurers in Iowa have to start submitting their proposed premium rates for 2018.
About one-third of the counties in the United States this year are served by just a single Obamacare insurer.
Health-care advocates have worried about markets that currently have just one insurer potentially being left with no insurer in 2018, due the uncertainty in Washington. Humana's announcement that it was leaving the Obamacare exchanges in 2018 now leaves Knoxville, Tennessee with the prospect of no Obamacare insurers next year.
But Iowa, which had four insurers on HealthCare.gov in 2017, was not one of the states that analysts had been eyeing for a major market disruption.
""Iowa would not have been on our radar of states where they were at risk, necessarily. But then you have to two companies leave within a space of a couple of days, and suddenly it is at risk,"" said Cynthia Cox, associate director at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
""I think this underscores how much the political uncertainty can cause markets that were otherwise appearing to be stable, to become at risk almost overnight,"" Cox said.
The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is controlled by Republicans, put out a press release on the heels of Aetna's announcement that noted Wellmark's earlier departure as well.
""The insurer exodus continues [its] drip-drip-drip effect on patients, leaving them guessing on the future of the marketplace,"" the release said. ""This year, Iowans had four insurers offering plans on the individual market. Next year they will have just one state-wide insurer. Patients deserve better – a health care system that puts them first and delivers on being more affordable and accessible.""
Larry Bussey, a spokesman for Medica, when asked what that insurer planned to do in light of Aetna's decision, said, ""At this point we're just looking at the situation and evaluating what our options are, and really looking at what we're going to do.""
Medica covers about 14,000 people in Iowa who buy plans though HealthCare.gov.
CNBC has reached out to comment from the fourth Obamacare insurer in Iowa, Gunderson.
In a note Thursday, Evercore ISI said that ""the decline in Iowa's exchange sign-ups this year was a bit larger (-6.4 percent) than the U.S. overall (-3.7 percent), and it also saw a bigger move towards higher-cost older members.""
""But clearly the exit of 2 of 4 carriers from Iowa now raises the uncertainty for exchanges in general in 2018,"" Evercore ISI said.

 Aetna CEO: Our presence on Obamacare exchanges will be smaller   
 8:12  PM ET Tue,  2 May 2017 |  04:24 
 Aetna's CEO Mark Bertolini doesn't want to charge some people more for Obamacare — but he does want the government to step up and fund the program ""appropriately.""
 Bertolini on Tuesday rejected a suggestion that Republican proposals to allow insurers to charge people with pre-existing health conditions more for Obamacare plans could prompt Aetna to return in force to individual plan marketplaces.
Instead, Bertolini said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell,"" the federal government should guarantee financial support for insurers who participate in the program, which in turn could maintain and expand health coverage for many people.
 Specifically, Bertolini said the government should fund programs that protect insurers financially when they have high-cost patients and that lower out-of-pocket health expenses for low-income customers.
""I don't think it's a matter of raising premiums on people with pre-existing conditions,"" said Bertolini, whose company went from selling Obamacare plans in 15 states last year to selling them in just four this year after citing big financial losses on individual health plans.
""I think people with pre-existing conditions, people under the age of 26, should get insurance. Anybody who applies should get insurance,"" he said. 
""I think the biggest program with the [Affordable Care Act] is how it is funded,"" Bertolini said. ""If it were funded correctly, all these people could get coverage.""
""If it's just funded on the premium basis without reinsurance, if cost-sharing reductions don't show up after September, none of it works,"" he said.
Most Obamacare customers receive subsidies that lower the cost, often sharply, of their monthly premiums below retail prices, because they have low or moderate incomes.
Reinsurance is the subsidization by the government of insurers who find themselves covering customers with high health costs.  Obamacare's reinsurance program ran only from 2014 through 2016, and the Republican-controlled Congress has barred the government from paying insurers the entire amount they are owed for another Obamacare cost-reduction program, known as risk corridors.
Cost-sharing reductions are subsidies offered to low-income Obamacare customers that reduce how much they have to pay in copayments, coinsurance and deductibles when they obtain health services. Insurers are responsible for issuing those reductions but then are supposed to be reimbursed for their cost by the federal government.
The Trump administration has given conflicting signals about whether it will continue to authorize the payments of CSRs to insurers, and House Republican leaders have proposed ending CSRs permanently as part of their Obamacare replacement bill. 
Bertolini, talking about those Obamacare subsidies on Tuesday, said there is ""a set of interconnected financial relationships that need to exist in order to support a market like this.""
""Currently, as structured,"" Bertolini said, even if Republicans agree to continue to fund the cost-sharing reduction program through September, it ""is not enough to get people engaged in the exchanges again.""
Aetna announced several weeks ago that it would not sell individual health plans on Iowa's Obamacare market in 2018.
Bertolini said Tuesday the company is evaluating which, if any, of the remaining three states — Delaware, Nebraska and Virginia — it will remain in next year for Obamacare plans.
""We expect to lose around $200 million, $220 million this year on the exchanges, with only a quarter of the membership we had last year,"" Bertolini said. ""So we're evaluating the markets as we speak.""
""We will be notifying some other states shortly. We only have four states remaining, so our presence will be smaller than it is this year.""

 Aetna won't offer individual Obamacare plans in Virginia   
 3:31  PM ET Wed,  3 May 2017 |  01:14 
 Giant insurer Aetna on Wednesday continued an ongoing retreat from the Obamacare business, announcing it will not sell such health plans in Virginia next year because of expected financial losses.
 Aetna left open the question of whether it will sell individual health plans anywhere next year.
The insurer, which last month announced it would exit Iowa's Obamacare market in 2018, sells individual plans in just two other states this year: Delaware and Nebraska.
 ""Despite significantly reducing our exchange footprint, our individual commercial products could potentially lose more than $200 million in 2017,"" said Aetna spokesman T.J. Crawford in an email.
""Based on that financial risk, and growing uncertainty in the marketplace, we will not offer on- or off-exchange individual plans in Virginia for 2018.""
""We will communicate decisions on our remaining states as appropriate,"" Crawford said.
The email contains a graphic image depicting Aetna's approximate pre-tax losses on Obamacare plans since they began being sold in 2014. They go from about $100 million that year, up to $130 million in 2015, and about $450 million last year.
 The pull-out of Virginia, Iowa, and potentially the other two states will not affect customers covered by Aetna through either their employer, or through Medicaid and Medicare Advantage plans.
The move only relates to individual plans sold on and off of the federal Obamacare exchange HealthCare.gov.
Aetna sells health plans in 50 of Virginia's 95 counties, according to data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. In 24 counties where it operates, there is just one other insurer selling Obamacare plans: Anthem, under the brand name HealthKeepers.
Anthem has already filed paperwork related to potentially selling plans in 2018 in Virginia.
However, Anthem and other insurers have warned that if they are not guaranteed federal subsidies for reducing out-of-pocket health costs for low-income customers, they may have to either raise rates for 2018 plans, or not sell them altogether.
A spokesman for Virginia's insurance commissioner declined to comment when asked about Aetna's decision.
Aetna last year sold individual Obamacare plans in 15 states. But it retreated to just four states in 2017 because of losses from the plans.
Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini on Tuesday had told CNBC's ""Closing Bell,"" that given the expected losses for 2017, ""we're evaluating the markets as we speak.""
""We will be notifying some other states shortly. We only have four states remaining, so our presence will be smaller than it is this year,"" Bertolini said that day.
Aetna on Tuesday reported earnings for its overall business that were better than had been expected by analysts.
The insurer reported a net loss of $381 million, or $1.11 per share, in the first quarter of 2017, ending March 31. The company had a profit of $737 million, or $2.08 per share, in the same quarter a year earlier.
Aetna said the quarter's loss was due mainly to costs linked to the end of a merger agreement with Humana.

Mark Bertolini
 The chief executive of one of the country's largest health insurance companies says he is open to having a single-payer debate.
""Single-payer, I think we should have that debate as a nation,"" Aetna chief executive Mark Bertolini said Thursday.
Bertolini spoke to a private meeting where Aetna employees could ask questions of their chief executive. A partial video of his remarks provided to Vox includes Bertolini responding to a question about single-payer health care.
 More from Vox: Trump is threatening to release secret Comey ""tapes"" and cancel press briefings Impeachment of the president, explainedThe case for and against a universal basic income in the United States
""In the news media, it is reporting that the Republican health plan is paving the way to a single-payer system,"" an Aetna employee asks Bertolini. ""What are your thoughts on that, and how would it impact Aetna?""
This was his response:
 Single-payer, I think we should have that debate as a nation. But let me remind everybody that Aetna was the first financial intermediary for Medicare. We cut the first check for Medicare in 1965 to Hartford Hospital for $517.57. The government doesn't administer anything. the first thing they've ever tried to administer in social programs was the ACA, and that didn't go so well. So the industry has always been the back room for government. If the government wants to pay all the bills, and employers want to stop offering coverage, and we can be there in a public private partnership to do the work we do today with Medicare, and with Medicaid at every state level, we run the Medicaid programs for them, then let's have that conversation. But if we want to turn it all over to the government to run, is the government really the right place to run all this stuff? And that's the debate that needs to be had. They could finance it, and if there is one financer, and you could call that single-payer. ... We're going to pay for it one way or another. What we have to do is we have to get the costs right. We have to get people healthy. It's not about who is paying the bill. It's about what we're doing to get the costs down. The Democrats are now saying that with the new Republican bill, wait there is nothing in here about getting costs down. That's the point. And so that's the place we're headed as a company. It's not just about paying the bills. 
What Bertolini seems open to is a version of single-payer where the federal government would contract out certain functions private companies, such as Aetna. These insurers would, in his own words, become a ""back room for government.""
Aetna spokesperson T.J. Crawford said that Bertolini was not ""advocating"" for a single-payer system.
""Mark was certainly not advocating for a single-payer system, but instead encouraging debate while pointing out that public-private partnerships have been the backbone of the more successful government health care programs (examples include administering Medicare Advantage or Medicaid managed care),"" he said in an emailed statement. ""In other words, partnering works when done the right way.""

 Mark Bertolini spoke out for the first time about the reason he's decided to move Aetna's headquarters out of Hartford, Connecticut, where the company was founded more than 160 years ago.
 ""We haven't told anybody where yet, but it will be sort of an investment in attracting different kinds of people into our organization,"" said Bertolini on CNBC Europe's ""Street Signs,"" adding ""as we have to move away from being just an insurance company to actually impacting the underlying health of the population, that requires younger people, technologists, innovation.""
Last month, the health insurer confirmed it was in negotiations with several cities and indicated it would announce a decision early this summer. Aetna currently has about 6,000 employees in Connecticut, with the majority based in the Hartford area, where its headquarters occupies a 1.7 million-square-foot campus.
 A source familiar with the situation said that Boston and New York are the leading contenders for the new headquarters.
A spokesperson for the city of Boston's economic development office declined to comment on Bertolini's statements. New York economic development officials did not reply to inquiries.
Bertolini would only say the company has tried to expand its footprint to communities where young talented people want to live.
""We've opened up a technology center in Massachusetts, and we'll continue to add people there. We do have a presence in Silicon Valley, in Denver, in Salt Lake, in ... Austin, Texas,"" he said. ""Places where people want to hang out.""
Aetna's departure from Connecticut would mark the state's second loss of a major Fortune 500 firm. General Electric relocated its headquarters from Fairfield, Connecticut, to Boston in 2016.

 Aetna and Molina Health's latest results are a stark reminder that government health programs continue to be a source of profitable growth for health insurers, if managed well, as long as you're not talking about the Obamacare exchange market.
 ""Operating results in our government business remain robust, with government premiums representing more than half of total Health Care premiums,"" said Mark Bertolini, Aetna chairman and CEO, on the company's earnings conference call.
Aetna reported second-quarter earnings of $3.60 per share, well above analyst estimates, on $15.5 billion in revenues. Profits rose nearly than 50 percent from a year ago, helped by increased Medicare membership, and lower exposure to money-losing Obamacare plan costs, after exiting all but four state exchanges for 2017.
 The company raised its 2017 full-year outlook to between $9.45 to $9.55 per share, from $8.80 to $9.00 per share, but also cautioned that it will be investing more over the next year in order to expand its Medicare business, after its two-year effort to acquire rival Humana was blocked.
""Our strong performance through the first half of 2017 has provided us the flexibility to continue to make these investments and still deliver strong financial results,"" said Bertolini.

 Aetna and Molina Health had both been bullish on the Obamacare market four year ago, but at Molina, the buyer's remorse is now more intense.
Molina shares slumped more than 9 percent after the insurer reported a second-quarter loss of $4.10 per share, including restructuring costs that will result in staff reductions of 10 percent of its workforce. The company is withdrawing its 2017 earnings guidance, as it continues the search for a new chief executive.
Molina had made big bets on growing its exchange business, leveraging years of experience with Medicaid patients. But after continuing losses on some market exchange markets and some Medicaid contracts, the board ousted CEO Mario Molina last May and is undertaking a major restructuring plan.
""In retrospect, a better approach would have been to undertake a full review of the organization in anticipation of the potential growth resulting from the Affordable Care Act. Instead of increasing investment in existing processes, we should have conducted the full redesign of our business that we are doing now,"" said interim Molina CEO Joseph White, on the company's earnings conference call.
For 2018, the insurer is pulling out of the Utah and Wisconsin Obamacare exchanges, where it has experienced the biggest losses, in an effort to shore up its overall profitability.
In its remaining markets, the insurer is raising rates by 55 percent, citing its uncertainty over federal funding for cost-sharing subsidies.
""It is also important to note that the performance of our Marketplace products in California, Michigan, New Mexico and Texas remain acceptable,"" said White. ""We will continue to monitor political and programmatic developments in the Marketplace, and we may withdraw from additional markets for 2018, if necessary.""
Insurers have until late September to decide whether they are in or out of the state health insurance exchanges for next year.

 Aetna CEO: When health insurance gets fixed we'll reconsider rejoining exchanges   
 3:41  PM ET Thu,  3 Aug 2017 |  04:47 
 Congress needs to move on from repealing the Affordable Care Act, says Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini.
 ""The ACA cannot be repealed, period, end of sentence,"" Bertolini told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Thursday. 
""What we should do is fix it. So either everyone gets their heads together over in the Senate and the House and does the job that the American people needs them to do, and fix what we already have, or they should move on to something else,"" he said.
 ""It's really easy to fix this if they would just get over the politics of who is going to win the '18 election.""
For Aetna to rejoin the Obamacare markets, Bertolini says, the system needs to become more stabilized. 
""Any business that has the kind of changes this program has seen quarter over quarter, sometimes monthly, would not be able to sustain their business practices for any period of time,"" Bertolini said. ""So when they get it right — which, it can be fixed, it very much can be fixed — and it's stable, we'll reconsider participation.""
Late in July, President Donald Trump tweeted that if a new health-care bill failed to pass, ""bailouts"" — referring to the payments the government needs to make to prevent premiums rising even more next year — for insurance companies could end very soon. 
 Trump tweet
 However, Bertolini challenged what Trump called ""bailouts.""
""They aren't bailouts,"" Bertolini said. ""We don't keep that money. It goes directly to providers and directly to pay for premiums for members, so I think it's misinformed.""
""Our premiums are the same regardless, and it's the costs that need to be paid to hospitals and doctors that otherwise wouldn't be paid,"" he said. ""[The] only people who get hurt are the members and the citizens of the United States who won't get health care as a result, so these aren't bailouts for the insurance company.""
The Aetna CEO also fired back at those who say going to a single-payer system is a solution, which he said has failed in Vermont and Colorado.
""If we had the time, I'd take you through the logic of why single-payer, ill-defined, doesn't generate any savings for the American public,"" Bertolini said. 
""There are no single-payer systems in the version that we think we want to create in this country. ... We need to talk about the costs of health care, and getting those costs under control, and that doesn't happen by changing who pays the bills.""
Aetna, which reported a second-quarter beat, is up more than 27 percent year to date.

 Apple and Aetna hold secret meetings to bring the Apple Watch to millions of Aetna customers   
 5:14  PM ET Mon, 14 Aug 2017 |  00:51 
 Apple and Aetna held a series of secret discussions last week to bring Apple's health and fitness-tracking smartwatch to millions more people connected to Aetna, according to three people familiar with the matter. 
 The insurer, which covers 23 million, offers an Apple Watch to its 50,000 employees as part of its corporate wellness program. Now, Aetna is negotiating with Apple on a plan to offer a free or discounted Apple Watch, Apple's wearable device, as a perk to its members.
The invitation-only meetings took place in Southern California on Thursday and Friday, according to the people. Those in attendance included executives from Aetna and Apple, as well as hospital chief medical information officers across the country.
 Apple's Myoung Cha, who has the title ""special projects, health,"" led the discussions, said one of the people. The move by Aetna is part of its push to increase customer interest in a healthier lifestyle and a better tracking of diet, said one of the people.

 Apple Watch that can make calls? It's a game changer: Jim Cramer   
 9:30  AM ET Mon,  7 Aug 2017 |  01:44 
 The move could be a boon in sales for Apple Watch, which now offers health and fitness-tracking as its primary usage. Apple Watch recently overtook Fitbit as the top-selling wearable tracker, with shipments reaching 22 million for the first three months of 2017, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. The next version will reportedly have a new design and wireless connectivity, allowing it to connect to the internet without a nearby iPhone.
As CNBC previously reported, Apple is quietly developing new health sensors that would make its devices a ""must have"" for millions of people with chronic disease. It has a secret team working on adding continuous and noninvasive blood sugar monitoring to its hardware, which would be a game-changer for diabetics. 
One of the people said Aetna's proposed timeline is slated for early next year.
Apple's rival Fitbit has sold its fitness trackers to companies for years in a bid to improve health outcomes and lower costs. Bloomberg initially reported that Aetna would be the first insurer to offer Apple Watch to its employees in 2016. 
""This is a logical step for Apple's broader distribution of their watch, and this type of partnership has been on their radar from the beginning,"" said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, an advisory firm that specializes in technology.
Apple and Aetna declined to comment.

 Aetna CEO: I am ashamed of Trump's behavior, comments   
 6:43  PM ET Wed, 16 Aug 2017 |  00:58 
 The CEO of major health insurer Aetna on Wednesday blasted President Donald Trump for his controversial comments on a white supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Va.
 ""I am ashamed of our President's behavior and comments,"" wrote Aetna chief Mark Bertolini in a 'Dear Colleagues"" internal memo to employees, which was obtained by CNBC.
The memo came to light hours after Trump announced he was disbanding two White House business advisory councils on the heels of an exodus of CEOs from those councils because of the president's comments.
 Bertolini was not a member of either of those councils.
But like a number of other business leaders, he felt compelled to speak out after Trump on Tuesday again blamed ""both sides"" for the violence last weekend in Charlottesville, where neo-Nazis, members of the Ku Klux Klan and other bigots faced off against opponents.
Joseph Swedish, the CEO of another leading health insurer, Anthem, wrote employees a memo on Wednesday that condemned ""the bigotry, hatred and racism on display in Charlottesville last weekend.""
Bertolini's memo begins with a quote by slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.""
Bertolini then wrote: ""I can't help but comment on the current national dialogue surrounding the deplorable violence in Charlottesville.""
""I strongly agree with the remarks of former Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush who stated: 'America must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred of all forms,"" the CEO wrote.
""I am pleased that many other political leaders from both parties have expressed similarly strong statements – and I am ashamed of our President's behavior and comments.""
Bertolini continued: ""We all breathe the same air, we all want the same thing for our children's future, and we all aspire for the pursuit of happiness and good health for our families and friends. We are not a country of hate, and we are all judged by our own god based on the compassion and humanity we show others.""
""I hope that each of us takes time to discuss with our family and friends the responsibility we all share, every day, to live up to the values that have made our nation so great – those of tolerance and respect for others. We are a great nation because of our diversity which fosters sharing of ideas and experiences. Our country is not perfect, but it is more tolerant than any other nation I know. We can only remain great if we remain intolerant of hate.""
An Aetna spokesman declined to comment on the memo beyond confirming its authenticity. The spokesman said Bertolini would not be speaking to the media about the memo.
In his own memo, Anthem's CEO Swedish wrote, ""Intolerance and discrimination run counter to everything we value as Americans, and as Anthem associates.""
""The violence and radical ideology at the center of the protests were no less than an assault on human dignity and our societal foundation. There is no place for these actions or sentiments in our country,"" Swedish wrote. 
Swedish said that Anthem's ""commitment to diversity and inclusion is one that is very personal to me. As some of you may know, my parents immigrated to the United States in the early 1950s.""
""As the child of immigrants, I witnessed discrimination against my parents and experienced it against us, as a family. That is why, throughout my career, I have worked so hard to prioritize a commitment to diversity and inclusion in my prior roles leading health care institutions and at Anthem.""
Swedish also quoted King: ""The time is always right to do what is right.""

11,2017-08-17,Apple and Aetna met last week to talk about the Apple Watch—here's what they discussed  ,"David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc.
 Apple and Aetna conducted a series of meetings late last week to discuss the next step in their partnership, as reported by CNBC.
 The primary topic of discussion was Apple's health-tracking smartwatch -- Apple Watch -- and whether it could be used to improve health outcomes. Currently, Aetna is gathering feedback from its own employees, who are currently testing whether the watch can help them eat better and exercise more regularly. 
Mandi Bishop was among a small group of digital health influencers invited to the event. Chief medical officers from various health systems and a select group of Aetna employees were also invited, with Apple's Myoung Cha presiding over many of the discussions. 
 Bishop, who previously ran global health analytics at Dell and now has a startup called Lifely Insights, shared a few of her impressions from the event. 
 Data privacy
 Bishop recalled that a huge portion of the event involved discussions about data privacy. 
""Both companies wanted to make sure that we knew what data is shared and what isn't,"" she said. 
Bishop said some Aetna employees were asking about whether the health data collected by Apple Watch could be shared with external vendors. Others requested to extract data like heart rate and other vital signs from the watch, so they could store it in a personal health record.
One of the biggest concerns with companies like Apple and Fitbit collecting health information, like steps and heart rate, is that it could get into the wrong hands. These fears are amplified as technology companies strike deals with self-insured employers and health plans. 
For its part, Apple has repeatedly stressed that health data can only be shared with user consent. And these policies extend to third-party apps for iPhone and Apple Watch. 
 Cost
 ""A lot of Aetna employees talked about being able to afford the Apple Watch for the entire family,"" said Bishop. One theme that emerged during the event, she said, is that many of those who were enrolled in the program wanted to get healthy alongside their families. But many couldn't afford to spend upwards of $1,000 on devices for their spouses and children. 
The cost issue wasn't entirely resolved, she said, but it proved to be a sticking point. It remains unclear whether Aetna will extend its discounts from employees and/or members to their family-members. 
 Bugs and features
 Many of those who tested out the watch had a lot of positive comments to share with Apple, but there were a few issues to iron out.
One complaint was the lack of situational awareness, such as a reminder to move when a user was on a long flight, or an alert to meditate in the middle of a conference call.
""Everyone wanted the technology to be totally seamless,"" she said. 
 Solving for chronic disease 
 Most wearable products today are targeted to people who are already health-conscious and are eager to better track their workouts. But for a device like Apple Watch to make a big difference to health insurers, it needs to attract people who have costly chronic diseases. It also needs to appeal to an older demographic, and not just the young and healthy. 
Already, Apple is making steps in this direction by releasing its bluetooth API for Apple Watch, which allows users to sync their watch to a glucose sensor from medical device makers like Dexcom. That's a particularly useful feature for patients with diabetes.
Bishop envisions a future where the device could collect important health information, and even alert health plans or providers about a serious medical event. ""That's where it gets really useful,"" she said.

Pedestrians walk past Aetna headquarters in Hartford, Connecticut.
 Groups representing people with HIV are demanding that health insurer Aetna change the way it mails instructions for filling prescriptions as it violates federal and state privacy laws and could expose them to discrimination.
Information about HIV medications could become visible through the window of the envelope, the groups allege, when the envelopes are processed in the mail. The questionable envelopes were also used on letters sent to those on a prescription regimen called pre-exposure prophylaxis, which helps prevent people from acquiring HIV.
Aetna told customers in a followup notification letter that the ""privacy breach"" occurred on July 28 and that the insurer learned about it on July 31.

The demand letter was written on behalf of patients in Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington, D.C. The letter calls on Aetna to develop a plan to correct its practices and procedures.
""Aetna's privacy violation devastated people whose neighbors and family learned their intimate health information,"" Sally Friedman, legal director of the Legal Action Center in New York City, said in a statement.
Aetna issued a statement responding to the allegations, saying, ""we sincerely apologize to those affected by a mailing issue that inadvertently exposed the personal health information of some Aetna members. This type of mistake is unacceptable, and we are undertaking a full review of our processes to ensure something like this never happens again.""

 At Wal-Mart, Wanamaker's role involved leading business development and strategy for the company's health, wellness and e-commerce businesses, with a focus on partnerships.  
Wanamaker's LinkedIn page still lists Wanamaker as a current employee of Wal-Mart. 
 As CNBC reported last month, the Apple/Aetna venture is picking up steam. Representatives from both companies met earlier this month to discuss plans to provide free or discounted Apple smartwatches to Aetna's multimillion-strong member base. 
That presents a big sales opportunity for Apple's smartwatch, especially if other major health insurers follow suit.
That partnership was  first announced in the fall of 2016. At that time, Aetna said it would be the first health care company to subsidize the cost of Apple Watch via monthly payroll deductions.
Apple and Aetna's joint venture focuses on Apple Watch, which includes health and fitness as a primary use case. Apple Watch lets its users set workout goals, track steps and other metrics, as well as monitor their heart rate.
There's a big opportunity for Apple and other makers of fitness trackers to provide them to enterprises, not just consumers. HR departments across the country see opportunities to leverage activity trackers and smartwatches to improve their members' overall health. Payers, including self-insured employers and insurers, are looking for ways to boost wellness to prevent their members from getting costly conditions, like heart disease and diabetes. 
Wal-Mart's health care offerings include online tools for anyone to search for a health insurance plan or buy supplies for a medical cabinet. It also has a pharmacy business.
Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Pharmacy behemoth CVS Health is in talks to buy Aetna, sources familiar said, in a surprising deal that would amount to the biggest ever for the health insurance industry.
 Aetna shares soared by a much as 12 percent Thursday when news of the deal first broke.
CVS Health has proposed to pay more than $200 per share for Aetna, the sources familiar confirmed to CNBC.
 Aetna, which as of Thursday had a market value of $53 billion, was trading at about $175 per share after news.
CVS Health shares were down nearly 3 percent for the day and continued lower in premarket trading Friday.
In addition to a chain of retail pharmacies, CVS Health also operates the Caremark pharmacy benefit manager, which has more than 75 million plan members.
Asked about the potential deal, an Aetna spokesman told CNBC, ""We don't comment on rumor or speculation.""
A spokesman for CVS Health said, ""As a matter of policy we don't comment on market rumors such as this.""
The Wall Street Journal first reported the proposed acquisition.
Aetna in February abandoned an effort to merge with another large health insurer, Humana, after that $34 billion deal was blocked on antitrust grounds by a federal judge.

 Price for CVS-Aetna depends on other offers that come in: Morningstar health care analyst   
 8:00  PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 |  01:32 
 CVS Health appears willing to pay top dollar for a health insurer in an effort to hold its own against competitors.
 Drugstore operator CVS is in talks to buy health insurer Aetna for a proposed $200 per share or more, sources familiar said. The $66 billion or greater deal would be the largest ever in health insurance history, according to an analysis of Thomson Reuters data. 
The deal comes as the $467 billion e-commerce giant Amazon.com has been quietly exploring ways to expand into the pharmaceutical industry. Jeff Bezos' company has also contributed to the struggles of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like CVS.

 ""They needed to defend the business from encroachment by Amazon,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill told CNBC. ""Amazon's ability to impact the business over the near to mid term is low, but the ability to impact the stock is high.""
CVS would lose the ability to control its own destiny if it didn't do something, Hill added. ""This could be $260 billion in revenue [in 2019].""
The Wall Street Journal first reported that CVS was in talks to buy the health insurer.
CVS has already been trying to establish greater control in its corner of the health care industry. In 2007, the company acquired Caremark pharmacy benefit manager, which has more than 75 million plan members.
Aetna shares closed Thursday 11.5 percent higher at $178.60 a share after The Wall Street Journal posted its report.  CVS shares fell about 3 percent Thursday and were down another 0.4 percent in premarket trading Friday.
""The key here is you're going to control the health-care participants in a much greater way,"" said CFRA senior analyst Joseph Agnese. By acquiring Aetna, CVS could offer customers lower co-pays in the drug stores.
""That will incentivize 23 million people to come to CVS rather than Walgreens,"" Agnese said. He has a hold recommendation on CVS Health. ""I find it very difficult to imagine how Amazon will enter the space without making big acquisitions.""
An Amazon spokeswoman told CNBC in a statement the company has a ""longstanding practice of not commenting on rumors and speculation."" 
CNBC reported in May that Amazon has been recruiting health insurance experts to develop an internal pharmacy benefits manager for Amazon employees. 
However, RBC's Hill expects that, if Amazon were to announce an online pharmacy, it would still take the internet commerce behemoth a decade to get even 10 percent of market share. 
In September, Hill had predicted an ""inflection point"" ahead for CVS should the company transform itself by acquiring a managed care organization like Aetna. Such a move, Hill said at the time, ""could transform itself and the space more broadly.""
Hill told CNBC on Thursday he was optimistic how it appeared that CVS was now pursuing the right strategy. ""A year into this transaction, not only do you have a company with formidable offerings [in health care, but] maybe only United could compete.""

 CVS is under pressure in their retail pharmacy business: Fmr. Universal American CEO   
 2:23  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  04:12 
 CVS Health shares fell about 6 percent Friday after news broke of its talks to acquire health insurance provider Aetna for $66 billion. But analysts say the drop could be more related to Amazon entering the health-care space, than to pre-acquisition arbitrage.
 ""There is something in play today with Amazon. All that risk, discussion about Amazon going into the pharmacy space. That's putting a lot of pressure today on the whole drug supply chain,"" Jeffries analyst Brian Tanquilut said on CNBC's Power Lunch.
Shares for an acquiring company, like CVS, typically fall before a merger for a number of reasons. The company may take on debt, struggle to culturally integrate or pay a premium for shares. But shortly after news broke of the potential acquisition Thursday, CVS stocks rebounded, suggesting investors supported the idea.
 ""They are under pressure in their retail business, they are under pressure in their retail pharmacy business and they are under pressure in their [pharmacy benefit manager] business, so the need to diversify is pretty important,"" Richard Barasch, former CEO of Universal American said. In 2011, CVS bought Universal American's Medicare prescription drug business for $1.25 billion. 
In an industry where standalone businesses are diminishing, analysts and investors seem to agree that the potential partnership between CVS and Aetna would secure the companies a place in the future health space. Diversifying could steel the Rhode Island-based pharmacy against United Health Care, which has data analytics, pharmacy benefits and physician groups at their disposal.
But Amazon poses new unknowns for the healthcare industry.
""They're terrific at mail order. They are great at distribution,"" Barasch said, describing Amazon.
Experts anticipate it could take the internet commerce company about a decade to even get 10 percent market share, but the market still reacted. CVS shares were trading in tandem with Walgreens Friday afternoon.

Pedestrians walk past a CVS Health Corp. store in Chicago.
 Wall Street analysts are a bit confused by pharmacy CVS Health's possible purchase of health insurance provider Aetna, the largest proposed deal ever for the insurance industry.
 Calling the idea ""insane,"" Jefferies health-care desk analyst Jared Holz said CVS' move to acquire Aetna came much sooner than he expected.
""My view is [that there is] too much debt here and CVS winds up being levered nearly 5x to get this done,"" said Holz in a note to clients. ""The entire supply chain is a structural short until Amazon [is] proven to be [an] anemic player. Which won't happen.""
 If CVS bought the health insurer at the proposed price of $200 per share, the $66 billion deal would be the largest ever in the health insurance history, based on analysis of Thomson Reuters data.
Shares of CVS have fallen nearly 9 percent since the news of the deal broke, with the stock closing down 6 percent Friday.
Many Wall Street analysts feel that such a costly move by CVS would be in direct response to e-commerce giant Amazon.com's moves into the pharmaceutical space. CNBC reported in May that Amazon has been recruiting health insurance experts to develop an internal pharmacy benefits manager for Amazon employees.
""I hear smart people tell me it's a slam dunk and other people say it could have a lot of problems,"" Cowen analyst Charles Rhyee told CNBC. ""It's a lot to spend, and it's not that by doing so CVS will automatically transform its retail footprint.""
""We see the move into healthcare services as a natural defense against the potential threat of Amazon,"" he added in a note. ""Our question, however, is why can't CVS affect the transformation into a healthcare platform on its own?""
Based on Rhyee's estimates, CVS could end up paying out more than $75 billion for Aetna, exceeding the company's current $70.9 billion market cap.
CVS did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
""Couldn't CVS effect the changes to its retail footprint and then partner with multiple health plans, including Aetna, and achieve similar results with less capital?"" asked Rhyee, suggesting that CVS could ""roll up"" the entire $16 billion urgent-care market if it wanted.
To be sure, CVS has been trying to establish greater control in its corner of the health-care industry. In 2007, the company acquired Caremark pharmacy benefits manager, which has more than 75 million plan members.
Following the Caremark acquisition, the company changed its name to CVS Health from CVS and permanently halted cigarette and cigar sales in 2014.

 Fierce competition between PBMs: Leerink Partners' Ana Gupte   
 6:40  AM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  03:53 
 CVS talks to buy health insurer Aetna for as much as $66 billion makes sense because the drugstore operator and prescription benefit manager has been facing threats from all sides, including from Amazon, a leading analyst told CNBC on Friday. A deal of this nature would add health insurance plans to the CVS Health portfolio.
 ""CVS has so many threats coming at them,"" said Ana Gupte, a senior health care services analyst at Leerink Partners. She said one threat in particular is from OptumRx, UnitedHealth Group's pharmacy benefit management business. So-called PBMs such as OptumRx and CVS' Caremark unit negotiate drug benefits for insurance plans and employers.
Amazon is also ""clearly a huge piece of this,"" Gupte added in a ""Squawk Box"" interview. The online retail giant has been exploring ways to expand into the drug industry, including selling prescription drugs online.
 Gupte says Amazon is thinking hard about its decision, but she added that ""all signs"" point to Amazon entering into the pharmaceutical industry.
""They may choose to say, 'Hey, should we hurt our brand with all this government scrutiny in an industry and where profit margins are a threat?'"" Gupte said. ""But, Amazon has always been the leader, and margins will compress, and Amazon is fine with that.""
""They're going to disrupt the whole thing like they did for the bookstore industry,"" she added.
When considering the price of the CVS-Aetna deal, Gupte said it represents about a 25 percent premium to Aetna's price, and CVS ""has to do something."" 
Also on ""Squawk Box,"" RBC health-care analyst Frank Morgan said the possible CVS-Aetna deal showcases a reflection of the consolidation happening in the overall health market. 
The moves toward value-based purchasing and consumerization are responsible for the integration of PBMs in health-care businesses, he said.
""Obviously, we're very concerned about health-care inflation here in America,"" Morgan added. 
The deal could improve CVS' competitiveness to offer a fully integrated health insurance and drug service offering, he said.

 CVS-Aetna deal all about vertical integration   
 7:18  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  02:25 
 CVS Health appears to have chosen a friendlier foe in insurers than the Seattle-based giant that has been lurking in the shadows.
 The drugstore operator is in talks to buy health insurer Aetna for a proposed $200 per share or more, sources familiar with the matter say. In owning Aetna, CVS would become the first health-care triple threat: A pharmacy, a pharmacy benefit manager and now an insurer.
The sources declined to be identified because the information is confidential. Aetna and CVS declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the deal talks. 
 The potential deal would give CVS even more scale to bargain better prices for the prescription drugs it sells on its counters. It could fortify Aetna's insurance business by creating the ability to offer its insured cheaper copayments, presumably only in CVS stores. Its vast retail footprint could serve as a cost-effective distribution center, or locations for in-store clinics. 
It therefore puts insurers, like UnitedHealth Group, which owns a PBM through its Optum health-services business but not a vast store base, directly in its line of fire. (A PBM typically is a third party that negotiates prescription drug benefits for a commercial health plan.)
Insurers might be an easier shot than Amazon. The e-commerce giant, which surged to a market capitalization of $530 billion on Friday, has increasingly signaled its intention to move into the business of selling prescription drugs. It has already received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12 states, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported this week. It will make a decision by Thanksgiving on whether to enter the industry, CNBC has reported.
With Amazon selling drugs, customers would have even less reason to go into CVS stores than they do now. Consumers can now find cosmetic and household staples at other retailers and online, sometimes for a lower price. Its pharmacy business is already larger than its so-called front-of-store business, and it is becoming increasingly so.
For its fiscal 2016, same-store sales from CVS' front-of-store business were down 1.5 percent, while pharmacy sales were up 3.2 percent. The percentage of money it makes from its front store compared with its total revenue fell to 23.6 percent in 2016, from 28.8 percent in 2014.
If past serves as precedent, the battle to fight Amazon can be painful for a company and its shareholders. Since Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, grocery and food stocks have lost a total of $50 billion in market capitalization, CNBC data show. 
By owning an insurer, CVS creates a field more difficult for Amazon to play on. It would be challenging, though conceivable, for Amazon to buy an insurer, due to the particular regulatory constraints they operate under. It would also thus serve as a potential poison pill to fend off any Amazon approaches.
To be sure, CVS also may face regulatory hurdles of its own in an Aetna bid, particularly in a politically charged environment in which the government has been looking at ever-escalating prescription drug costs. 
Beyond Amazon, the move would be a logical progression for CVS, which has been transforming itself into a health-care business for years. It acquired its Caremark pharmacy benefit manager platform in 2007 and in 2014, it changed its name from CVS Caremark to CVS Health.
CVS and Aetna have already begun to test a relationship, having signed a contract to work together in 2010.

18,2017-11-06,CVS beats earnings expectations amid potential Aetna tie-up  ,"CVS Health delivered earnings that beat analyst expectations on Monday, boosted by the strength in its pharmacy services business, which offset weaker sales in its retail business.
 Here's how CVS did in the third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected:
 Adjusted EPS: $1.50 cents vs. of $1.48 expected, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $46.2 billion vs. $46.17 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters   The drugstore operator also announced it would start next-day delivery from its stores in 2018, a move some analysts are saying comes in response to Amazon's encroaching presence within the space. ""We will bring the pharmacy to our patients' doorsteps,"" Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on a call with analysts and investors. Meantime, CVS is in talks to buy health insurer Aetna for a  proposed $200 per share or more, sources familiar with the matter say. The potential deal comes as CVS moves further into health care amid increasing pressure on its traditional retail sales. CVS reported net revenue of $46.18 billion, up 3.5 percent from the same quarter last year, and essentially in line with Thomson Reuters estimates. In the third quarter, CVS said its net income fell to $1.29 billion, or $1.26 per share, from $1.54 billion, or $1.43 a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.50 per share, outpacing Wall Street estimates of $1.48 per share.  The Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based company has been transforming itself into a health-care business for years, propelled by its acquisition of the Caremark pharmacy benefit manager platform in 2007. (A PBM typically is a third party that negotiates prescription drug benefits for a commercial health plan.) It generated net sales of $32.9 billion for its PBM business for the quarter — roughly 70 percent of its sales — up 8.1 percent from the quarter before. Profitability in the division though was hurt by pressure on drug prices. An acquisition of an insurer like Aetna could give CVS greater bargaining power with drug companies.  Sales of cosmetics and household goods, CVS' ""front of store"" business, meanwhile dropped 2.8 percent. CVS increasingly faces competition for these goods from big-box stores and grocers, sometimes for a lower price.  Amazon's potential move into selling prescription drugs online adds further threat, because shoppers would be less likely to go to CVS to pick up their medications, and thus other household goods. The Seattle giant also recently launched ""Discount provided by Amazon"" promotions, in which it slashes prices on third-party goods it is selling, in order to meet or beat the prices of its rivals like Wal-Mart. CVS narrowed and raised the midpoint of the range for full-year adjusted earnings per share from $5.87 to $5.91. Including the charges due to hurricanes, from $5.83 to $5.93.

 CVS-Aetna deal 'really smart' way to ward off Amazon   
 2:50  PM ET Mon, 13 Nov 2017 |  00:55 
 CVS Health's bid to acquire health insurer Aetna is a ""really smart"" way of staving off competition from Amazon.com, according to one Wall Street analyst.
 Needham upgraded shares of CVS to a buy rating and bumped its price target on the retail pharmacy, praising the company's proactive actions as competition from e-commerce giant Amazon looms.
""The next month may shape the outlook and direction for CVS for the next 10 years,"" wrote Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo in a note to clients. ""Even in the face of an impending competitive entry in pharmacy by Amazon, we find the risk-reward on the stock favorable, especially if CVS is able to consummate the reported merger with Aetna.""
 The analyst increased his price target on the company to $79, which represents 14 percent upside from Thursday's close. Caliendo believes a new CVS-Aetna could ""easily"" grow earnings 10 percent annually down the road, given no hiccups in pharmacy benefit management during integration or lost share to Amazon.
Shares of CVS Health closed nearly 3 percent higher Friday.
The reported $66 billion deal between CVS and Aetna would be the largest in health insurance history. The move is viewed by many on the Street as a strategic play to bolster the defenses of both companies against a potential move by Amazon into the industry.
The $544 billion e-commerce giant Amazon has been quietly exploring ways to expand into the pharmaceutical industry. Jeff Bezos' company has also contributed to the struggles of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like CVS.
CVS announced this month that it plans to bring prescriptions ""right to customers' doors"" with next-day delivery starting in 2018, akin to Amazon's competitive shipping method for Prime members.
The company also announced late last month that it would be partnering with Walgreens Boots Alliance in starting the 30,000-store network in an attempt to reduce costs both for the company and for pharmacy benefit management (PBM) members.
""We do think CVS announcing its agreement with Walgreens to create a 30,000 store national network with 10,000 to be named independent pharmacies is a direct land-share grab to limit Amazon's potential partnering options,"" added Caliendo.
""And the more recent announcement that CVS will provide next day fulfillment to individuals is clearly a service that would compete with Amazon.""

22,2017-11-30,CVS reportedly near deal to buy Aetna for around $66 billion  ,"Getty Images
 CVS Health could announce an acquisition of insurer Aetna for more than $66 billion as early as Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. 
 The talks are advanced and would likely see Aetna valued at between $200 and $205 a share and be comprised mainly of cash, the Journal reported.
The talks, like all deal discussions, could be delayed or ultimately fail, the Journal cautioned.
 Aetna had a market capitalization of $59.27 billion after the report came out Thursday morning. Shares rose about 1 percent. CVS had a market capitalization of $77.2 billion as of Thursday morning, and its shares rose more than 2 percent on the report.
CVS and Aetna both declined to comment. 
Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based CVS has been transforming itself into a health-care business for years, propelled by its acquisition of the Caremark pharmacy benefit manager platform in 2007. (A PBM typically is a third party that negotiates prescription drug benefits for a commercial health plan.)
This past quarter,  CVS generated roughly 70 percent of its sales from its PBM business — up 8.1 percent from the quarter before. 
An acquisition of an insurer like Aetna could give CVS more scale to bargain better prices for the prescription drugs it sells on its counters. It could fortify Aetna's insurance business by creating the ability to offer its insured cheaper copayments, presumably only in CVS stores. Its vast retail footprint could serve as a cost-effective distribution center, or locations for in-store clinics.
It comes as Amazon has been threatening to enter the drug industry in some fashion. With Amazon as a competitor, customers would have even less reason to go into CVS stores than they do now. Shoppers can now find cosmetic and household staples at other retailers and online, sometimes for a lower price.
Amazon recently told regulators it will use pharmacy licenses it obtained from Tennessee and Indiana to sell medical devices and supplies, not to sell prescriptions.
For Aetna, the deal would mark a change in strategy after its attempted tie-up with Humana was blocked by a federal court on antitrust grounds. A CVS deal would be a so-called vertical integration — an acquisition down a company's supply chain rather than ""horizontal"" — an acquisition of a direct competitor. Such deals are thought to be less threatening to antitrust authorities. Still, AT&T, which is making the largest recent attempt at vertical integration with its proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner, has been sued by the Department of Justice to stop the deal.

 CVS moves closer to $66B deal to buy Aetna   
 6:48  AM ET Fri,  1 Dec 2017 |  02:26 
 A potential tie-up between CVS Health and insurer Aetna may force the health-care industry to rethink and further shuffle ownership.
One analyst sees a natural connection between Wal-Mart and Humana as a reason the retail giant could acquire the health insurer. Humana steers its members to Wal-Mart pharmacies for deals on prescription co-pays.
 ""Humana and Wal-Mart have been in a very tight relationship for six, seven years,"" Dr. Ana Gupte, a senior health-care services analyst at Leerink Partners, told ""Squawk Box"" on Friday.
 Walgreens, Cigna and Anthem also may be among those who are looking to strike a deal to better compete in the shifting landscape, according to Gupte. 
She sees a potential deal for Humana going for more than $46 billion, saying a buyer would have to pay a ""25 percent to 30 percent premium now."" The company has a market value of over $37  billion, according to FactSet.
CVS is closing in on a $66 billion deal for Aetna, which would be the largest ever in health insurance history, according to an analysis of Thomson Reuters data.

 ""You can't be prepared if you're half-asleep,"" he said, saying he has the numbers to back up his assertion that better sleep can lead to bigger profits.
Bertolini's not the only business leader who's putting sleep first: Jeff Bezos, Sheryl Sandberg and Arianna Huffington all have packed schedules as well, but you won't catch them burning the midnight oil.
In addition to Bertolini, CNBC rounded up six other super successful people who all prioritize sleep.
 Jeff Bezos
 Amazon's Jeff Bezos makes a point of getting enough sleep every single night.
""Eight hours of sleep makes a big difference for me, and I try hard to make that a priority,"" he  tells Thrive Global. ""For me, that's the needed amount to feel energized and excited.""
Adequate rest not only leaves Bezos invigorated for the day to come but allows him to continuously make sharp, thoughtful choices without suffering from decision fatigue. That's what can happen when choices become harder as a day goes on and you deplete your finite store of energy.
""Mostly, as any of us go through our lives, we don't need to maximize the number of decisions we make per day,"" Bezos explains. ""Making a small number of key decisions well is more important than making a large number of decisions. If you shortchange your sleep, you might get a couple of extra 'productive' hours, but that productivity might be an illusion.""

""If one is too tired to consider butterfly effect of their actions, they could set themselves up for quantum chaos,"" he writes. ""We all know that feeling when we are awake, productive, full of energy and happy to be alive. Those are the days when the fabric of life twists and turns in our favor, being productive is easy, and nothing can stop you.""

""I used to work all night in the office, but it's been quite a while since I lived on catnap,"" he says in a  Microsoft FAQ. ""I like to get seven hours of sleep a night because that's what I need to stay sharp and creative and upbeat.""

""It's incumbent upon all of us who run companies, and all of us, to make sure that people can make ends meet and have the ability to get a good night's sleep,"" she adds.

The Huffington Post founder started researching the intersection of sleep and productivity and even wrote books on the topic: ""The Sleep Revolution"" and ""Thrive.""
Now, she follows a strict four-step ritual before going to bed every night to ensure good sleep. Huffington's routine includes leaving her devices outside of the bedroom and wearing items specifically for sleep — not loungewear or gym clothes.

Mark Bertolini
 Telemedicine, or virtual medical consults by phone or video, has been the ""next big thing"" in health care for more than a decade. But year after year, countless studies have found that telemedicine companies are held back by a lack of awareness among consumers. 
 Now, thanks to a marketing boost from behemoths like Apple, Aetna and CVS, telemedicine might finally take off. 
When pitching the benefits of a merger with CVS, Aetna's chief executive, Mark Bertolini, detailed how technology that monitors patients from home — like bluetooth-connected glucose meters coupled with apps for virtual providers to nudge patients when their glucose levels are off — is a key part of his strategy. In other words, telemedicine. 
 He described this strategy as an approach that will improve care and lower skyrocketing health costs for consumers by providing ""a more holistic view of each individual.""
Apple's COO, Jeff Williams, also advocated for virtual medicine last week, when detailing the company's plans for its new heart-health study. In an important move, Apple chose to work with one of the largest telemedicine start-ups, American Well, so that even those without easy access to a doctor's office can still get the help they need. 
 'It was a huge deal'
 Apple and Aetna are signaling that the future of medicine involves a lot of monitoring of patients from home, rather than at the hospital or clinic.
And that's great news for the growing crop of venture-backed companies that offer virtual consultations, home-health monitoring and digital health apps. It's finally making people aware of some technology that's been around for years, which represents a more convenient alternative than a long drive to a medical clinic. It's also an affordable option, as most telemedicine visits are covered by insurance with a small copay. 
""It was a huge deal,"" for us, said American Well's chairman and CEO, Ido Schoenberg, when asked about the Apple partnership. 
Schoenberg said telemedicine companies have made big steps in overcoming other obstacles, including payment and state-by-state regulation. 
But adoption remains a challenge. Hospitals and doctor's offices might increasingly start to offer virtual consults, he said, but it doesn't mean that consumers know they exist. And few people will peruse their insurance company or employer website to find out if it's a benefit. 
""For so many people, this will be a new model of care presented to them for the first time,"" he said.

 CVS CEO Larry Merlo on Aetna deal: It's the perfect time to bring these companies together   
 7:40  AM ET Mon,  4 Dec 2017 |  03:14 
 The proposed CVS Health-Aetna megamerger will reduce health-care costs for consumers immediately, the CEOs of both companies told CNBC on Monday.
 CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo and Aetna Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini spoke on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Monday, one day after announcing that CVS will acquire Aetna for roughly $69 billion in cash and stock. The deal would combine CVS' pharmacy business and pharmacy benefit manager platform, also referred to as a PBM, with Aetna's insurance business.
Upon closing, ""they'll be things we'll be able to do out of the gate,"" Merlo told CNBC. ""Over the next couple of years, you'll see a dramatic change in terms of the store not just being about products but also service offerings that can help people on their path to better health.""
 CVS plans to run Aetna as a separate business unit. Bertolini will be on the combined company's board but won't be in charge of Aetna unit. The CEOs say they've had a business relationship since 2010.
Merlo said he and Bertolini wanted to create a health-care platform that's ""easier to use and less expensive for users.""
 ""It's really the perfect time,"" he said. ""We have the ability to begin to bend that cost curve and at the same time help people achieve their best health.""

 Aetna CEO: We need a bipartisan solution to health care   
 7:29  AM ET Mon,  4 Dec 2017 |  01:49 
 The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. ""We'll look forward to sitting down with the regulators, talking about how this comes to life in a meaningful way,"" Merlo said.
The deal marks a change in strategy for Aetna. Earlier this year, Aetna's $37 billion plan to acquire smaller health insurance company Humana was blocked by a federal judge over antitrust concerns.
When asked whether they're concerned about regulators regarding their deal, the CEOs told CNBC they believe ""the transaction is highly complementary.""
The deal also comes as online retail giant Amazon has the potential to enter the drug industry and has held preliminary talks with makers of generic drugs. 
Aetna shares were more than 3 percent higher in premarket on Monday, while CVS stock was down slightly, about 0.2 percent.

Pedestrians pass in front of a Walgreens store in Chicago.
 CVS Health's $69 billion acquisition of Aetna will change the pharmacy and health-care industries alike. The deal creates the first health-care triple threat, combining CVS' pharmacy and pharmacy benefits manager platform with Aetna's insurance business.
 The threat to pharmacies — or those that own them — is the way in which the two will leverage Aetna's network of 46 million members to drive traffic to CVS stores. Aetna subscribers will be able to pick up prescription medicine in CVS stores while receiving pharmacy and medical services. Eventually, they may also be able to find lower copays only at CVS. 
""Over the next couple of years, you'll see a dramatic change in terms of the store not just being about products but also service offerings that can help people on their path to better health,"" CVS CEO Larry Merlo told CNBC on Monday. 
 Retailers are now facing an entirely new form of competitor while contending with the potential threat of Amazon encroaching into their space. They have already begun to examine what the deal means for their business, and the solution may entail acquisitions, industry advisors say. 
The pool of retailers directly affected is relatively small. They include Kroger, Wal-Mart,  Walgreens Boots Alliance and, to a lesser extent, Rite Aid.
Of the retailers, Walgreens arguably has the most to lose. It is the most similar to CVS in business model and the most reliant on drug sales to drive traffic into stores. The household and personal care products it sells can now be found online and often for less. The retailer generated 69 percent of its U.S. sales in its pharmacy. Abroad, where the retail industry is less competitive, it generated 35 percent of its sales in its pharmacy. 
But Walgreens many years ago set itself down a road different from that of CVS. Rather than diving into health care, as CVS did, Walgreens doubled down on real estate and international expansion. It acquired British pharmacy giant Alliance Boots in 2014, opening it up into Europe. It attempted to acquire Rite Aid a year later, in a $17.5 billion deal that looked to bring with it 4,600 stores. Regulators, though, whittled the deal down to a purchase of 1,932 stores for $4.37 billion.

 Implications of the DOJ's suit against ATT-Time Warner on future mergers   
 7:26  AM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 |  01:42 
 The essentially blocked deal makes Walgreens particularly sensitive to regulatory risks posed by further deals that could come in reaction to CVS-Aetna, industry advisors say. 
One possible route for Walgreens is to acquire the wholesale drug distributor  AmerisourceBergen, with whom it has been partnering since 2013. Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina is familiar with the industry, having come from pharmaceutical wholesale.
It could also more closely follow CVS' path, acquiring Humana, the remaining party from the abandoned Aetna-Humana tie-up. 
As for Rite Aid, it is now left as a distant third player to CVS and Walgreens. The retailer has a $2 billion market capitalization and roughly 4,700 stores, compared with CVS' 10,000 and Walgreens' 8,100. Analysts last month speculated it could be a target for Amazon if the retail juggernaut wanted to tap Rite Aid's pharmacy licenses and regulatory cleared stores. Amazon would also inherit pharmacy licenses in 19 states and six distribution centers.
If Amazon wanted to acquire a pharmacy benefits manager platform as its entree into health care, it could look to Express Scripts. The company's CEO recently told Bloomberg he would be ""open to"" a deal with an insurer. A PBM typically is a third party that negotiates prescription drug benefits for a commercial health plan. Acquiring such a company would give Amazon access to tap drug rebates for its customers. 
Meantime, Wal-Mart generates about 11 percent of its sales in what it calls ""health and wellness,"" a category that includes pharmacy, optical services, clinical services and over-the-counter drugs. With a stock that has grown 40 percent this year, giving it a $290 billion market cap, it may not feel particularly under the gun to make a large defensive play. The retailer's focus more recently, meanwhile, has been expanding its digital initiatives, propelled by its acquisition of Jet.com.
The big-box store also tends to be price-conservative and averse to heavily regulated industries, as demonstrated by its resistance to unions. A deal with an insurer would flout both those predilections.
Kroger likewise has a business that far exceeds pharmacy sales. Of its 2,796 supermarkets, 2,255 have pharmacies, which generated 9 percent of its sales last year. 
Diving into the health-care space may be a distraction for Kroger, as it works to reinvent its food business to compete with the Amazon-Whole Foods tie-up. Its still-strong food business, meanwhile, provides the company reason to draw shoppers into its stores beyond household staples. With Kroger's stock down 22 percent this year, and its focus on reinvesting in its core food business, it may not have the appetite for a large-scale deal. 
Of course, defense does not need to come in the form of an acquisition. Wal-Mart and Kroger could in theory partner with a PBM, which the two retailers could use to get better drug rates. Doing so could create an entity that rivals the scale of Walgreens.

QUICK: THAT IS NOT EXACTLY SOMETHING THAT WAS A HUGE SURPRISE OR SECRET. WE KNEW THAT IT WAS BEHIND THE SCENES GETTING WORKED UP, BUT WHY DON'T YOU TWO TELL US HOW YOU GOT TOGETHER AND WHY, WHY THIS MERGER MAKES SENSE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE?
MERLO: WELL YOU KNOW WHAT, BECKY, WE'VE HAD A BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP GOING BACK TO 2010. AND AS MARK AND I CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS IN TERMS OF HOW CAN WE DO THINGS MORE STRATEGICALLY, YOU KNOW, IT WAS CLEAR AS CVS HEALTH WAS MOVING TO BECOME MORE OF A HEALTH CARE COMPANY AND GETTING CLOSER TO PAYERS, MARK HAD A SIMILAR STRATEGY IN TERMS OF GETTING CLOSER TO THE CUSTOMER. AND IT'S REALLY THE PERFECT TIME TO BRING THESE TWO COMPANIES TOGETHER TO CREATE A NEW HEALTH CARE PLATFORM THAT CAN BE EASIER TO USE, LESS EXPENSIVE FOR CONSUMERS, AND REALLY CREATE A NEW FRONT DOOR TO HEALTH CARE IN OUR COUNTRY.
QUICK: AND MARK, YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT WANTING TO GET CLOSER TO CONSUMERS. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SITUATION NOW WHERE YOU HAVE MORE THAN 9,700 RETAIL STORES AND MINUTE CLINICS TOO. HOW MANY MINUTE CLINICS ARE OUT THERE?
MARK BERTOLINI: WE HAVE ABOUT 1,100.
QUICK: OK, SO THAT'S A WAY TO REACH YOUR CUSTOMER. WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO WITH THOSE?
BERTOLINI: WELL, IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT THE CONSUMER THINKS ABOUT HEALTH CARE, IT'S A SINGLE – SINGLE HIGHEST LINE ITEM BUDGET IN THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET TODAY AND IT'S THE MOST CONFUSING SYSTEM THAT ANYONE COULD USE. SO THINK OF AN IDEA WHERE WE HAVE 10,000 NEW FRONT DOORS TO THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN WALK IN, WHERE THEY CAN ASK FOR SOME HELP, GET GUIDANCE THROUGH THE SYSTEM. WE CAN MAKE THE INSURANCE THE BACK ROOM OF THE OPERATION AND WE CAN WAIVE PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. WE CAN WAIVE CO-PAYS AS PEOPLE USE THE SYSTEM THAT'S MORE EFFECTIVE. WE CAN REDUCE COSTS. SO, IT'S SIMPLER, IT'S CUSTOMIZED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BASED ON WHAT THEY NEED AND IT'S CHEAPER.
QUICK: AND ALL OF THESE THINGS WILL TAKE YOU HOW LONG TO IMPLEMENT? HOW LONG BEFORE A CUSTOMER HAS A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE WATCHING IT – WALKING INTO A CVS?
MERLO: BECKY, UPON CLOSING, THERE ARE THINGS THAT WELL BE ABLE TO DO, YOU KNOW, OUT OF THE GATE, AND AT THE SAME TIME WE'LL BEGIN TO PILOT THESE CONCEPTS. YOU KNOW, WE'LL LEARN FROM THEM, AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS YOU'LL SEE A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, THE STORE BEING NOT JUST ABOUT PRODUCTS, BUT ALSO SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE ON THEIR PATH TO BETTER HEALTH. IT WILL REALLY WORK AS A COMPLIMENT TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY, THE PHYSICIANS IN TERMS OF INSURING, YOU KNOW, THAT THOSE CONSUMERS ARE FOLLOWING THE CARE PLANS THAT THEIR PHYSICIANS HAVE LAID OUT FOR THEM.
QUICK: LARRY, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF REASONS THAT THIS MAKES SENSE FOR CVS. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE PRESSURE COMING AT THE FRONT END, THE RETAIL END FROM AMAZON, THE PRESSURE AT THE BACK END, THE PHARMACY BENEFITS MANAGERS, JUST FROM PEOPLE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO KIND OF CUT COSTS AND FOCUS ON THAT. IS THAT WHAT DROVE YOU TO LOOK FOR THIS, TOO?
MERLO: YOU KNOW, BECKY, IT'S REALLY ABOUT MEETING THIS UNMET NEED THAT MARK WAS TALKING ABOUT. YOU LOOK AT, YOU KNOW, THE HEALTH CARE ECONOMY IS NOW, WHAT, $3.5 TRILLION AND CONTINUING TO GROW AT WHAT EVERYONE RECOGNIZES AS AN UNSUSTAINABLE PACE. AND YOU KNOW, WE THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TO BEGIN TO BEND THAT COST CURVE, AND AT THE SAME TIME HELP PEOPLE ACHIEVE THEIR BEST HEALTH. YOU LOOK AT CHRONIC DISEASE IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY, ABOUT HALF OF ALL AMERICANS HAVE AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE CHRONIC DISEASES. IT'S ACCOUNTING FOR 80% OF THE HEALTH CARE COSTS.
QUICK: THAT STUNNED ME WHEN I HEARD THOSE NUMBERS. 80% OF THE COST.
MERLO: AND THERE'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR ON NECESSARY AND AVOIDABLE SPENDING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT FOLLOWING THOSE CARE PLANS. WE CAN MAKE A DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, GETTING PEOPLE BACK ON A PATH TO BETTER HEALTH.
QUICK: DO YOU WORRY ABOUT --
JOE KERNEN: NO, I WANT TO TALK ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS. JUST PHILOSOPHICALLY, THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, AND IN A WAY IT'S A POLITICAL FOOTBALL IN THE WAY THAT IT'S CHARACTERIZED. AND ONE THING TO REALIZE IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT PAY THAT PENALTY ARE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T AFFORD PREMIUMS WHERE THEY ARE RIGHT NOW, SO THEY PAY IT. THE OTHER SIDE IS GOING TO SAY – WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT, WE HAVE LARRY SUMMERS COMING ON AND HE SAYS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE NOW FROM WHAT'S IN THIS HEALTH CARE PLAN, BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN OBAMA CARE, I GUESS. WHAT'S THE ANSWER TO THIS? AND IT'S BEING DEMAGOGUED ON BOTH SIDES. ARE YOU GUYS IN FAVOR OF KEEPING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, OR IS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO DO THIS?
BERTOLINI: I THINK THE INDIVIDUALMANDATE IS CURRENTLY CONSTRUCTIVE, AND THE FINANCIAL STRUCTURE OF THE EXCHANGES DON'T WORK RIGHT NOW. SO I WOULD ARGUE THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE IS ALMOST AN IMMATERIAL ARGUMENT. WE NEED A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION. EVERY MAJOR PIECE OF SOCIAL LEGISLATION THAT WE'VE EVER PASSED IN THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN BIPARTISAN BECAUSE EVERY YEAR THEY NEED TO BE TWEAKED. HERE WE HAVE A BILL, THE ACA, THAT HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED FOR EIGHT YEARS. IF WE DIDN'T DO THAT WITH – IF WE DID THAT WITH MEDICARE AND DIDN'T TOUCH IT FOR EIGHT YEARS, IT WOULD FALL APART.
KERNEN: WHAT ARE THE CHANCE IT'S GOING TO BE TWEAKED INSTEAD OF JUST --
BERTOLINI: THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. THEY'RE TRYING THIS PIECE IN TAX REFORM. YOU GOT CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS ON MEDICARE. YOU'VE GOT THE BUDGET. THEY'RE ALL GOING TO DRIVE TWEAKING THIS.
QUICK: WHAT DOES THE SOLUTION LOOK LIKE?
BERTOLINI: THE SOLUTION LOOKS LIKE -- WHAT WE HAVE IN THE POOL TODAY IS WE HAVE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T JOIN. THEY'RE THE PEOPLE PAYING THAT PENALITY. BECAUSE THEY CAN DO MATH. WE KNOW OUR ARITHMETIC EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS IS WORKING WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS, ""I HAVE TO PAY A PREMIUM EVERY MONTH, AND I HAVE TO HAVE A $6,000 DEDUCTIBLE, AND WHEN I GO TO THE DOCTOR ONCE A YEAR I PAY CASH. SHOULD I DO THIS? NO."" BUT IF YOU PUT IN FRONT OF THEM A SUBSIDY, THE REPUBLICANS CALL IT THE ADVANCE REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT, WHERE YOU SAY YOU DON'T GET THIS UNLESS YOU JOIN AND WHEN YOU GET IT, YOU CAN PUT IT IN A HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT OR AN HSA THAT WILL -- CAN GROW TO $16,000 AS YOU AGE, YOU HAVE THIS POT OF MONEY THERE, AND THEN YOU GET YOUNGER PEOPLE IN. THAT WILL EQUALIZE THE POOL, AND THEN YOU HAVE A MORE FINANCIALLY STABLE ORGANIZATION.
QUICK: IS THAT THE TYPE OF THING WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THOUGH? I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT SOLUTION LAID OUT.
BERTOLINI: YOU HEARD IT FROM DIFFERENT PIECES FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MURRAY- ALEXANDRER BILL – IT STARTS TO APPROACH THAT. AND THAT'S A GOOD BIPARTISAN SOLUTION. SO I WOULD ARGUE, GET SOMETHING DONE BIPARTISAN.
QUICK: LET ME ASK BOTH OF YOU ABOUT WHETHER YOU EXPECT YOU'LL BE HEARING ANY COMPLAINTS FROM REGULATORS ON THIS FRON. I KNOW YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH IT WITH SIMILAR SITUATIONS, MARK, WITH TRYING TO DO AN INSURANCE DEAL, BUT NOW YOU HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOCUSSING ON AT&T AND TIME WARNER OVE R VERTICAL DEALS, HOW – DOES IT CONCERN YOU, AND HOW WOULD THAT POTENTIALLY IMPACT YOU?
BERTOLINI: WELL, BECKY, WE THINK THIS TRANSACTION IS HIGHLY COMPLIMENTARY. YOU THINK ABOUT THIS MORNING, AND WE'VE GOT A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE VALUE, YOU KNOW, FOR CONSUMERS AND PAYERS, AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PAYERS, THAT DOES INCLUDE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO SITTINGcDOWN WITH THE REGULATORS, TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HOW THIS COMES TO LIFE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY TO SEE THE BENEFITS, THE CONSUMERS, AND THE PAYERS CAN SEE FROM THIS TRANSACTION.
QUICK: WERE YOU SURPRISED WITH WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS LAID OUT THOUGH WITH AT&T AND TIME WARNER? I REALIZE IT'S A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY, BUT IN I SIMILAR WAY LOOKING AT VERTICAL MERGERS, PLACES THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN REGULATORS STEP IN IN THE PAST?
BERTOLINI: YEP, BECKY, I THINK IT'S HARD FOR US TO TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE TRANSACTIONS THAT MAY EXIST IN OTHER COMPANIES. BUT, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, YOU KNOW THIS VERTICAL INTEGRATION OF TWO TERRIFIC COMPANIES, YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT WE CAN DEMONSTRATE VALUE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY, YOU KNOW, WE THINK IS THE KEY TO YOU KNOW, GETTING ACROSS THE FINISH LINE.
QUICK: MARK, ARE YOU STAYING ON TO RUN AETNA? I WAS CONFUSED WHEN I WAS READING THROUGH THE PRESS RELEASE. IT SAID PEOPLE AT WHO ARE IN MANAGEMENT AT AETNA WOULD BE RUNNING THAT AS A SEPARATE UNIT. ARE YOU THAT PERSON?
BERTOLINI: SO I DEVELOPED A GREAT TEAM. THAT TEAM WILL TAKE OVER. WE NEED TO -- WE HAVE TWO COMPANIES. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT RETAIL. LARRY DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING – WELL A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HEALTH INSURANCE, I DON'T WANT TO SAY HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING – JUST SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON ONE. BUT WE NEED THE EXPERTISE OF BOTH ORGANIZATIONS TO COME TOGETHER, AND I WILL TAKE A SPOT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT CVS.
QUICK: BUT YOU WON'T BE RUNNING DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS?
BERTOLINI: I WILL NOT BE AN OPERATION'S LEADER.
MERLO: BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, BECKY, I AM GOING TO BE PICKING HIS BRAIN, AND I APPRECIATE THAT MARK IS GOING TO BE JOINING OUR BOARD, AND I CAN CERTAINLY BENEFIT FROM HIS EXPERTISE AND HIS VISION. AND, YOU KNOW, AS MARK MENTIONED, WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE AETNA AS A SEPARATE BUSINESS UNIT, AND IT WILL BE LED BY MEMBERS OF MARK'S TEAM.
QUICK: SO WHAT NEXT? WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP FOR YOU ALL IN TERMS OF THIS DEAL?
MERLO: YOU KNOW, THE NEXT STEP IS, YOU KNOW, EXECUTING AND BEGINNING THE INTEGRATION PROCESS, AND, YOU KNOW, SAYS BRINGING THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO LIFE SO THAT WE CAN CREATE THIS NEW HEALTH CARE PLATFORM AND MAKE IT EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO USE AND NAVIGATE, AT THE SAME TIME REDUCE COST SAND HELP THEM ACHIEVE THE BEST HEALTH POSSIBLE.
BERTOLINI: WE WANT TO PILOT THIS, BUT MY GOAL IS TO DELIVER A BETTER COMPANY THAN THE COMPANY LARRY THOUGHT HE BOUGHT.
KEN LANGONE: YOU KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE. AND I COMMEND YOU FOR THIS. HEALTH CARE OVER TIME IS BECOMING MORE SEAMLESS FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I GO GET AN EXAMPLE AND I NEED A CERTAIN DRUG, RIGHT THROUGH OUR SYSTEM INTO YOUR STORE -- BY THE WAY, I BUY ALL MY DRUGS, MY WIFE DOES TOO, AT CVS.
BERTOLINI: YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME EXTRA --
LANGONE: DON'T I LOOK HEALTHIER? YOU GOT A STORE ON 53rd AND LEX, AND YOU GOT ONE IN PALM BEACH – NORTH PALM BEACH. BUT I WATCH, AND I SAID THIS IS PRETTY GOOD BECAUSE I GET A CALL WHEN MY PRESCRIPTION IS DUE FOR REFILL. NOW, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS YOU HAVE WITH OLDER PEOPLE, GUYS LIKE ME, IS WE FORGET. WE DON'T WANT TO FORGET TO PICK UP A PRESCRIPTION. WE SOMETIMES FORGET TO TAKE THE PILL THAT DAY. SO ALL THE THINGS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT, I THINK ONE OF THE BIG PAY-OFFS IS GOING TO BE BETTER HEALTH CARE AND BETTER OVERSIGHT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED OVERSIGHT FOR THESE DRUGS THEY TAKE. SO LOOK, ITS GOING TO HAPPEN AND IT HAS TO HAPPEN.
KERNEN: IF YOU HAD TO CHARACTERIZE IT AS A DEFENSIVE MOVE OR AN OFFENSIVE MOVE, IS IT PUTTING TOGETHER -- I KNOW IT'S COMPLIMENTARY, BUT CAN YOU LEVERAGE WHAT BOTH COMPANIES HAVE OFFENSIVELY TO BE THE PLACE THAT TAKES ON AMAZON OR TAKES ON WAL-MART OR TAKES ON WHATEVER HEALTH CARE LOOKS LIKE IN FIVE YEARS? IS CVS-AETNA GOING TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT?
MERLO: YOU KNOW WHAT JOE, WE DO SEE THIS AS A GROWTH AND EXPANSION STORY FOR THE REASONS THAT WE'VE BEEN --
KERNEN: NOT DEFENSIVE NOT BECAUSE YOU SEE THREATS ON ALL SIDES?
MERLO: NOT DEFENSIVE. YOU KNOW, WE'RE -- WEVE TALKED ABOUT THE UNMET NEEDS THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE .YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK AT HEALTH CARE TODAY, AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND THE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE I'LL DESCRIBE IT AS INTERVENTION, THEY'RE MISSING THE CONVENIENCE, AND THAT'S THE UNMET NEED THAT WE THINK WE CAN CREATE WITH THIS NEW FRONT DOOR TO HEALTH CARE.
KERNEN: ALL WITH COST PRESSURES IN THE BACKGROUND TOO. I LOOK AT THE MEDIA LANDSCAPE AND WHAT THE INTERNET AND, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS GOING TO BE AHEAD IN TEN YEARS IS DAUNTING. AND I DONT THINK IT'S THAT DIFFERENT WITH HEALTH CARE ALSO, BECAUSE NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HEALTH CARE INFLATION AND TECHNOLOGY EVERYTHING –
QUICK: AND THE POTENTIAL LEGISLATION TOO.
KERNEN: NOW WE HAVE SENSORS ALL OVER THE PLACE SENDING OUR DATA TO WHEN YOU DIDN'T TAKE YOUR DRUG OR IT'S NOT WORKING, YOUR GLUCOSE LEVELS SUDDENLY SPIKE. IT'S GOING TO BE UNBELIEVABLE. AND I DON'T KNOW WHO I WANT – MAYBE CVS-AETNA – WHERE.
BERTOLINI: WHAT YOU WANT A TRUSTED RELATIONSHIP. SO, IF YOU HAVE A PLACE TO GO, MOST PEOPLE TO FIND THEIR HEALTH IS A BARRIER TO LIFE THEY WANT TO LIVE, AND THE UNMET NEED IS IT'S SO CONFUSING, HOW DO I FIGURE THIS OUT. BUT IF YOU HAVE A PLACE TO GO TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND WE BUILD THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU AND WE MAP IT OUT AND WE MAKE YOUR APPOINTMENTS, WE CLEAR YOUR PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS, MAYBE WE DON'T EVEN HAVE CLAIMS TO PAY, BECAUSE WE ARRANGED IT WITH THE NETWORK IN FRONT OF YOU AND IT'S AN EASIER JOURNEY THAT'S A DIFFERENT MODEL. THAT MEETS A NEED THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN MEET UNLESS THEY HAVE THIS ACCOMODATION. SO LOOKING OVER OUR SHOULDERS AT COMPETITORS SAYING WHAT ARE THE DOING NEXT IS NOT A WORTHWHILE EFFORT. IT HAS TO BE WHERE DO WE THINK WE NEED TO GO?
QUICK: WHAT DO YOU DO WITH EMPLOYERS LIKE OURS, COMCAST. WE USED TO BE AETNA, NOW WE'RE CVS, BUT NOW WE'RE UNITED HEALTH. IF YOU ARE USING ONE-HALF OF YOUR OPERATION BUT NOT THE OTHER HALF, WHAT HAPPENS?
BERTOLINI: IT'S OKAY THAT YOU MADE A MISTAKE EARLIER.
MERLO: I THINK THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY THAT WHEN YOU COMBINE THE TWO TOGETHER, THERE'S A SYNERGY THAT CAN BE CREATED. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK, ABOUT THE INFORMATION, THE ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES OF AETNA AND YOU COMBINE THE WITH CONVENIENCE AND FACE-TO-FACE INTERAKS OF CVS, THAT'S, AGAIN, ANOTHER WAY TO BRING TO LIFE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS MORNING.
KERNEN: SO WHEN YOU WAKE UP – DO YOU EVER WAKE UP AND, OH GOD, UNITED HEALTH CARE OR – DO YOU EVER WAKE UP AND THINK THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO EAT OUR LUNCH? WHO'S YOUR BIGGEST – AMAZON – WHO DO YOU WORRY ABOUT? WHO IS A REAL FORMIDABLE COMPETITOR FOR YOU?
MERLO: YOU KNOW WHAT JOE, WE HAVE TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS. MARK SAID IT BEST, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE FOCUS ON WHAT WE CAN DO? HOW DO WE FIND WHAT WHITE SPACE, THAT UNMET NEED, AND HOW DOES THAT BECOME OUR IT WORK FOR FILL THAT VOID, AND, KNOW, THE CUSTOMER DOESN'T -- IF WE LISTEN TO OUR CUSTOMERS CAREFULLY, WHICH WE SPEND A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME DOING, YOU KNOW, WE CAN HEAR THEIR FRUSTRATIONS, AND THEN IT'S OUR JOB TO COME BACK AND HOW DO WE SOLVE FOR THOSE FRUSTRATIONS, AND THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF THIS WAS ALL ABOUT.
QUICK: WHAT WAS THE FIRST CONVERSATION YOU TWO HAD IN TERMS OF COMBINING YOUR COMPANIES?
MERLO: I'LL LET YOU TAKE THAT ONE.
BERTOLINI: SO TWO YEARS AGO WE WERE JUST ABOUT TO DO THE HUMANA DEAL, AND LARRY AND I WERE HAVING DINNER AT PEPPERCORN'S IN HARTFORD AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME I DO SOMETHING TO SAVE – TO YOU KNOW, IMPROVE HEALTH, I LOSE REVENUE, AND YOU MAKE MONEY. AND I SAID YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG REVENUE MODEL. WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IF WE COULD SHARE RISK IN A WAY THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO BENEFIT YOU AS A RESULT AS WHAT YOU DO TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S HEALTH. AND THE NEXT TWO OR THREE DAYS WE SIGN THIS DEAL, AND IT WAS SORT OF LIKE, WE'LL SEE YOU WHEN WE GET DONE WITH THIS. I ALWAYS IMAGINE THIS RELATIONSHIP COMING TOGETHER, WHETHER OR NOT WE DID HUMANA. EVEN WITH HUMANA IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE POWERFUL. SO NOW WE'RE HERE. I THINK, YOU KNOW, LARRY AND I START TALKING ABOUT IT SERIOUSLY PROBABLY A YEAR AFTER THAT WE SAID HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN? WHAT WOULD IT TAKE? WHY WOULD WE DO IT? WE SHARED DATA BACK AND FORTH. YOU KNOW, EVERY 50 BASIS POINTS WE CHANGED TREND, IT'S $480 MILLION IN UNDERWRITING MARGIN FOR US AND OUR CUSTOMERS.
QUICK: LARRY, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT MOVES LIKE WHEN CVS GOT RID OF CIGARETTES. WERE THOSE THE TYPE OF MOVES THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT?
MERLO: THEY WERE YOU KNOW, IF YOU GO BACK, I THINK OUR JOURNEY PROBABLY GOES BACK A DECADE WITH CVS AND CAREMARK COMING TOGETHER. AND THROUGH THAT TIME, WE'VE CONTINUED TO ADD A CUSTOMER FACING HEALTH ASSETS, AND WE RECOGNIZE THE COMPLEXITIES ASSOCIATED THAT WENT TO THE DECISION BACK IN 2014 TO ELIMINATE THE SALE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS.
LANGONE: YOU KNOW, IF I COULD MAKE ONE CRITISISM OF HEALTH CARE COMPANIES. YOU KNOW, DRUG COMPANIES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, RETAILERS, THE INDUSTRY HAS DONE A TERRIBLE JOB OF BRAGGING ABOUT JUST HOW MUCH BETTER HUMAN BEINGS ARE BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. FROM DISCOVERY ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO WHAT I SAID WAS REMINDING PEOPLE TO KEEP TAKING THEIR DRUGS, INCLUDING IN YOUR FORMULA AND MORE AND MORE DRUGS THAT HAVE LIFE THAT ARE MORE EXPENSIVE. BUT YOU TAKE A STEP BACK, AND IT'S $15,000 OR $20,000 THAT THIS GUY IS GOING TO LIVE TO BE 90. HOW MUCH IS LIFE WORTH? IT'S PRECIOUS. I TELL THIS TO ALL THE GUYS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY, YOU HAVE DONE A HORRIBLE JOB POINTING OUT TO THE WORLD, JUST HOW MUCH BETTER. LOOK AT LIFE EXPECTANCY IN AMERICA. 80 YEARS AGO WE WERE AT 48? I'M 82. I'M NOT GOING TO STOP. NOW, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD WISH I STOP, AND THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT GOD MAKES ME STOP BUT THAT'S BESIDE -- THE POINT IS I THINK THE INDUSTRY COLLECTIVELY, ALL OF YOU IN IT, HAVE GOT TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF GETTING YOUR MESSAGE OUT THERE HOW MUCH YOU DO FOR MANKIND.
BERTOLINI: WE'RE 34th OUT OF 34 IN VALUE AMONG THE OECD NATIONS. WE'RE 11th WHEN YOU ADD TOGETHER HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SPENDING. WE'RE THE ONLY NATION OF THE OECD NATIONS THAT SPENDS 142% ON HEALTH CARE. WE SPEND 62%. EVERYBODY ELSE IS SPENDING MORE ON DETERMINATES – SOCIAL DETERMINATES, AND WE WONDER WHY WE HAVE AN OPIOID EPIDEMIC, WHERE 80% OF ALL THE O PIODS PRODUCED IN THE WORLD ARE CONSUMED BY AMERICANS. AND WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM. IT'S A LOSS OF HOPE, AND THERE'S A MALAISE AROUND THE LACK OF HEALTH BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM ISN'T GENERATING THE KIND OF RESULTS WE NEED TO GET.
KERNEN: WHAT HAPPENS WITH ANTHEM, HOW'S THAT GONNA WORK? 2020 IS THE DATE ON THE HORIZON, RIGHT?
MERLO: AND JOE, THIS ANNOUNCEMENT REALLY HAS NO BEARING IN TERMS OF THE CAPABILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO BRING TO THE ANTHEM BUSINESS. WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN THAT --
KERNEN: ARE YOU GOING TO STICK WITH THAT, EVEN IF YOU HAVE AETNA?
MERLO: JOE, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS COMBINATION IS THAT WHILE WE'RE STARTING HERE TO BUILD UP THESE CAPABILITIES, WE WANT TO MAKE THIS BROADLY AVAILABLE ACROSS THE INDUSTRY. I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. IT REALLY BEGINS TO BEND THIS HEALTH CARE COST CURVE THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. MARK SAID IT YESTERDAY, HE SAID IT VERY WELL. YOU KNOW, THE ABILITY TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT CUSTOMERS WANT TO COME AND USE, YOU KNOW, WE THINK THAT IS THE IMPORTANT ENABLER IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE THIS BROADLY AVAILABLE FOR ALL MUCH OUR CLIENTS AND PARTNERS.
KERNEN: WHAT WAS CVS'S TAX RATE LAST YEAR?
MERLO: ABOUT 39%.
QUICK: 39%?
BERTOLINI: 42.
QUICK: 42?
BERTOLINI: YEP.
KERNEN: U.S. COMPANIES DON'T PAY THE NOMINAL TAX RATE, THEY TELL ME. IN YOUR CASE YOU'RE PAYING MORE. THESE GUYS NEED NEW ACCOUNTANTS.
BERTOLINI: JOE, WE'VE BEEN CONSISTENT IN TERMS IT OF, YOU KNOW, THE IMPACT OF MEANINGFUL, YOU KNOW, COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM WILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS YOU KNOW, IMPACT IN TERMS OF OUR OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST.
KERNEN: GET MORE MONEY FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES.
MERLO: INVEST BACK --
KERNEN: USE IT WISELY. YES.
MERLO: CAPITAL. JOBS. INFRASTRUCTURE. AND BY THE WAY, IT WOULD CERTAINLY ALLOW US TO ACCELERATE SOME OF THE INVESTMENT THAT IS WERE TALKING ABOUT HERE THIS MORNING.
KERNEN: SO HAS THE 33% RISE IN THE DOW, I MEAN, IT'S NICE TO PARK STOCK TO MAKE THE ACQUISITION. A LOT OF TIMES YOU SEE MERGERS INCREASE WHEN THERE'S ANIMAL SPIRITS AND STOCK MARKET ACTIVITY. DOES THAT HELP? DOES THAT HELP GET YOU WHERE YOU ARE TODAY THAT THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT –
MERLO: I THINK IT IS AGAIN, YOU KNOW, I THINK THIS COMBINATION ENABLES US TO DO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT.
KERNEN: I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT ON THE BOTTOM LINE IF YOU ARE PAYING, WHAT DID YOU SAY, 42? --
MERLO: WE PAY -- CVS PAYS 1% OF ALL CORPORATE TAXES IN AMERICA.
KERNEN: HOW MUCH COMES RIGHT TO THE BOTTOM LINE IF THIS GOES THROUGH AT 20?
MERLO: THAT'S THE INTERESTING THING. THE FIRST YEAR THERE'S A LOT OF CAPITAL GENERATED. THEN YOU HAVE MINIMUM LOSS RATIOS, YOU HAVE ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE REGULATORED ENTITIES VERSUS UNREGULATED ENTITIES --. SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO WORK THROUGH.
MERLO: THE IMPORTANT THING BEING THAT WE WANT TO USE THOSE CAPABILITIES TO INVEST BACK INTO THE BUSINESS FOR GROWTH.
QUICK: RIGHT. GENTLEMEN, I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND HOW IN DEPTH YOU'VE BEEN WITH US. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
MERLO: THANKS FOR HAVING US.

 Disney-Fox, CVS-Aetna could revamp how investors see companies   
 7:03  PM ET Mon,  4 Dec 2017 |  01:05 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer has found that certain companies have started to ""change the narrative"" with strategic mergers and acquisitions when doubt falls on their well-being.
 ""Today we got two classic changes of narrative, one from Disney and the other from CVS Health,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said, referring to Disney's revived deal talks with Twenty-First Century Fox and CVS' $69 billion deal to buy health insurer Aetna.
If Disney and Fox's talks prove successful, Disney would acquire Fox's non-news, non-sports assets to bolster its entertainment offerings. CVS plans to integrate Aetna's network into its own to become a massive, one-stop shop for pharmacy benefits and clinical care.
 Cramer said that ""both are defensive deals,"" with Disney itching to get out from under its ESPN subscriber weakness and the cord-cutting fears that have plagued the old-line media giant.
""Even that shrewd acquisition of BAMTech, to give Disney what could be the best seamless sports experience from television to the internet, hasn't mattered,"" Cramer said. ""It seems like if you're rooted in old media, the market won't accept your forays into so-called new media.""
CVS, on the other hand, needed to prove itself in the age of Amazon. Until news of the Aetna deal emerged, the company was widely viewed as being ""left in the dust"" by the rest of the drugstore cohort.
By acquiring Aetna, ""CVS becomes a true health care business with a brick-and-mortar kicker,"" Cramer said. ""In one fell swoop, CVS would go from a low-multiple retailer to a high-multiple health care company that's no longer shadow-boxing with Amazon.""
Cramer said the CVS-Aetna combination could create a more health-conscious retailer with less junk food products, like when CVS bought pharmacy benefits manager Caremark and stopped selling cigarettes.
A Disney-Fox deal would give Disney a heap of successful film and television assets and boost its overseas footprint, ideally giving Disney better growth prospects.
Better yet, both deals would serve to change the stock market's view of the businesses, lifting CVS out of ""retail purgatory"" and muting Disney's ESPN woes, Cramer said.
""We know most acquisitions are done for scale and cost cuts. But sometimes, you buy another business to change the whole image of your company, and that's the theme of both these deals,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""And when they're completed, the stocks will run. The regulators may dally, but investors probably won't wait, as the future prospects for Disney and CVS, to me, ... look a lot more rosy and attractive.""

 Former Aetna CEO: Here's what triggered CVS to buy Aetna   
 5:27  PM ET Mon,  4 Dec 2017 |  03:20 
 There are three things that are triggering the CVS-Aetna deal and one of them is Amazon, former Aetna CEO John Rowe told CNBC on Monday.
 CVS Health will acquire Aetna for about $69 billion in cash and stock, the two companies announced on Sunday.
The deal would combine CVS' pharmacy business and pharmacy-benefit-manager platform (PBM) with Aetna's insurance business.
 ""Both of these companies are trying to increase their footprint in health care,"" Rowe said in an interview with ""Closing Bell.""
The deal comes as ecommerce giant Amazon looks to enter the industry, holding preliminary talks with generic-drug makers. 
""It's not quite explicit yet what they're planning on doing but whatever it is, it's scaring CVS,"" Rowe said about Amazon.
Another thing spurring the deal is United Healthcare, which ""has had some success with their integrated model of a payer provider,"" he added.
Lastly, he thinks the failure of recent horizontal mergers, like Aetna-Humana deal, has forced companies to think more vertically across sectors to increase their footprint.
The CEOs of Aetna and CVS both told CNBC on Monday that the merger will reduce health-care costs for consumers immediately. 
Rowe believes there are two areas that will see costs reduced — at the point of care at CVS Minute Clinics and in premiums.
""The infusion of millions of Aetna members into CVS program is going to give them more leverage with the drug wholesalers,"" he said.

26,2018-02-01,Justice Department requests more information on CVS-Aetna merger  ,"Cameron Costa | CNBC
Larry Merlo, CEO of CVS and Mark Bertolini, CEO of AETNA appear on Squawk Box on Dec. 4th, 2017.
 Trump administration regulators are not ready to sign off on CVS Health's $69 billion deal to acquire Aetna. The Department of Justice asked the firms to provide more information on Thursday, just as the 30 day waiting period under Hart Scott Rodino Act expired.
 ""CVS Health and Aetna have been cooperating with the DOJ staff since shortly after the announcement of the Merger Agreement and are continuing to cooperate with the DOJ staff in its review of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,"" the firms said in an SEC regulatory filing.
CVS aims to merge with Aetna to create an integrated health system combines pharmacy and health benefits, and delivers preventive care services through the drugstore chain's retail clinics. It would mark a major effort at vertical consolidation in health care.
 The Obama administration opposed major horizontal mergers by health insurers over the last couple of years, blocking Aetna's proposed deal to acquire rival Humana and Anthem's bid to buy Cigna.
So far, the Trump administration has shown it's not receptive to vertical integration deals. Last fall, the justice department moved to block AT&T's bid to acquire Time Warner.That trail in that case is set to start on March 19th.
The DOJ's second notice request extends the waiting period on the CVS-Aetna deal for another 30 days. In the meantime, the firms have scheduled shareholder votes to approve the deal for March 20th.

27,2018-02-08,CVS still expects Aetna deal to close in the second half of the year  ,"CNBC
CVS CEO Larry Merlo and AETNA CEO Mark Bertolini.
 CVS Health still expects its $69 billion acquisition of Aetna to close in the second half of the year despite the Department of Justice's request for more information. 
 The two want to create an integrated health system that combines pharmacy and health benefits while delivering preventive care services through the drugstore chain's retail clinics. 
Last week, the DOJ asked the firms to provide more information on the proposed deal, just as the 30-day waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Act expired. But CVS CEO Larry Merlo said its original timetable built in that request and ""things are moving along as planned."" 
 ""In addition, the integration planning just begun, and we have assembled a team with representatives from both companies and are very pleased with how the planning process is progressing,"" Merlo said on a call following the release of CVS' fourth-quarter results. 
Shareholders are slated to vote on the deal on March 20.
CVS' stock fell about 5 percent and Aetna's dipped about 2 percent on Thursday.
