0,2017-02-17,"Apple has teamed up with Broadcom to build wireless charging for iPhone, says JPMorgan analyst  ","Mark Neuling | CNBC  
iPhone 7
 An upcoming Apple iPhone is likely to have a customized wireless charging system made with Broadcom, according to JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur. 
 The wireless charging partnership between Apple and chip giant Broadcom — ""a key enabler of Apple's best-in-class performance""— has been going on for about two years, Sur wrote in a research note released Friday. But Sur said this feature may not come out on the next iPhone, because of caution around the battery-related recall of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7.

 Still, Sur's prediction falls in line with other predictions for the next iPhone. Top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects all three iPhones released this year will have wireless charging, and Apple confirmed to CNBC on Monday that it has joined the Wireless Power Consortium. 
 Wireless charging also makes sense alongside rumors that the next iPhone will be mostly glass. 
""We believe the glass back cover is conducive to wireless charging as it reduces signal interference versus a metal casing,"" Sur wrote. ""It is possible for Apple to add proprietary features such as fast charging or extended charging to differentiate itself from the pack andenhance the value of its own hardware ecosystem."" 
Apple, which typically doesn't weigh in on speculation about new products, declined to comment to CNBC. 
Sur estimated that iPhone charging upgrade could grow to a $500 million to $600 million opportunity for Broadcom. Broadcom's shares closed 1 percent higher on Friday.

 New iPhone to charge wirelessly   
 3:03  PM ET Tue,  2 May 2017 |  00:51 
 Apple's next iPhone will support wireless charging, JPMorgan said in a note Tuesday.
 JPMorgan's note focused on Broadcom but said the company's new wireless charging chip will be included in the next iPhone. The firm didn't say which models will pack the new functionality, though KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said earlier this year that all of Apple's new iPhones, including the expected iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8 will offer wireless charging capabilities.
JPMorgan didn't specifically identify which wireless charging standard the new iPhone chips will support — Qi and PMA are the two main competitors in the space — though Broadcom sells chips that support both.
 Earlier this year, however, Apple joined the Wireless Power Consortium, which backs the Qi standard. That doesn't necessarily mean Apple will support only Qi. Samsung is also a member of the consortium, and its Galaxy smartphones support Qi and PMA.
Broadcom's stock was up slightly in premarket trading Tuesday.
JPMorgan also said Apple's new iPhones will support Bluetooth 5.0, which allows Bluetooth accessories, such as headphones and speakers, to work at longer distances from an iPhone. It also allows multiple Bluetooth devices to be used at the same time. Theoretically, if Apple enables it, two users could watch a movie on an iPhone with two sets of Bluetooth headsets.
JPMorgan said Broadcom's ""wireless charging win could add $500-$600M of annualized revenues to Broadcom's wireless business.""

 Broadcom is seen as the preferred buyer for Toshiba's flash business, sources told CNBC on Friday. 
 But the Japanese government is trying to put together a group that will keep the business under a Japanese owner, and is influencing the chip sale process, sources said. There's an expectation of a deal by the end of the month, sources said.
Toshiba had been expected to name a winner for the chip business next week. Sources previously told Reuters the choice has narrowed to one bid from Broadcom and U.S. tech fund Silver Lake and another from Toshiba chip partner Western Digital and Japanese government-related investors.
 A joint venture with Western Digital has reportedly complicated the process of selling the $18 billion business.
The Japanese company has been in flux, after delaying its financial reports and struggling to sell its nuclear unit. Broadcom shares were little-changed on the report of a potential deal with Toshiba.
Toshiba was not immediately available to comment on the report. Broadcom declined to comment.

 Broadcom has backed away from a $20 billion bid for Toshiba's memory chip business, sources said.
 Toshiba announced Wednesday it had selected a consortium led by the public-private Innovation Network Corp. of Japan (INCJ) as a preferred bidder. Other members of the consortium include Bain Capital Private Equity and the Development Bank of Japan.
Chipmaker rival Broadcom had lined up a fully financed bid, sources said, but backed away after Western Digital took legal action to block Toshiba's sale of the business, the sources said. Western Digital and Toshiba jointly operate a semiconductor plant in Japan.
 The sources said Broadcom would continue to monitor Western Digital's lawsuit.
In a statement, Toshiba said Wednesday it determined that the consortium ""presented the best proposal, not only in terms of valuation, but also in respect to certainty of closing, retention of employees, and maintenance of sensitive technology within Japan.""

 Broadcom shares are poised for a boost because the chip maker recently had big design wins, including components for the next iPhone, said a JPMorgan analyst in reiterating his overweight rating.

Broadcom should beat estimates by JPMorgan and the rest of Wall Street on revenue, margins, earnings per share and free cash flow, wrote analyst Harlan Sur in a note to JPMorgan clients on Tuesday.

15,2017-09-12,Chip stocks like Broadcom and Micron could see a boost from Tuesday's Apple event  ,"Kai Pfaffenbach | Reuters
 A slew of chip stocks is likely headed for gains after Apple's product launch Tuesday, JPMorgan predicts.
 With many investors expecting significant developments in the next generation of iPhone, JPMorgan listed some of the companies likely to see shares jump, including Apple's rising chip technology partner, Broadcom.
""As we have discussed in prior research, we expect Broadcom to benefit from increased dollar content in the forthcoming iPhone models, including the new OLED version that we expect to use Broadcom's touch control technology,"" wrote JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur.
 ""In total, Broadcom has pointed to a 40% increase in blended content in the new iPhone models, and we believe the company's non-RF content [wireless charging, touch controller, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, GPS] is increasing by $3-$4 per iPhone versus last year's models.""
The relationship between Apple and Broadcom has been hot lately, generating much attention from Wall Street analysts in the run-up to what is expected to be a major upgrade for the iPhone. Sur previously noted that the wireless charging partnership between Apple and Broadcom — ""a key enabler of Apple's best-in-class performance""— has been going on for about two years.
Apple's new product presentation is set to start around 1 p.m. ET.
""We believe Broadcom is a leader in wireless communications, enterprise storage, networking, and broadband with broad-based exposure to positive trends,"" wrote Sur, reiterating his overweight rating.
While Broadcom may make headlines, JPMorgan also highlighted antenna and radio frequency provider Qorvo. The company's mobile segment supplies radio solutions that provide a wide variety of functions in the cellular radio space for major phone manufacturers and could stand to reap big gains if Apple's product launch is a success.
Qorvo is already up a whopping 38 percent since January. Seth Klarman, the value investing giant who draws comparisons to Warren Buffett, purchased a large stake earlier this year. Klarman's hedge fund, Baupost, acquired 7.2 million shares of Qorvo worth $493 million, according to the March quarter 13F filing.
Strong iPhone demand would benefit memory players like Micron Technology as well, which supplies phones with types of random access memory (RAM).
""Micron and other industry participants should benefit from increased DRAM demand (unit demand and potential increases in content per phone) from Apple in 2H17 and into 2018,"" Sur said. ""We anticipate Micron benefitting from the new iPhone launches and remind investors that the iPhone 7+ contained 3GB of DRAM vs. 2G of DRAM for the iPhone 7 and prior iPhone versions.""

 Move over 'FANG' stocks, now there's 'FAAANG'   
 6:20  PM ET Mon,  2 Oct 2017 |  00:40 
 Hold on ""FANG"" stocks: Bank of American Merrill Lynch just added two more names to the popular simple portfolio after finding multiple stocks that share their tremendous growth potential. You can now call it ""FAAANG.""
 Strategist Savita Subramanian added Broadcom, with its ticker 'AVGO,' and Adobe (ADBE) to the popular Wall Street acronym after screening large-cap technology stocks for ones with similar features.
Just like the original FANG list, her additions include stocks that have sales growth of 20 percent or higher, expected long-term growth rates of 15 percent or higher, and market cap over $65 billion, according to the strategist.
 The original FANG of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) was created and popularized by CNBC's Jim Cramer.
The stocks have had high-flying market success and lofty valuations, making them easy targets for skittish profit-takers should the stock market turn sour. But the companies have also posted continued sales growth and corresponding share price growth, making them enticing opportunities for investors.
The original FANG stocks are all up over 20 percent since January, with Facebook leading the group with a 48 percent year-to-date share price climb. But Adobe and Broadcom have also notched sizable gains, up 36 percent and 44 percent respectively.
The strategist also noted that the short interest on the FAAANG group is near a record low of 0.9 percent.
Short interest is the quantity of stock shares that investors have sold short but not yet covered or closed out. It is often used as a sentiment indicator that tells whether investors believe a stock's price is likely to fall.
To be sure, the crowding in tech may not be bullish for the sector looking ahead.
""Over the last several years, buying the most underweight stocks and selling the most overweight stocks has consistently generated alpha, although performance in 2017 so far has bucked the trend,"" the strategist explained. ""Historically, large Core mutual funds have had a bias toward smaller cap stocks within the benchmark – reasons include that it requires more dollars allocated to be overweight a mega-cap stock than a mid-cap stock.""
Alpha is defined as the excess return of a portfolio relative to a market benchmark's performance.

 These semiconductor stocks can still soar   
 6:48  PM ET Tue, 10 Oct 2017 |  01:00 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer knows that a juggernaut stock market can be instrumental in sending technology stocks soaring.
 ""That goes double for the semiconductor space, the chipmakers that make big-picture themes like autonomous driving, internet of things, artificial intelligence, mobile, gaming [and] the data center ... possible,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Strength in the semis signals that consumers are willing to spend more money on all sorts of devices, which is why this group can be such a terrific leader, especially during economic expansion like we have around the globe.""
Technician Bob Lang, the founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and one of the three brains behind TheStreet.com's Trifecta Stocks newsletter, pointed out to Cramer that the semiconductor cohort has been surging higher for years.
 Since the market bottomed in March 2009, the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF has run 1200 percent, a monster gain relative to the S&P 500's almost-300 percent gain over the same period.
And the move is widespread, not just driven by powerhouse stocks like Nvidia, Cramer said. So he turned to Lang's charts to track some other strong semiconductor names.
First, Cramer looked at Intel, an old-line chipmaker that has soared to its highest levels since the dotcom bubble burst in 2000.
 Since the Chaikin Money Flow Oscillator, which measures the buying and selling pressure in a given stock, turned positive three weeks ago, Intel's stock has skyrocketed.
Lang interpreted this action as institutional investors buying up shares of Intel, and Cramer liked his assessment.
""When these hedge funds and mutual funds anoint a stock as a winner and decide to buy it hand over fist, you better believe you're going to get a higher share price. At the end of the day, institutional buying is what's driving stocks higher. Intel is Exhibit A,"" Cramer said.
Given how much Intel's stock has run ahead of its earnings report next week, Cramer said any pullback after the company reports will give investors a buying opportunity.
Not all of the semiconductor stocks have been out-performers. Qualcomm, which makes communications chips and mobile technology, has been lagging for most of 2017, but could be on the brink of a turnaround, Cramer said.
 Lang noticed Qualcomm's stock forming an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which Cramer sees as one of the most reliably bullish patterns out there.
Now that Qualcomm has broken above the pattern's ""neckline,"" surpassed its $53 ceiling of resistance and is picking up momentum according to a slew of indicators, Lang said the stock could reach $56 a share in the near future.
Some buyers are betting that, if earnings and Qualcomm's deal to buy NXP Semiconductor serve the company well, the stock could even hit $60 by the end of the year.
Finally, Cramer turned to the weekly chart of Broadcom. Through a series of acquisition, the longtime Cramer-fave has become a semiconductor giant.
 Lang has watched Broadcom making a series of higher highs and higher lows. Recently, the stock formed a bullish flag pattern by trading sideways for a while after its big rally, a trend that often leads to a breakout to the upside.
Lang said that if Broadcom's shares can rally above $250, it should be smooth sailing to $300.
 Final Thoughts
 ""The charts, as interpreted by Bob Lang, suggest that Intel's got more upside — although it would be even better after a pullback — while Qualcomm's stock might finally be getting it together, and Broadcom could be ready for another big move after a long-term breather,"" Cramer said. ""Now, I think he's got a point. I agree with him on Intel. I'm hopeful about Broadcom. Qualcomm's got a tougher road to hoe because it's got a long-running patent dispute with Apple.""

 Broadcom is looking into an unsolicited bid to acquire Qualcomm for more than $100 billion,  according to sources. 
 Broadcom is talking with advisors about a potential deal, which would be the biggest ever takeover of a chipmaker.
Bloomberg News first reported the deal, saying an unsolicited bid could be for around $70 a share. That would give Qualcomm a market value of $103.2 billion. The deal price was later confirmed by sources of CNBC.
 Dow Jones reported Broadcom plans to make a bid for Qualcomm as early as this weekend.
Shares of Broadcom closed up 5.5 percent Friday after the report, while Qualcomm's stock surged 12.7 percent.
Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Qualcomm had no comment.

 Wall Street is buzzing over Broadcom's blockbuster unsolicited $70 per share offer to buy Qualcomm, which values the chipmaker at more than $130 billion including debt.
 If completed, the deal would be the largest technology acquisition on record, according to Dealogic.
 The size of the deal also ranks as the third biggest overall since 1995, the research firm added.
 Shares of Qualcomm rose 2.3 percent midday Monday following the bid announcement, while Broadcom's stock was roughly flat.
Qualcomm rose 12.7 percent Friday, when reports of a potential bid from Broadcom were first released.

 Value in the Broadcom-Qualcomm more than analysts realize   
 6:51  PM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  01:06 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to explain why stocks were at record highs after Broadcom offered to buy Qualcomm for $103 billion in the largest deal the technology sector has ever seen.
 ""[The deal] has sent shock waves through the whole tech sector,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The thing about technology is that many skeptics just don't understand how the industry has gotten so much bigger, which means these companies are a lot more valuable to each other than you might think.""
Cramer said that the ""bombshell"" factor of Broadcom's takeover bid came largely from the fact that it was hostile, which is unusual for the tech space.
 But Broadcom, which provides the most Apple smartphone components than any company in the world, might not see this deal completed, the ""Mad Money"" host continued.
""The odds of this deal actually being completed seem pretty long,"" Cramer said. ""Qualcomm's stock has been held back by its squabble with Apple. Its board of directors knows that the share price would probably be worth more than where it's currently trading and they don't want to give the company away.""
But if Apple wins the companies' prolonged legal battle, Cramer said that Qualcomm's shareholders would likely be more open to Broacom's offer, no matter the price.
And Cramer was behind the reasoning for the deal.
""Put simply, as in many other industries, we have too many semiconductor companies and they're competing for too little business. But if you can combine companies, you end up saving money while building up more bargaining power with your customers, and that's a win,"" he said.
Cramer added that bearish analysts and market-watchers who claim that the market's ""done for"" are often making claims solely from earnings estimates, not takeover values, which Cramer said tend to paint a better picture of strategic worth.
""[The deal shows] you the worth of these chipmakers beyond simply what we're willing to pay for their earnings per share,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Analysts have earnings models. [Broadcom CEO] Hock Tan, for instance, has franchise models, and that's why he wants to buy Qualcomm.""
Tech, particularly the semiconductor space, has become about so much more than smartphone and personal computer chips, Cramer argued.
With industrial automation and machine learning on the rise, companies now need semiconductors for more applications than many people on Wall Street even consider, he said.
""The skeptics want to judge stocks based on their price-to-earnings multiples, which seem to get more expensive by the day. But when you look at companies the way CEOs and entrepreneurs do, as takeover targets, then there's a lot more value in this market than you might think if you only looked at a spreadsheet,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Don't get me wrong, on an earnings basis, stocks have definitely come too far, but in the real world, there's much more than one way to value a company: the cost of buying all the shares, not just a percent of the shares like a regular money manager would. And right now, merger potential is driving this market as much as anything else.""

 Qualcomm expected to reject Broadcom's 'hostile' bid: CNBC's David Faber   
 9:01  AM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  03:06 
 Broadcom on Monday made an unsolicited offer to buy Qualcomm, in a deal that would be the largest technology acquisition ever.
 The $70 a share bid is comprised of $60 in cash and $10 per share in stock, which would value Qualcomm at $103 billion. It also includes Broadcom's willingness to have Qualcomm complete its pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors for more than $38 billion in cash, sources told CNBC.
But the bid stands whether that acquisition is completed or not, Broadcom said.

 Broadcom makes unsolicited bid for Qualcomm in largest tech deal in history   
 7:45  AM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  03:33 
 Qualcomm shares rose 4 percent to $64.43 a share in premarket trading. The deal's total value is $130 billion when including $25 billion in net debt.
The stock, traded on the Nasdaq, surged by more than 12 percent on Friday amid speculation that Broadcom was preparing a bid. It finished the session at $61.81. Broadcom's offer is at a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm's closing price of $54.84 on Thursday, a day before media reports of a potential deal pushed up the company's shares.
Broadcom has been working on its proposal for months —  a bold bid to become a dominant supplier of communications chips to the wireless industry — and is believed to have approached Qualcomm privately about its offer, but was quickly rebuffed, sources told CNBC. The company had originally considered an attempt to buy Qualcomm prior to that company's deal to buy NXP more than one year ago, but upon getting no traction at that time, retreated.

Qualcomm Inc. CEO Steve Mollenkopf.
 This time, Broadcom is determined to bring its offer to the attention of Qualcomm shareholders. People familiar with the company's thinking indicate Broadcom will not shy away from initiating a proxy fight to gain seats on Qualcomm's board of directors in support of its offer.
Qualcomm's annual meeting is currently scheduled for March with the deadline for nominating directors sometime in December.
The chipmaker confirmed Monday morning that it received the Broadcom offer and said in a statement, ""Qualcomm Board of Directors, in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, will assess the proposal in order to pursue the course of action that is in the best interests of Qualcomm shareholders.""
Qualcomm, however, is expected to strongly resist Broadcom's proposal. People close to the company expect it to indicate the offer price is far below what it would expect in a takeover. In addition, Qualcomm is expected to raise concerns that any combination with Broadcom would raise significant antitrust concerns.
While Broadcom is expected to indicate its willingness to let Qualcomm complete its deal to acquire NXP, it is also expected to encourage the company not to raise its current $110 per share cash deal to acquire the company. Qualcomm is under pressure from NXP shareholders to raise its bid for that chip company, or face the likely prospect it will not be able to meet the minimum threshold needed to take control of the company under Dutch law.
A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raise the stakes for Intel, which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.

Qualcomm Inc. CEO Steve Mollenkopf.
 Even if Qualcomm declines Broadcom's $103 billion buyout bid, shares of the chipmaker still have plenty of ways of climbing higher over the next year, according to one Wall Street analyst.
 RBC Capital Markets upgraded Qualcomm shares to outperform from sector perform Tuesday, with a $70 price target, noting that Broadcom's recent bid implied the stock could gain another 10 percent. But ""with or without"" Broadcom, analyst Amit Daryanani contends the stock could still gain over the next year.
""The probability of the initial unsolicited bid becoming the final bid is low and therefore think there is an upside narrative here,"" wrote Daryanani in a note to clients. But even ""if QCOM board rejects the offer, we think the roadmap for value creation is fairly distinct.""
 Qualcomm shares have risen roughly 17 percent since Friday, when reports of a potential bid from Broadcom first surfaced.
 The $70 per share cash and stock offer would be the largest technology acquisition ever. 
Shares of Qualcomm were up 1.4 percent Wednesday.
But even without a deal, Daryanani believes the company can grow on its own. Qualcomm's deal with NXP Semiconductors is expected to close within the next few months, adding $1.20 to earnings per share. Qualcomm announced that it agreed to buy NXP for about $38 billion last year, as it seeks to expand the reach of its chips from phones to cars.
Improving relations with Apple would also bode well for Qualcomm, which supplies chips for the iPhone. The two companies have been locked in a multinational legal battle throughout the year; Apple teed off the dispute in January by suing Qualcomm for $1 billion for excessive royalties.
""Our investment thesis assumes Qualcomm and Apple should be able to resolve the dispute in calendar year 2018, possibly with Qualcomm offering some level of concessions,"" added the analyst. ""Should Apple and Qualcomm settle the dispute, we believe payments from Apple will resume and Qualcomm should expect catch-up payments from Apple as well.""

 GE has the worst record when it comes to takeovers   
 7:25  PM ET Mon, 13 Nov 2017 |  01:15 
 Usually, CNBC's Jim Cramer is a big fan of corporate takeovers.
 ""When one company buys another, it can create so much value that you want to slap yourself in the face, wondering why the heck they didn't merge years ago,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Then there's the pin action: whenever you get a deal, it tends to boost the value of all stocks in the same sector, which in turn drives up the entire market.""
That's why Cramer was so bullish on Hasbro's offer to buy competing toymaker Mattel, which was reported by the Wall Street Journal over the weekend.
 Not only would the deal create plenty of powerful synergies, but it would be a smart move by Hasbro, which would be taking advantage of Mattel's declines after the Toys R Us bankruptcy, he said.
Or take the now-dissolved deal between semiconductor giants Broadcom and Qualcomm, which was unanimously rejected by Qualcomm's board on Monday.
Cramer agreed with the board's reasoning — that the $103 billion bid undervalued Qualcomm — but said he would advise holding shares of Qualcomm in case its dispute with Apple ended sourly and the Broadcom ""safety net"" would have to be put to use.
But then there's the fallen-from-grace General Electric, a company Cramer said has ""become the poster child for bad acquisitions.""
Shares of GE tanked 7 percent on Monday after the industrial giant announced a company overhaul replete with a 50 percent dividend cut and slashed guidance.
Not long after on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street,"" Cramer called his investment in GE ""one of the biggest mistakes of my career.""
After all, GE spent billions buying into the energy and power markets at their peaks, Cramer said. At the same time, it sold NBC to Comcast and let go of some solid financial businesses.
""It's like they were deliberately trying to get everything wrong,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
That said, Cramer had some faith in GE's new CEO, John Flannery, who vowed on Monday to sell parts of the company to raise money and bring new faces to the board of directors, which was partially accountable for many of GE's unsuccessful decisions.
""Is GE the stock a buy down here? That's a rough one. Flannery said today that next year is a 'massive heavy lift.' I don't know, I don't like to lift massively,"" Cramer said.
But if Flannery is at all successful in his major restructuring plans, Cramer said the stock would end up being too cheap to ignore.
""But Flannery has to act fast. There can be no sacred cows. No more hype. No more unfulfilled promises,"" Cramer said. ""Out-of-control expenses must be reduced, divisions have to be separated, and, if necessary, GE may need to to disappear. Why? ... Because the previous management wrecked this once great American industrial.""
""I often talk about how important management is to the value of a company,"" the ""Mad Money"" host continued. ""But if you want to know the damage bad management can do to an enterprise, just look at GE, the only industrial of this whole era that's actually gone backwards during a renaissance of American manufacturing.""

 Broadcom finalizing candidates for full Qualcomm: Sources   
 11:10  AM ET Tue, 28 Nov 2017 |  02:39 
 Broadcom is finalizing candidates for a full slate of candidates to join Qualcomm's board, sources told CNBC.
 The deadline to nominate is Dec. 8. Qualcomm has 11 directors right now, and Broadcom's nominee list to replace them could come out next week, the sources said.
Broadcom is keeping its options open after Qualcomm rejected its unsolicited $103 billion takeover bid earlier this month. At the time, Broadcom said it would engage with Qualcomm's board and management. A deal between the two would unite two of the biggest makers of chips used in mobile phones.

 Microsoft, Google concerned about Broadcom/Qualcomm deal   
 7:46  PM ET Fri,  8 Dec 2017 |  01:48 
 Microsoft and Google are among companies that have expressed private concerns to Qualcomm about a Broadcom takeover, according to people familiar with the matter.
 The companies are wary of Apple's potential influence over a deal, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. They're also worried about Broadcom's reputation of cutting costs rather than investing in new technology, the people said.
Qualcomm rejected a hostile $105 billion bid last month, leading to Broadcom nominating a new slate of board directors for the San Diego-based company earlier this week. Regulators frequently ask for industry input when making a judgment on whether or not to approve a deal. Qualcomm has said it has antitrust concerns about a potential Broadcom takeover.
 Qualcomm has told Microsoft, Google and other companies not to make any public statements  opposing a deal, said the sources. Qualcomm wants to find out if Broadcom will significantly increase its $70-per-share offer before taking a firmer stance against a possible deal, said the people. 
A Broadcom transaction for Qualcomm may improve Apple's relationship with the chipmaker, which currently provides chips used in the iPhone and iPad.  Qualcomm is suing Apple for patent infringement after Apple in January sued Qualcomm for roughly $1 billion, claiming Qualcomm charged royalties improperly. Qualcomm has issued and applied more than 130,000 patents covering, among other things, smartphone technology.
The litigation could result in Apple abandoning Qualcomm for future products. 
But Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan has privately expressed optimism about settling an ongoing litigation with Apple if Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm, according to a person familiar with the matter.
 Why Microsoft and Google would object
 Apple's gain could be its competition's loss. 
In Google's case, many of the phone and tablet makers who build phones on its market-leading Android operating system use Qualcomm processors. Android and its derivatives make up 85 percent of the smartphone market, according to IDC.
Microsoft just announced the first Windows 10 PCs using Qualcomm chips, and it may continue to push these types of tablet and hybrid PCs, which use less power than traditional Intel-based PCs, as it seeks to compete with Apple's iPad. 
While Microsoft and Google are two of the largest companies in the world, neither rival Apple or Samsung in terms of sales volume from either Qualcomm or Broadcom. Still, both Microsoft and Google perceive an independent Qualcomm as being more closely aligned with their interests than a Broadcom-owned Qualcomm that is tighter with Apple.
The companies have also privately expressed concerns with Tan's reputation of cutting costs at the expense of increasing spending on innovation, two of the people said.
Complaints from these third parties could play a role in scuppering the deal. In the press release announcing the proposed buyout, Tan said ""We would not make this offer if we were not confident that our common global customers would embrace the proposed combination.""
Spokespeople for Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Google declined to comment. A spokesperson for Microsoft couldn't be reached for comment.

35,2017-12-12,More American Jobs? Broadcom Deal Might Mean the Opposite  ,"Getty Images
President Donald Trump introduces Broadcom CEO Hock Tan prior to Tan announcing the repatriation of his company's headquarters to the United States from Singapore during a ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, DC, November 2, 2017.
 Last month, President Trump stood in the Oval Office under a portrait of Andrew Jackson and announced that Broadcom, a semiconductor company based in Singapore, would be moving its headquarters back to the United States.
""I want to thank you very much for choosing us,"" Mr. Trump said, boasting that Broadcom already had 7,500 workers in the United States and noting that some of those workers, from a plant in Pennsylvania, were standing behind him. ""We're looking forward to seeing that number grow very substantially, which it is now anticipated to do.""
He added that he was thrilled to see Broadcom's $20 billion in revenues ""come back to our cities, towns and American workers.""
 More from the New York Times:  Qualcomm Merger Calculus Complicated by Activist InvestorHSBC Says US Is Preparing to Dismiss Criminal Charges Against ItAs Brexit Looms, Paris Tries a Business Makeover
Broadcom's chief executive, Hock Tan, then took the podium and declared: ""Thanks to you, Mr. President, business conditions have steadily improved."" He praised the president's proposed tax overhaul as a policy that would ""level the global playing field'' and make a move to the United States more advantageous.
It was an impressive story line. The president was able to get a big headline for bringing a foreign company back to the United States and Broadcom was able to capture the loyalty of an important ally, all with the Oval Office as a backdrop.
Yet it was only theater.
Within 24 hours — for those paying attention — Broadcom's real motivation emerged: The company was planning to mount a $100 billion bid for the rival chip maker Qualcomm in what would amount to the largest hostile takeover of a technology company in history.
The reason for Broadcom's sudden move back to the United States was clear: Given President Trump's aversion to foreign companies, there was no way that Broadcom would ever receive regulatory approval for a takeover of one of the crown jewels of Silicon Valley if it were based anywhere but here. After all, Qualcomm's chips are inside virtually every major American device, starting with Apple's iPhone.
So Broadcom played to Mr. Trump's soft spot — bringing companies back home. But the result may not be what Mr. Trump is envisioning — a Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm would most likely cost thousands of jobs, doing the very opposite of what the president said would happen.
Some of those workers who stood behind Mr. Trump in the Oval Office could very well end up on the chopping block.
If there is any question about Broadcom's job killing ambitions, look no further than its own news release, which said ""the combination of our two companies and associated synergies will be accretive to Broadcom's earnings.""
Notice the word ""synergies""? That word, a throwback to the 1990s merger days, has returned, but no one has forgotten what it is a euphemism for: cost-saving layoffs. Analysts have estimated that the savings from such synergy in Broadcom's case would most likely be about $1.5 billion.
Qualcomm has about 33,000 employees worldwide; about 10,000 of which are based in San Diego. Broadcom has nearly 16,000 employees worldwide, nearly half of them in the United States.
When Broadcom merged with in Avago in 2014, it said it expected $750 million in ""synergies."" At the time, Broadcom had 10,650 employees and Avago 8,200, for a total of 18,850 workers. Yet by 2016, after the two companies had integrated (and accounting for a divestiture that included 430 employees), the total head count was 15,700. In other words, 2,700 people lost their jobs.
By that math, considering Broadcom said it could achieve twice those savings in a deal with Qualcomm, some 5,400 people could lose their jobs — a good portion of the entire domestic head count at Broadcom.
Broadcom has made a business model of acquiring other companies, and their technology, and laying off employees. Some analysts describe the company as a ""roll-up"" — a company that keeps rolling-up more companies.
Qualcomm has been one of technology's great innovators, helping to establish many of the mobile telephone standards like LTE and the coming 5G. It has one of the largest research and development budgets in the world, spending $5 billion last year alone. Over the past decade, it has spent nearly $40 billion.
Mr. Tan of Broadcom has boasted that he plans to spend $3 billion ""in research and engineering."" Mr. Tan has been given high marks for managing the portfolio of Broadcom assets effectively, but he has never been known for industry-changing innovations.
And while the sound bite about Broadcom's bringing its $20 billion in revenues back to the United States sounds great, it isn't so clear it will happen immediately — or ever. About half of the company's revenues come from its Chinese partners. It is impossible to think the company won't have to continue to invest there given that's where much of the growth in the world is taking place.
So far, Qualcomm has rejected Broadcom's overtures, calling the bid an opportunistic effort to buy the company on the cheap. Qualcomm's stock has been under pressure because it has been engaged in a patent lawsuit with Apple, which has argued that Qualcomm is trying to gouge it for using its chips in its phones and has threatened to use Intel chips instead. Broadcom, in turn, has hinted that if it were to succeed in its bid for Qualcomm, it would reach a settlement with Apple.
The deal, which is already complicated, was made more so on Monday when Elliott Management, an activist hedge fund, argued that a planned deal by Qualcomm for NXP — which had been moving ahead despite the Broadcom bid — undervalues NXP, creating new questions about the fate of that transaction. If Qualcomm were to raise its offer for NXP, it could make itself less attractive for Broadcom.
Even if Broadcom doesn't end up merging with Qualcomm, it is unimaginable that it won't try to acquire other American companies, which may make its decision to redomicile ultimately make more sense.
If Broadcom was not intending to repatriate to the United States, you can only imagine the early morning tweetstorms we would have read from Mr. Trump denouncing the hostile bid.
But at least for now, he hasn't said a word.

 Qualcomm urges investors to resist Broadcom takeover   
 10:14  AM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  04:00 
 Qualcomm said Tuesday that it expects to earn much more money in the coming fiscal year than Wall Street has projected, and urged shareholders to resist the hostile takeover bid from rival Broadcom. 
 The chipmaker said it expects between $6.75 and $7.50 in earnings per share on revenue of $35 billion to $37 billion, substantially higher than the $3.79 per share Wall Street expects. 
The $103 billion hostile bid from Broadcom, then, ""dramatically undervalues"" the company, Qualcomm said in a letter to shareholders. 
 ""The math is clear – on a near-term value basis alone Broadcom's proposal dramatically undervalues Qualcomm, without even taking into account the substantial longer term upside from 5G,"" the company said. ""No matter how you look at it, Broadcom's proposal is not worthy of discussion from a value perspective.""
The company cited the near-term introduction of 5G, the likely positive impact of resolving a licensing dispute with Apple and the closure of an NXP Semiconductors acquisition as factors that would boost shareholder value. 
NXP shareholders Ramius Advisors and Elliott Management have said they will reject Qualcomm's offer.

 12:16  PM ET Thu,  1 Feb 2018 |  01:53 
 Broadcom is said to view Qualcomm's recent earnings report as concerning, though it is still expected to raise its bid for the chipmaker shortly, sources told CNBC.
 They may take into account diminished earnings near-term and their belief that Qualcomm won't be able to achieve the $7.50 earnings per share target it put out for fiscal year 2019 in its defense against Broadcom's unsolicited $103 billion bid, which it rejected last year.
But as expected, Broadcom is expected to raise its offer. It is considering a massive break-up fee, perhaps the biggest of all time, to soothe anti-trust concerns, the sources said. It could also include a material adverse effect clause.
 Qualcomm reported first quarter revenue and profit that beat expectations on Wednesday, but its operating profit fell 96 percent year over year to break even as Apple and its partners continued to withhold royalty payments. 
Of concern was the company's guidance for sales in the quarter ending in March, which were below analyst expectations.
Shares of Qualcomm are down 2.2 percent on Thursday.

 Kevin O'Leary is bullish on the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal   
 1:41  PM ET Mon,  5 Feb 2018 |  02:07 
 Broadcom increased its bid for rival chipmaker Qualcomm on Monday morning. If it succeeds, the deal is likely to generate some $3 billion in cost synergies, according to KeyBanc analysts.
That would likely mean cutting thousands of jobs, running counter to the pro-jobs agenda of the White House. That could strain the friendly relationship between Broadcom and the Trump administration. President Donald Trump in November publicly thanked Broadcom CEO Hock Tan for returning the company's headquarters to the United States and Tan in return praised the then-forthcoming tax overhaul.
 But billionaire investor Kevin O'Leary sees a bright side, he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Monday.
""People love this deal,"" he said. ""Many people that own Broadcom and Qualcomm, like me, want to see this."" 
The reasoning is pretty simple: $3 billion in ""synergies"" — a term often used to mean cost-saving layoffs — protects profits in the long run and, in this case, frees up engineers to fill the well-established tech talent shortage. 
""Those people will get hired immediately by other competitors,"" O'Leary said. ""These are very expensive engineers. Get the whacking stick out. I love that."" 
A combined Broadcom-Qualcomm could feed innovation in the rapidly growing semiconductor sector and eliminate some of the operational headaches. 
""[Broadcom CEO Hock Tan] already made that commitment to show that he'll bring jobs to America,"" O'Leary said. ""Now he's going to synergize America, which is even better — more productivity.""
Qualcomm consistently ranks at the top of its peers in innovation. Last year Strategy&, the global strategy consulting arm of PwC, listed the company 26th on its Global Innovation 1000 study of top R&D spenders, and CNBC named it to its own IQ 100 Index. 
But Qualcomm has been tied down for years in ongoing litigation with Apple over licensing agreements. 
""There are many shareholders, including me, who think Qualcomm is very poorly managed,"" O'Leary said. ""I would like adult supervision to come in from Broadcom, work it out with Apple and make it so that I can make more money with Apple as opposed to litigating until the cows come home.""

Paul Jacobs
 Qualcomm's board of directors unanimously rejected an acquisition proposal from competitor Broadcom, the company announced on Thursday.
 Broadcom had proposed acquiring all outstanding shares of Qualcomm for $82 per share, which breaks down to $60.00 in cash and $22 in Broadcom stock. Broadcom previously described the $121 billion as its ""best and final offer.""
In a letter from Qualcomm chairman Paul Jacobs to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, the board detailed their decision.
 ""The Board has unanimously determined that your amended offer materially undervalues Qualcomm and falls well short of the firm regulatory commitment the Board would demand given the significant downside risk of a failed transaction,"" Jacobs wrote in the letter.
Jacobs didn't completely strike out the prospect of a deal. He said the Qualcomm board would be open to meeting with Broadcom to explore ""all options for maximizing shareholder value,"" but reiterated the board's view that the proposal is ""inferior"" relative to Qualcomm's prospects as an independent company.
He also laid out questions for Broadcom should the two companies meet, including whether $82 per share really is Broadcom's highest offer, and just how far Broadcom was willing to go to close the deal. 
Qualcomm struck down a previous acquisition offer from Broadcom in November 2017, using a similar argument. Broadcom had offered to purchase Qualcomm stock at $70 per share.
In December, Qualcomm rejected director nominees picked by Broadcom and private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners, setting the stage for a proxy battle between the chipmakers.

 If you want to fight with Broadcom, you'd better be willing to put in some overtime. 
 At least that's what the chipmaker implied this week in an SEC filing addressed to Qualcomm —the latest document in an M&A struggle between the two rivals. In the filing, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan writes to Qualcomm executive chairman Paul Jacobs that he was ""astonished"" Qualcomm did not accept a weekend meeting to discuss a potential merger.
""Broadcom has long sought a meeting to discuss Broadcom's acquisition of Qualcomm. Following Qualcomm's announcement today that it is willing to meet with us, we offered to meet with Qualcomm on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. I was astonished to hear that Qualcomm is not willing to meet until Tuesday — only after Qualcomm's and Broadcom's respective meetings with Glass Lewis and ISS,"" Tan wrote in the official letter.
 Evan Vucci | AP
Broadcom CEO Hock Tan speaks as President Donald Trump listens during an event to announce the company is moving its global headquarters to the United States, in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington.
 Qualcomm's board said on Thursday — the date of Tan's letter — that it had rejected a revised takeover bid from Broadcom.  Broadcom had offered $121 billion, its ""best and final offer,"" although Qualcomm felt it was ""inferior"" to its prospects as an independent company.
But Broadcom contends the mega-merger — which would eclipse its $37 billion blockbuster merger with Avago as the biggest chip deal — would consolidate power in the chip business, giving the combined company leverage to negotiate with big tech companies over everything from servers to self-driving cars. 
Of course, all this depends on whether the two companies can actually pencil each other in for a meeting.  
""We urge you to meet with us without further delay, and stand ready to meet this Saturday or Sunday in New York or another mutually convenient location,"" Tan wrote, hammering the point home with the closing: ""We look forward to meeting with you promptly.""
