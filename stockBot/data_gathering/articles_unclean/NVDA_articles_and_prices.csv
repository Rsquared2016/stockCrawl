Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp.
 Wall Street is increasingly worried over the future growth opportunities for the two best-performing stocks in the market during the past year.Chipmakers Nvidia and AMD shares are both down significantly in recent days. Nvidia declined more than 5 percent over the past week through midday Thursday, while AMD fell 12 percent in that time period.The Nvidia decline was in part sparked by a negative Citron Research report on Nvidia Friday.""Take your profits and move on to Google (Alphabet). Exposure to the identical array of 'sexy businesses' with less risk on the downside,"" Citron Research's Andrew Left wrote in a post entitled ""NVIDIA: The Moment that Separates the Gamblers from the Investors. NVDA to Trade back to $130."" Left cited competition coming from Intel, Google and Xilinx in the data center markets and the likelihood of slowing growth in its gaming graphics card business as reasons for his skeptical view on Nvidia's market value.Wells Fargo is also concerned over rising competition in Nvidia's data center business. The firm reiterated its underperform rating on the company Wednesday.""We think that Nvidia has done very well in establishing itself as the dominant provider of standalone accelerator solutions for data center, but believe that this is already reflected in Nvidia's stock value,"" Wells Fargo analyst David Wong wrote in a note to clients. ""Over time we think additional providers of standalone accelerators might emerge, helping to drive growth in the standalone processor market but reducing Nvidia's market share in this market.""Even with the move lower, Nvidia shares have rallied 218 percent through midday Thursday in the previous 12 months compared with the market's 17 percent return. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet. AMD is right behind at No. 2 with a 156 percent return in the same time period.
 In similar fashion to the negative Nvidia notes, Goldman Sachs told investors to sell AMD shares Monday, questioning whether the recent cryptocurrency-driven demand for the company's graphics cards will last. ""According to our checks, the RX 570 and RX 580 graphics cards are sold out at numerous retail websites including NewEgg and Microcenter. While this dynamic may provide near-term upside to fundamentals, we believe [cryptocurrency mining] is unlikely to become a sustainable driver of EPS,"" Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in the note to clients.Nvidia declined to comment on the Citron and Wells Fargo reports. An AMD spokesperson responded to the Goldman report by email:
 ""When we outlined our growth strategy at our financial analyst day earlier this quarter we didn't highlight cryptocurrency market as one of the drivers of growth for the business.""

 Investors are going wild for Nvidia   
 9:40  AM ET Tue, 20 June 2017 |  03:21 
 Interest in chipmaker Nvidia has exploded.
 From the stock's average daily volume (more than 10 times that of some similarly sized and priced companies) to the total options open interest (more than six times that of similarly sized and priced companies), investors are appearing to pile into a semiconductor stock that's tripled over the last year.
For example, about 750,000 options contracts on Nvidia are outstanding, while similarly sized Celgene, Qualcomm and United Technologies have about 260,000, 580,000 and 100,000, respectively. An average of 30.3 million Nvidia shares have traded daily this year, far above the aforementioned companies' average daily volumes of 3 million, 5.9 million and 2.2 million, respectively.
 ""It's a trader's favorite and it should be a long-term investor's favorite, too. Nvidia scores very high in our momentum rankings,"" Oppenheimer technical analyst Ari Wald said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation,"" adding that he ranks it a momentum stock.
As far as near-term key levels to watch for the $157 stock, Wald highlighted $168 to the upside — its peak earlier this month — and to the downside $142, which is this month's low. Though the stock could see consolidation below $168, should the shares break above that, it would indicate ""that the longer-term uptrend is resuming.""
As long as Nvidia shares trade above the support level of $142, as well as their 20-day moving average, Wald said, ""you can consider the near-term trading action is higher — and the trend is higher.""
 Pacific Crest on Tuesday upgraded its rating on Nvidia, citing rising demand in the cryptocurrency space for its graphic computing units even though ""sustainability is in question."" The firm just two months ago downgraded the stock.
Peering into the options market activity on the semiconductor name, Harvest Volatility Management portfolio manager Dennis Davitt calls Nvidia ""a stock that is made for options.""
""Options allow you to get yourself exposure with limited risk and in a stock that moves around as much as this stock is — that's always a good thing to have. The real interesting thing we are seeing in Nvidia is a real demand for upside calls,"" Davitt said Monday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""
The stock has vacillated between about $95 and $168 per share this year.
""As a matter of fact, the demand for upside for people trying to get participation in this stock — without risking too much money by buying those calls — has kind of disjointed the market,"" he added, pointing out that the call options are now becoming more valuable than comparable puts.
The strong interest in the call options actually creates an opportunity for those who own the stock, Davitt said.
Investors who own shares of Nvidia can sell a call with a striking price $30 above where the stock is currently trading and simultaneously buy a put with a striking price $20 below where the stock is for roughly no money.
""So you get paid, in essence, to insure your position,"" Davitt said. ""And that's just because there are so many people playing options in Nvidia right now and it's on a daily basis one of the highest options contracts out there.""

 9:40  AM ET Tue, 20 June 2017 |  03:21 
 Wall Street doesn't like to admit to its mistakes, but Pacific Crest was forced to capitulate on its poorly timed downgrade of Nvidia after just over two months. The firm raised its rating for the semiconductor company to sector weight from underweight due to rising cryptocurrency mining demand for its graphics cards. ""Meetings with desktop graphics card manufacturers indicated a sharp reversal in sales trends expected for the seasonally weaker 2Q, with surging demand from cryptocurrency miners in China and Eastern Europe,"" analyst Michael McConnell wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""The sharp increase in demand from cryptocurrency miners has rapidly depleted excess channel inventory carried into the quarter."" McConnell retracted his previous $99 price target for Nvidia. The stock is up about 45 percent through Monday since the analyst's downgrade in early April. 
 AMD told CNBC in early June the ""newly resurgent cryptocurrency mining markets"" were driving demand for its graphics cards. 
Ethereum cryptocurrency is up over 4,500 percent year to date through Monday, while bitcoin is up about 170 percent this year, according to data from industry website CoinDesk.  Cryptocurrency miners use graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia to ""mine"" new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation.  ""In terms of demand sustainability from the cryptocurrency market, desktop graphics card manufacturers are skeptical, referring to the one-quarter demand surge in 2013, which was followed by an inventory correction,"" McConnell wrote. ""Most desktop graphics card manufacturers surveyed expect strong demand to last until late-July or August, but visibility is extremely low given the volatility in cryptocurrency prices."" 
 Nvidia shares rallied 231 percent through Monday in the previous 12 months compared with the market's 18 percent return in that period. That performance ranks number one in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.

4,2017-06-21,"Intel faces stiffer competition from 'resurgent' Nvidia, AMD, BofA says  ","CNBC | Getty Images
Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel.
 Intel's ability to easily raise chip prices may be ending, as the company faces tougher competition from AMD and Nvidia, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch research analyst said.The bank lowered its rating on Intel to neutral from buy, predicting the company will lose market share to AMD's latest server chips and Nvidia's artificial intelligence processors.
Analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients Wednesday that AMD has introduced a set of data center server products with attractive pricing and several large customers, including Microsoft, HP, Lenovo and Baidu. His note was entitled ""Resurgent AMD, NVDA could limit INTC's price advantage.""
 Competition from AMD and Nvidia could curb Intel's ability to expand its average selling price, something that has been a key source of growth, Arya said.  ""It's early days and AMD's historical execution has been weak, but we believe increased AMD competition in servers, and share gains by NVDA in AI/accelerators, could limit INTC's expansion of its avg. selling prices (ASP)."" The analyst reduced his Intel price target to $38 from $42. The lower target would be a 9 percent gain from Tuesday's close. Intel was able to increase its data center sales by an annualized 11 percent in the past five years. However 3 to 4 percentage points of those gains per year came from price increases, he said.
In PCs, Intel's sales growth has been flat over five years as rising average sales prices offset declines in unit sales. ""Both these trends are at risk if large PC, cloud and enterprise customers now have AMD as an option,"" Arya wrote. ""Meanwhile NVDA continues to put pressure by shifting more workloads on to its graphics accelerators, and away from INTC's processors.""
Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story.

 Cramer's Mad Dash: Cryptocurrency play   
 9:50  AM ET Fri, 23 June 2017 |  01:41 
 There are many reasons for investors to buy chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, but the recent rush for an indirect way to play skyrocketing cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ethereum should not be one of them, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday. ""One of the reasons why AMD and Nvidia have been going up is their chips are used for mining, for cryptocurrency mining,"" Cramer told ""Squawk on the Street."" But he warned, ""Do not play it for this is what I'm saying. But it is being played for that."" Bitcoin and ethereum miners use powerful graphics processing units — or the computer chips on graphics cards — to generate new cryptocurrency units, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation. Cramer cited a recent note from RBC Capital Markets, which said the growing cryptocurrency mining market has contributed $100 million worth of GPU sales for Nvidia in the past 11 days alone. ""AMD chips are the best ones for the ethereum platform,"" he added. ""Of course there are so many other uses for their chips, but a lot of retail people love bitcoin and are looking for a way to play it,"" Cramer said.
 In the past 12 months, bitcoin has soared about 325 percent to around $2,703 per unit as of midmorning trading on Friday. Ethereum, the smaller bitcoin rival, has skyrocketed about 2,240 percent to around $328.
In the past month, as the cryptocurrency surges have been more widely reported, AMD shares have soared 33 percent and Nvidia stock has gained about 15 percent.
 ""You play Nvidia for artificial intelligence, for GPUs, for autonomous cars, and for gaming,"" he said. ""You play AMD for gaming and they have a faster chip than Intel."" Buying the stocks for those reasons, not because of cryptocurrency mining, makes sense, Cramer concluded.

 Nvidia, AMD and ASUS have not officially announced the digital currency mining cards, according to their website press pages. It is not certain when the cards will be available for sale.The dramatic jump in digital currency prices this year is driving demand for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards. Cryptocurrency miners use graphics cards from both companies to ""mine"" new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation.
Nvidia is likely making the cards designed for this use so that the surging digital currency demand doesn't affect its ability to serve the lucrative PC gaming market. The ethereum cryptocurrency is up more than 2,700 percent year to date through midday Tuesday, while bitcoin is up more than 140 percent this year, according to data from industry website CoinDesk.

 2:00  PM ET Tue, 27 June 2017 |  00:45 
 Nvidia, the market's best-performing stock in the past year, received a big price forecast increase from Mizuho Securities Tuesday.
 Analyst Vijay Rakesh told investors to buy the semiconductor company's shares, citing the strong business opportunities in the digital currency mining markets this year. ""We believe near-term strength in cryptocurrency mining with the run-up in Bitcoin is creating some GPU [graphics processing unit] shortages ahead of new title launches such as Destiny2, Call of DutyWW2 and Battlefront2,"" Rakesh wrote in the note to clients. ""We believe while 1H17 gaming has been soft, conservative gaming estimates for 2H17 could see upside as near term cryptocurrency and mining trends are driving GPU"" demand. Nvidia will release graphic cards specifically designed for cryptocurrency mining through its partners, according to a CNBC report Tuesday.  The company's shares rallied 219 percent through Tuesday in the previous 12 months compared with the market's 19 percent return in that period. That performance ranks number one in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet. The shares are up 37 percent this year versus the market's 8 percent performance.
This rally has coincided with a surge in digital currencies. For example, ethereum is up more than 3,500 percent in 2017. The analyst reaffirmed his buy rating and raised his price target for Nvidia to $170 from $145, representing 16 percent upside from Tuesday's close. Rakesh noted how pricing for Nvidia's gaming graphics cards are rising in recent weeks on retailer websites, which is a positive sign for demand. In addition, he cited the strong sales of the Nintendo Switch gaming console, which includes a Nvidia chip. ""While NVDA's valuations are steep, we believe current street estimates are conservative ... so that improving PCs, gaming trends, VR, and datacenter position for upside to estimates,"" he wrote. ""NVDA is also well positioned for the up and coming machine learning, deep learning, and AI markets."" Multiple Wall Street firms have raised their forecasts for Nvidia shares this month including Citi Research and UBS.

 Trader: Buy the pullback in Nvidia   
 3:42  PM ET Thu,  6 July 2017 |  03:56 
 One of hottest stocks over the past year has come off of all-time highs, but Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com says the charts make a compelling case for buying on the pullback.
 As of Thursday, Nvidia was down 15 percent from the intraday all-time high that it hit on June 9. But the stock has still tripled over the past year, making it the best performer in the S&P 500. And according to Gordon, a look at the charts shows that the chipmaker's almost 3 percent gain this week could suggest that history is about to repeat itself and that Nvidia is about to head higher.
Gordon specifically points to what he's calling a ""three-wave pullback,"" in reference to the three previous times when Nvidia has fallen, only to then surge to new highs. Based on the length of the past pullbacks, the recent drop in Nvidia looks to be complete, according to Gordon, meaning that the stock will mirror past moves and rally.
 ""We are right on top of the equality point, so basically this distance is equal to the prior correction,"" he said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""You see this kind of symmetry in the markets all the time. If you just know how to look for it, you can pick up some pretty good turning points.""
 Since Nvidia looks to be at the tail end of its pullback, Gordon believes that the support level for the stock is between $135 and $140, which the shares have bounced up from in the past week. And since implied volatility, which measures the relative price of options, is so high, he wants to make a bullish bet on Nvidia by selling options rather than buying them..
 As a result, Gordon is selling the July 21 140-strike puts and buying the July 21 135-strike puts for $2.04 total, or $204 credit per options spread.
Should Nvidia close above $140 on July 21 expiration, Gordon would get to keep that amount, for his maximum profit of $204. The trade breaks even at $137.96, and if Nvidia closes below $135 on July 21, Gordon would suffer the maximum loss of $296.
However, should the stock fall to $135 before expiration, Gordon would advocate exiting the trade, which would likely mean taking a smaller loss.
To be sure, the options are expensive for a reason. Nvidia shares traded in a nearly 4 percent range on Thursday alone. The stock's volatile nature means that both bullish and bearish bets have a better chance of paying off than would options on most other stocks.

Brian Krzanich, Intel CEO, speaks during the Intel press conference at CES in Las Vegas, January 4, 2017.
 Jefferies downgraded Intel from hold to underperform on Monday, saying the chipmaker has the ""most to lose"" in the ""4th tectonic shift in computing.""
 Jefferies said it is downgrading Intel because ""its Xeon/Xeon PHI platform is disadvantaged vs NVidia in emerging parallel workloads like deep neural networking.""
Jefferies calls out several areas of concern for Intel, including Microsoft's Windows new support for ARM processors and the rapid 200 percent growth of Nvdia's data-center business year over year.
 Nvidia has been one of the market's hottest stocks recently; SoftBank Group bought a $4 billion stake in Nvidia in May. Shares of Nvidia are up 28 percent this year.
In a separate note on the semiconductor sector, Jefferies says it sees a major ""tectonic shift"" in the industry that will favor parallel computing platforms already used by AMD, Nvidia, Cavium and Xilinx.
Earlier tectonic shifts noted by Jefferies included the mainframe era in the 1950s; the minicomputer era in the 1970s; the personal computer era in the 1980s and 1990s; the cellphone/server era in the 2000s and the parallel processing IoT era we're just now entering.
""NVDA was the first to recognize and successfully invest in a HW/SW platform (GPU/CUDA) targeted specifically at parallel processing applications, and our field checks suggest it is years ahead of its competition,"" Jefferies said, referring to Nvidia's strategy to take advantage of computing power from graphics processing units versus standard processors.
Jefferies reset its 2018 price target for Intel to $29 from $38. Shares of Intel were at $33.30 in Monday's premarket, down 1.7 percent.

 Shares of Nvidia jumped 4 percent to a record close on an upgrade from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
 Here's the thing: SunTrust is playing catch-up with the rest of Wall Street, who have already upgraded Nvidia.
Nvidia's shares have more than tripled in the last 12 months, beating out the returns of any other company in the S&P 500. Early last month, Citi set a 12-month price target of $180 on Nvidia. That's a tad more bullish than SunTrust.
 The stock posted a record close of $159.94 in early June before pulling back. Nvidia closed today up $6.63 to $162.51. The shares are still a few dollars short of their all-time intraday high of $168.50 touched last month.
SunTrust's William Stein admits he is a bit late to the call. ""We've under-forecasted the growth potential in these markets,"" Stein said, referring to Nvidia's growth in datacenter, gaming and automotive.
Stein said SunTrust is modeling 82 percent annual datacenter growth through 2018 versus Street estimates of 61 percent. His firm matches Wall Street's estimates of 11 percent year-over-year growth through 2018 in gaming.
Stein said that datacenter growth can be ""lumpy"" and calls it out as one potential risk.
""A temporary slowdown in growth would not only hurt revenue & EPS but would likely damage the P/E multiple as well,"" Stein said. ""A slow down in the PC gaming growth or increased competition in this market could also damage revenue, EPS, and the P/E multiple.""
SunTrust previously had a hold on Nvidia at $124. With its move to a buy rating, SunTrust set a $177 price target.

 Josh: Albemarle is breaking out   
 7:37  PM ET Mon,  7 Aug 2017 |  01:39 
 Shares of Albemarle and Nvidia hit new all-time highs on Monday, and Josh Brown of CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" said he thinks their run is far from over.
 Each company is a leader in its field, which Brown says will drive these stocks higher.
ALBEMARLE:
 Brown owns Albemarle as way to play the electric vehicle space without having to own auto stocks directly. The Charlotte, N.C.-based company makes lithium, which is used in electric vehicles, a growing part of the auto market as companies like Elon Musk's Tesla, Mercedez-Benz and Volvo expand in the business.
""If you want to be bullish on electric vehicles but you don't trust what Musk is doing financially at Tesla, the play is lithium,"" Brown said on the ""Halftime Report.""
Automakers need lithium to manufacture electric vehicles, which means demand will remain high for Albemarle's products. Brown also points out that there are very few companies that manufacture lithium, meaning Albemarle is in a strong position as demand for electric vehicles rises.
The shares are up 43 percent year-to-date.
""This thing is breaking out...trend looks phenomenal,"" he said.

 NVIDIA
Like Albemarle, Brown owns Nvidia because the Santa Clara, Calif., company is a leader in chips for gaming and artificial intelligence.
He argues that ""there's nobody at the same level in the game or even close"" to Nvidia since the company manufactures the two fastest chips for AI applications.
Nvidia has risen 60 percent this year, and the stock trades at 55X forward earnings.

 Barclays is saying the cryptocurrency mining-driven demand for AMD's graphics cards will not last and is telling investors to avoid the chipmaker's shares.
 The bank's semiconductor analyst, Blayne Curtis, reiterated his underweight rating and his $9 price target for AMD, representing 33 percent downside from Monday's close. ""We are revisiting AMD's last earnings release with an analysis of the [Ethereum] tailwind, which now appears to be the source of the better revenue in June/Sept [guidance], and why investors should place very little value on this earnings stream,"" Curtis wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We believe estimates could be too high next year should this [Ethereum] tailwind dry up.""Cryptocurrency miners use graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia to ""mine"" new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation. AMD traditionally has a better reputation for mining cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, according to Wall Street. Ethereum cryptocurrency is up more than 3,300 percent year to date through Tuesday, according to data from industry website CoinDesk. The analyst said that outside the cryptocurrency mining market demand, AMD has lost market share to Nvidia in the gaming market, according to data from Steam, a digital PC game store. In addition, he estimates due to high graphics card prices in the secondary market it is now not profitable to mine Ethereum.
""We still believe AMD is seeing little traction with its server chip (Epyc) and this likely crypto headwind only bolsters our underweight thesis,"" Curtis wrote.  The company's shares are one of the market's best-performing equities in the past year with the stock up nearly 100 percent in the past 12 months through midday Tuesday compared with the S&P 500's 14 percent return. That performance ranks No. 3 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
 The chipmaker reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and guidance last month.AMD sent the following statement in response to this story:
 ""While our GPUs have obvious applications in cryptocurrency, our main corporate focus remains on PCs, Gaming, and the Datacenter. We realize the uncertainty of the cryptocurrency market and are not looking at it as a long-term growth driver, but we'll certainly continue to monitor the developments around blockchain technologies as they go forward.""

 Nvidia beats on top and bottom line   
 6:58  PM ET Thu, 10 Aug 2017 |  01:04 
 Graphics chipmaker Nvidia saw its stock fall more than 7 percent on Thursday after it reported stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of its 2018 fiscal year, which ended on July 31.
 EPS: Excluding certain items, $1.01 in earnings per share vs. $0.70 in earnings per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $2.23 billion vs. $1.96 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. 
In terms of guidance, the company said it expects to generate $2.35 billion in revenue, plus or minus 2 percent, in the third quarter of its 2018 fiscal year. Analysts were expecting guidance of $2.13 billion for the upcoming quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.
 Strong reactions to earnings results are not unusual for Nvidia, which is popular with investors these days as the company has emphasized the importance of its graphics processing units for artificial intelligence. In May Nvidia stock rose more than 13 percent after the company released its earnings results for the previous quarter, beating estimates on both EPS and revenue. Ahead of earnings on Thursday Nvidia stock closed down more than 4 percent.
Revenue was up 56 percent year over year, with the company's Datacenter revenue -- including sales of GPUs to public cloud providers like Amazon Web Services -- leading the way at 175 percent revenue growth, even though it was up just 2 percent sequentially. That -- and selling on the news -- could explain the stock drop despite the earnings beat, Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy told CNBC. Indeed, sales in the Datacenter segment ended up below the FactSet analyst estimate, according to StreetAccount.
Nvidia's gaming revenue -- the biggest contributor to the company's top line -- was up 52 percent year over year, and it beat analysts' estimates, according to StreetAccount.
Sentiment around Nvidia has continued to be generally positive since then. Last month Canaccord Genuity raised its estimates for Nvidia ""yet again"" as it sees continuing strength in the gaming and automotive markets.
The opportunity around cryptocurrency has caused some analysts to become more optimistic about Nvidia. Two months after Pacific Crest downgraded Nvidia stock, the company made a U-turn and raised the stock's rating. 
""Our strategy is to stay alert to this fast-changing market, knowing that GPUs are highly efficient at running the algorithms used to mine cryptocurrencies,"" Nvidia executive vice president and chief financial officer Colette Kress told financial analysts on the company's quarterly earnings call.
Nvidia's next quarter could see gains as the company increases the sales of its Volta Tesla V100 GPUs, which will also be listed under the company's Datacenter business -- shipments of GPUs based on the Volta architecture have indeed begun, Nvidia said. The quarter was a transition in the move from Pascal architecture to Volta,  Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said on the conference call.
Volta is especially designed to accommodate AI workloads, not unlike Alphabet's second-generation tensor processing unit (TPU), which will become available for anyone to use exclusively on Google's public cloud. Meanwhile Intel has been cooking up chips that are more geared toward AI, and Microsoft said it's working on an AI coprocessor for its HoloLens mixed reality headset.
""Nvidia GPU is basically a TPU that does a lot more,"" Huang said.
In the quarter Nvidia did not receive revenue as a result of its patent license agreement with Intel. That deal wrapped up in the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, when revenue came out to $43 million, Nvidia said.
In May Softbank disclosed that it had taken a stake in Nvidia through its Vision Fund, sending Nvidia stock up 1.8 percent. 
Nvidia stock -- the best performing stock of the year, as CNBC's Tae Kim noted on Wednesday -- is up 55 percent since the beginning of the year, according to FactSet.

Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang attends an event during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan May 30, 2017.
 Nvidia is telling its investors that cryptocurrencies are no longer just a niche business.
 In the company's earnings call on Thursday, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said that demand for cryptocurrencies like ethereum helped Nvidia beat its own guidance for the most recent quarter. 
Crypto is ""a very important market that will likely continue to grow over time,"" Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said on the call. 
 Nvidia offers a type of graphics processing unit that's optimized for virtual coin mining, Huang said. CNBC reported in June that an Nvidia-based mining GPU had been listed on Asus's website, but Nvidia had not previously announced the card.
""In June we began enabling our AICs to produce a mining-only card using our P106-100 GPU,"" an Nvidia spokesman told CNBC in an email. ""This GPU is configured for crypto mining and cannot be used for gaming. We provided it to several board partners including ASUS, EVGA, Colorful, Galaxy, Gigabyte, Palit, PCP and MSI."" Nvidia itself is not offering GPUs for mining, the spokesman wrote.
Fellow GPU maker AMD has also seenincreased demand for digital currency mining.
""It is very clear that new currencies will come to market, and it's very clear that the GPU is just fantastic at cryptography,"" Huang said. ""The only thing we can probably expect is there will be more currencies to come. It will come in a whole lot of different nations, it will emerge from time to time, and the GPU is really quite great for it.""
Despite the surging interest in cryptocurrencies in 2017 and the rally in prices of ethereum and bitcoin, Nvidia representatives had not discussed the topic on an earning call in at least the past year. Artificial intelligence and automotive applications have been more popular areas of focus.
Even with rising demand for GPUs, Nvidia shares fell as much as 8 percent following Thursday's report, as data center revenue trailed analysts' estimates.

 Market's hottest stock Nvidia plunges after traders didn't get perfect earnings report they expected   
 11:31  AM ET Fri, 11 Aug 2017 |  00:53 
 When a company is by far the best performing stock in the entire market, it needs to report perfect results to drive its shares higher.Nvidia did not do that Thursday, when it posted lackluster sales in a key growth market, a unit that serves artificial intelligence applications. The chipmaker reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and guidance, but its data center segment sales, where its cards are used for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, came in at $416 million versus the $423 million Wall Street consensus FactSet estimate.
 Its shares opened down 5 percent on Friday, after falling as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading following the report.
""Our sense is that investors are disappointed in the datacenter quarter-over-quarter deceleration and view crypto upside as low quality,"" Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""What we believe is not well understood is that in contrast to new gaming GPUs, which users buy and use instantaneously, new datacenter GPUs need to be tested and qualified before being scaled into datacenter-applications.""Lipacis reiterated his buy rating and his $180 price target for Nvidia shares, representing 9 percent upside to Thursday's close.The data center market was a big focus on the Wall Street earnings call with Nvidia management Thursday. An analyst started the question and answer session by asking why the data center sales growth slowed to 2 percent quarter over quarter from the 38 percent rate in the fiscal first quarter. ""We have seen several quarters where your data center business grew very strongly on a sequential basis. This time the growth was somewhat more modest,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya said on the call.
 CEO Jensen Huang said new products were a factor in the data center's slower growth.
""Q2 was a transition quarter for our data center. I thought we did great,"" Huang said, according to a FactSet transcript. ""And so Volta was such a giant leap when we announced it ... right at the beginning of the quarter. I thought the team did fantastically transitioning the customer base to Volta, and now Volta is in high-volume production.""
Nvidia launched new data center graphics cards named Volta in May. Wall Street is not giving up on Nvidia. ""While the bears are likely to point to the deceleration in datacenter in FY2Q … we remain bullish on NVDA's medium- to long-term opportunity in the business as the company's GPU franchise continues to benefit from the proliferation of artificial intelligence/machine learning,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari wrote Friday. Hari reiterated his buy rating and $193 price target for Nvidia shares. ""Overall, we think expectations were simply too high into the print and the secular story remains unchanged,"" RBC Capital Markets' Mitch Steves wrote Thursday. The analyst reaffirmed his outperform rating and $175 price target for the chip company.Nvidia's stock is up 176 percent in the past 12 months through Thursday compared with the S&P 500's 11.6 percent return. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500 way ahead of Micron's second-place return of 90.5 percent, according to FactSet.The company declined to comment on Friday's Wall Street analyst research. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.

Nvidia Founder, President and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang.
 Nvidia shares surged 6 percent midday Monday, making up Friday's giant drop — and then some — after Canaccord Genuity told its clients to buy the ""pullback."" 
The firm reiterated its buy rating on the chipmaker's shares, predicting Nvidia's data center sales will improve the next quarter.  
 The company's shares fell 5.3 percent on Friday, a day after it reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and guidance Thursday after the close. Some investors were disappointed over its data center segment sales, which came in at $416 million versus the $423 million Wall Street consensus FactSet estimate for the quarter. ""We believe Friday's pullback will prove the entry point many investors have been looking for,"" analyst Matthew Ramsay wrote in a note to clients Sunday. ""Nvidia is continuing to execute strongly into several secular growth markets … we believe new trends including deep learning, virtual/augmented reality, and autonomous driving will catalyze new market growth longer term."" The analyst raised his price target for Nvidia to $190 from $180, representing 22 percent upside from Friday's close.
Data center segment growth is ""poised to rebound,"" he wrote. ""We believe several large datacenter customers likely delayed purchases while waiting for Volta-based platforms to fully ramp late in the quarter … [We] anticipate a strong sales ramp for Volta based datacenter cards.""
Nvidia  launched new data center graphics cards named Volta in May.  As a result, the analyst raised his Nvidia fiscal 2018 earnings per share estimate to $4.09 from $3.61. Nvidia's stock is up more than 160 percent in the past 12 months through midday Monday compared with the S&P 500's 13 percent return. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.

Reed Hastings, chief executive officer of Netflix, speaks during a news conference in Tokyo on Monday, June 27, 2016.
 Goldman Sachs is encouraging clients to invest in high-growth stocks, predicting that higher interest rates in 2018 will cause earnings expansion to slow, therefore placing a premium value on fast-growing companies.
 ""The majority of the recent market rally has been driven by higher earnings rather than valuation expansion,"" wrote Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin. ""Going forward, we expect growth to continue to drive S&P 500 stock returns. We expect that the prospect of 4 Fed rate hikes in 2018 will result in a forward P/E contraction.""
Kostin isolated firms allocating 90 percent of cash flow from operations to fund growth initiatives during the past three years into a ""High Growth Investment"" basket, including Netflix and chipmaker Nvidia.
 To insulate the effects of reductions in earnings multiples, Kostin recommended these high growth stocks to investors.
 Fifty-five percent of S&P 500 companies have beaten earnings expectations in the second quarter, the highest share of companies since 2010. Kostin reiterated that Goldman expects the S&P 500 will end 2017 at 2,400, slightly below its current level.
While information technology and health care have led the charge, investors have been slow to reward companies beating expectations with 2018 revisions, hinting at the market's belief in future pressure on multiples in the market.

 7:23  PM ET Tue, 15 Aug 2017 |  00:59 
 The semiconductor stocks have been trading wildly of late, getting hit in July 2017 and again during last week's sell-off before bouncing back on Monday.
 These dramatic moves made Jim Cramer wonder which move was really telling the truth about where the group is headed: down with the pullback or up with the rally?
That's why the ""Mad Money"" host teamed up with technician Carolyn Boroden, the brain behind FibonacciQueen.com and one of his colleagues at RealMoney.com, to go off the charts of three key chipmakers' stocks: Nvidia, Micron and Applied Materials.
 Cramer started with Nvidia's daily chart. One of the top stocks in the S&P 500 Index for the second year in a row, his dog's namesake gave buyers a momentary chance to get into the stock last week before running back up to $166 and change as of Tuesday.
 While investors who don't already own shares of Nvidia might be late to the party, Boroden believes the stock still deserves their attention.
""The stock occasionally gives you a pullback like last week ... and when that happens, it tends to really roll over as weak-handed bulls, who owned it only because it was going higher, decide to abandon ship,"" Cramer said.
Boroden noted that Nvidia's decline last week was similar to its past declines over the course of its rally. She also found two strong floors of support, from $151 to $152 and from $144 to $148.
After Nvidia grazed the first floor of support last week, dipping below $153, the stock bounced back hard, and Boroden believes it can continue to do the same going forward.
""Given that August and September are brutal months where we often get short, sharp pullbacks ... you'll want to watch this $152 level in case Nvidia gives you another buying opportunity,"" Cramer suggested.
Based on Nvidia's stock pattern to date, Boroden thinks the next pullback could come in mid-September. That said, she still gives the stock three upside targets: from $176 to $180, then from $187 to $188, and if the stock pushes past both, then she expects it to hit a ceiling at $209.
""So, if you already own it, like my charitable trust does, Boroden thinks you could have smooth sailing until next month, and if you don't own it, then maybe think about waiting for that next sell-off in September, if it holds these levels, to pull the trigger,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Micron's stock is more boom-and-bust than Nvidia's. Shares of the commodity chipmaker peaked in June and have drifted lower since before bouncing back on Monday.
With the stock up over $29 as of Tuesday's closing bell, Boroden wouldn't be shocked to see it climb to $34 or even $36. But if Micron breaks below its $25 floor of support, Boroden said that would start the ""bust"" part of its cycle.
""Once Micron and its competitors start really boosting their production, pricing will eventually fall apart. The earnings estimates will get slashed,"" Cramer said. ""Of course, that's been hanging over Micron's head for ages. [It] hasn't stopped the stock from rallying hard over the past 18 months, but it has most recently. Just remember that the run in Micron has a limited shelf-life.""
Applied Materials' situation is similar, Boroden said: If the stock can hold above its floor of support in the low $40s, it could rally to the high $40s or even the low $50s.
But just like the others, if Applied Materials dips below $41 or its second floor of support just above $40, then Boroden suggests investors ditch the semiconductor equipment stock.
""The charts ... show you how to approach the likes of Nvidia, Micron and Applied Materials when they get hit,"" Cramer said. ""And given that we're in a historically rough time of year, I bet they'll get hit again in the not-too-distant future. When that happens, I'm very on board with Nvidia. I like Applied Materials. Micron? At this point, it is too boom and bust for me, and I do believe the easy money has been made and then some.""

 Nike, Nvidia and other failing stocks could be signaling market shift everyone trying to forecast   
 1:37  PM ET Fri, 18 Aug 2017 |  00:42 
 Stocks have been surprisingly resilient in the face of bigger-picture risks around the world, though some would argue that it isn't all that surprising.
 There hasn't been a significant pullback in the U.S. markets since the end of 2015 into early 2016, when the S&P 500 fell by around 14 percent between early November and mid-February. Since then, traders and investors have been rewarded for buying stocks on any kind of a retreat, but could it finally be time for that larger pullback that so many have been trying to forecast?
While there aren't any real ways to reliably predict the future, some traders are looking for signs of changing market sentiment in some of the stocks that have been success stories as of late. One way to try and identify stocks that could act as ""tells"" on the broader market is to screen for them using certain parameters.
 In order to illustrate this point, we ran a simple screen to look for stocks that have been relative winners in recent trading, but have been showing some signs of weakness. The parameters are as follows:
 S&P 500 members. Recent highs hit in August month to date. Greater than 5 percent pullback from those highs. 
 The search found 109 stocks in the S&P 500 that have hit 52-week highs this month. Of those, 23 stocks have pulled back by at least 5 percent from those recent highs.
Some notable stocks passed those screening parameters, including athletic apparel giant Nike, farm equipment maker Deere, semiconductor maker Nvidia and online travel site Priceline Group.
And some continue their fall. Nike was down 4.7 percent on Friday morning and Deere was down 8.4 percent. 
Some of these stocks have been much more of a momentum play than others. For example, Nvidia shares have already gained 51 percent in 2017, and 164 percent over the last 12 months. They are nearly 8 percent below recent highs. Meanwhile, Prudential Financial hit a high on Aug. 2, and has fallen 11 percent since then, resulting in a 2 percent drop on a year-to-date basis.
Screens like this are one of the many ways that some traders are identifying shifting momentum. This is by no means a perfect way to measure a turn in the market, but some of these screening methods could help in identifying emerging trends.

22,2017-08-31,Samsung gets approval from California to test self-driving cars  ,"Chesnot | Getty Images 
Visitors play a game with the virtual reality head-mounted Samsung Gear VR powered by Oculus at Le Grand Palais on December 15, 2016 in Paris, France.
 Electronics giant Samsung is the latest company to get the go-ahead to test self-driving cars on California's public roads.
That's according to the list of companies who've agreed to the terms of the Autonomous Vehicle Tester Program from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, which was updated Wednesday. Samsung joins companies such as  Apple, Bosch, Delphi, NVIDIA and Waymo, as well as automakers like BMW, General Motors, and Volkswagen.
In May,  Samsung received approval to test cars in its home country of South Korea, using software adapted to Hyundai vehicles. That sounds odd because Samsung owns nearly 20 percent of Renault Samsung Motors, which is part of the Renault-Nissan alliance that's the world's fourth-largest auto producer. Nissan also has approval to test self-driving cars in California.
 But in 2015, Samsung announced a new division that would focus on self-driving vehicle software, rather than the creation of the entire vehicle.
Samsung could be trying to keep up with its tech rivals in the automotive space, especially as Apple has  shifted its focus from autonomous cars to autonomous systems. With the okay to test in California, where it maintains a San Jose outpost, Samsung could position itself to offer its technology to other companies, including an automaker.

23,2017-09-11,Jefferies says cryptocurrency mining market is strong for Nvidia and AMD  ,"David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., holds the Nvidia Xavier high-end computing module as he speaks during a keynote presentation at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Jan. 4, 2017.
 Nvidia and AMD are the best-performing stocks over the past year. One Wall Street firm predicts the strong returns will likely continue.
 Jefferies is bullish that cryptocurrency mining will boost demand for the chipmakers' products even after some on Wall Street have expressed concerns over the companies' digital currency exposure. ""We think that the risk of a 'crypto-driven' inventory correction driving material downside is low in the near term,"" Jefferies semiconductor analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a note to clients Monday, adding demand for graphics processors used in cryptocurrency mining were likely to ""remain healthy in 3Q."" Nvidia's stock is up nearly 180 percent in the past 12 months through midday Monday compared with the S&P 500's 17 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet. AMD shares are up 112 percent in the same time period, the No. 2 gain in the benchmark index.

 11:11  AM ET Mon, 11 Sept 2017 |  00:45 
 Lipacis reiterated his buy ratings for both chipmakers. He also reaffirmed his $180 and $19 price targets for Nvidia and AMD, respectively. Cryptocurrency miners use graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia to ""mine"" new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation. The analyst cited the price strength of bitcoin since July. The digital currency rose nearly 120 percent from its low in mid-July and is up almost 340 percent year to date through midday Monday, according to data from industry website CoinDesk. Lipacis noted even if digital currency prices drop in the future, the effect on the chipmakers will be more muted than it was in previous cycles. ""Both AMD and NVDA have introduced 'cryptospecific GPU SKUs' that have a low risk of competing with core gaming GPUs in secondary markets,"" he wrote. ""So should cryptocurrency prices dramatically decline again, we think that AMD's risk of competing with its own GPUs resold by miners in secondary markets is lower than the 2013-15 cycle."" The analyst also predicts cryptocurrency mining demand will be a viable growth market longer term for Nvidia and AMD:
 ""We actually believe that the technology they are based on, called Blockchain, which supports secure accounting of distributed ledgers, has applications in financial services beyond cryptocurrencies. We expect demand for Blockchain GPUs (including for cryptocurrencies) to continue to grow and become an important driver for GPU growth, even if with some degree of volatility.""

 One Wall Street firm is getting even more excited about Nvidia, even after the stock's stunning triple-digit performance during the past year.
 Evercore ISI raised its price target for the chipmaker to the highest among analyst firms, saying the company's products will dominate the artificial intelligence market.
""We hosted NVDA mgmt.

Muse wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""We are only at the cusp of AI's growth potential and NVIDIA is creating THE AI computing industry standard.""
 Muse reiterated his outperform rating and raised his price target for Nvidia to $250 from $180, representing 48 percent upside from Thursday's close. He now has the highest price target on the stock out of more than 30 analysts, according to FactSet. Two other firms have the second highest forecast at $200.
Muse noted that the company spent more than $10 billion in research and development to build its CUDA software programming platform, which supports building AI software.
""NVDA has created an industry standard for AI systems that will be nearly impossible to replicate,"" he wrote.
Nvidia's stock is up 170 percent in the past 12 months through Thursday compared with the S&P 500's 16 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
""We believe the tremendous growth opportunities led by AI in the Data Center and Automotive verticals supports a clear path to $10 in earnings power over the next 3-5 years,"" the analyst wrote.
The company generated earnings per share of $2.57 in fiscal 2017.
Nvidia shares rose 4 percent Friday shortly after the market open.

 Nvidia hits another all-time high   
 11:37  AM ET Mon, 18 Sept 2017 |  00:40 
 Nvidia shares are surging as Wall Street is growing more bullish on the company's artificial intelligence opportunity. 
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its price target for the chipmaker to the second highest among analyst firms, citing the company's product leadership in the gaming, data center and AI markets.
The move came two days after Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse raised his price target to a Street-high price target on a similar thesis.
 ""Our positive view on Nvidia is based on its underappreciated transformation from a traditional PC graphics chip vendor, into a supplier into high end gaming, enterprise graphics, cloud, accelerated computing and automotive markets,"" analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients Sunday.
""Similar to other large successful tech industries, we expect the $30bn AI chip market to also feature one dominant supplier – we think NVDA.""
Nvidia shares opened up 3 percent on Monday. The stock reached an all-time high on Friday, closing at $180.11.
Arya reiterated his buy and ""top pick"" ratings for Nvidia shares. He raised his price target for the stock to $210 from $185, representing 17 percent upside from Friday's close. He now has the second highest price target on the stock out of more than 30 analysts, according to FactSet. Evercore's Muse is the highest with a $250 12-month forecast.
Bank of America predicts data center capital spending will rise 21 percent in 2018 from an estimated 16.5 percent in 2017. Arya also said Google's AI product is a specialized chip compared with Nvidia's more general purpose processor, which is easier to program for different tasks.
""Incumbency matters and Nvidia has a much wider AI/machine learning ecosystem that will be tough to match,"" he wrote.
Nvidia's stock is up 187 percent in the past 12 months through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 17 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
""Separately we note NVDA's first mover advantage and growing influence in the multi trillion $ healthcare industry where AI/deep learning is being used for predictive analytics, image scanning and pathology assessments,"" the analyst wrote. ""Indeed about 50% of submitted papers at last week's Medical Imaging Computing conference (MICCAI) were on deep learning.""

 The four stocks that have doubled over the past year   
 4:54  PM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  03:09 
 Nvidia shares surged 6.3 percent Friday following a hyper-bullish report from Evercore ISI senior equity research analyst C.J. Muse. But it isn't immediately clear that the report presents much in the way of new information.
 Nvidia's recent run has been downright spectacular. Shares of the semiconductor company have nearly tripled in value over the past year, and the stock hit an all-time high of $180.11 in Friday trading.
But Muse's Friday morning report takes it to the next level, increasing the firm's price target from $180 to $250, blowing Wall Street's previously highest target of $200 out of the water.
 In the first sentence of the note, Muse provides some useful context for the call: ""We hosted NVDA mgmt. (CEO, CFO and IR) on the road with investors over the last few days in Boston and New York.""
""As for major takeaways, our sense is management believes that investors still severely underestimates the impact of AI and the size of the potential market,"" he continued. ""We are only at the cusp of AI's growth potential and NVIDIA is creating THE AI computing industry standard.""
It may indeed be useful for investors to know that Muse sniffed out bullishness on the part of the company's own management while Muse was providing Evercore ISI clients with access to them. But that leaves open the question of how the stock will manage to stage another 48 percent rally from its Thursday $169.40 close, which was the last stock price before the report was published.
Ultimately, it comes down to earnings. Without explicitly making a forecast to this effect, Muse writes in three places that the company has a ""clear path"" to earning $10 per share. This is a striking call; the company earned $3.63 per share over the past year, and Muse's official forecast only goes out to 2018, in which he foresees the company earning $3.80.
Yet Muse writes that ""the tremendous growth in opportunities led by AI in the Data Center and Automotive verticals supports a clear path to $10 in earnings power over the next 3-5 years ... with sustained growth thereafter.""
Muse then multiplies this soft $10 earnings estimate by 25, which he believes is the multiple at which the stock will trade at that time, and voila: $250.
Often this kind of analysis will involve an intermediary step, whereby an analyst will ""discount"" this expected price back to the present by dividing it by a number accounting for the amount of risk and the number of years until the outcome in the numerator is achieved. (For instance, let's say an estimate with this amount of risk will pay out 10 percent per year if it proves correct. In that case, $250 would be divided by 1 + 0.1 to the fifth power, or 1.61, leaving a price target of $155.)
Muse simply skips this step, leaving him free to stop at $250 and declare it his price target. He explains: ""some may push back on our not discounting back to 2018 from the 2020-2022 timeframe, and this view clearly has some merit. But considering the first mover advantage NVDA has in AI coupled with the CUDA ecosystem that is becoming the defacto standard for AI globally, we suspect that the company's multiple will be elevated for some time as growth investors will be willing to project beyond 2020-2022.""
The call, then, appears to assume demand for the stock from a particular type of investor. It leaves open the question of what math these investors themselves will be doing that leaves them free to ignore the risk that arises naturally when lofty expectations meet long time frames. This isn't the first time that Nvidia has inspired analysts to take a novel tact. When he raised his price target to $155 in May, Matthew Ramsay of Canaccord Genuity wrote: ""Our $155 price target is based on shares trading at the average of roughly 25x our base case [fiscal] 2021 ([calendar] 2020) non-GAAP EPS of $5.50 and roughly 25x our bull case estimate of $7.00.""
When this writer asked Ramsey why the price target is greater than the product of 25 and $5.50, he explained at the time that ""We've treated our more conservative base case as more of a bearish outcome given the fundamentals I see currently"" and acknowledged that ""we should clean up the vocabulary.""
However, when Ramsay once again raised his price target in August, this time to $190 in a report entitled ""The pullback folks have been waiting for,"" he explained it thus: ""Our $190 price target is based on shares trading at the average of roughly 25x our base case F2021 (C2020) non-GAAP EPS of $6.15 and roughly 27.5x our bull case estimate of $8.25.""
Of course, 25 times $6.15 is not $190, but $153.75 (before it is even discounted back to the present). When asked to clarify this time around, Ramsay explained in a Monday email that he made a ""Very intentional change in reference"" atop his two projected income statements, labeling one ""Base/Bear Case"" and the other ""Bull Case."" (The new wording is not reflected in the ""Valuation Methodology"" quoted above.)
Ramsay followed up his explanation of this adjustment by provided some context for how investors view the stock.
""Additionally, given I believe we are in the early innings of both the AI and Autonomous driving opportunities for NVIDIA, this is a debate I have with buyside investors rarely versus discussions on NVIDIA's technology differentiation, competition, and attempts to estimate/bound the size of these new large opportunities,"" he wrote.
Indeed, to Ramsay's point, one might assume that this type of numerical nitpicking is beside the point when it comes to a stock like Nvidia. That the stock did not rise on Friday because Muse floated a $10 earnings-per-share possibility, but because the analyst has a good sense of where the stock is going thanks to his industry expertise and exposure to management.
But Muse has not exactly had the hot hand on Nvidia. He had a hold rating starting at the end of 2014, when the stock was at about $20. He maintained that hold rating until December 2016, by which point the stock had quintupled to $100.
At this point, investors might worry that after underestimating the stock, he is now going a bit too far in the other direction.
On the other hand, they might be heartened by the potential that CEO Jensen Huang is indeed optimistic about his own company.

 Is Nvidia's stock due for a pullback?   
 7:00  PM ET Wed, 20 Sept 2017 |  00:57 
 As the stock of semiconductor manufacturer Nvidia tumbled in after-hours trading on news of a Tesla-AMD partnership focused on self-driving cars, CNBC's Jim Cramer had to figure out what to do next.
 Shares of Nvidia hit an all-time high on Monday following several analyst upgrades that cited the company's promising position in the fields of artificial intelligence, gaming and data centers.
But with the stock now falling from its highs, Cramer wouldn't blame investors for feeling uneasy about what's next for Nvidia.
 ""Perhaps after its rally and this AMD news, the stock actually deserves to get punished. Perhaps this is just one more buying opportunity, though,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""You have to know what you're doing and what could happen to the stock.""
So Cramer enlisted the help of technician Carolyn Boroden, the creator of FibonnacciQueen.com and one of Cramer's colleagues at RealMoney.com.
Boroden has a notable track record on predicting chipmakers' stock moves. In August, she said Nvidia's rally was far from over, predicting upside targets of $180 and $188 with a ceiling at $209.
So far, Nvidia's stock has followed Boroden's predicted path, which is based on Fibonacci ratios. She uses the medieval mathematical system to find the levels at which a given stock is likely to change its path based on past swings. She also uses it to find the dates when trajectory changes are the most likely to help investors find the best times to buy or sell.
With Boroden's methodology in mind, Cramer turned to the daily chart of Nvidia.
 Boroden noticed that the stock has already made a 127.2 percent extension of its last swing. An extension, or how much lower a stock's current decline is than its previous one, tends to mark the end of a stock's rally, which means Nvidia could be due for a bigger pullback, Cramer said.
Moreover, Nvidia's longest rallies have lasted between 25 and 29 trading days, and Monday marked the most recent rally's 25th day. Cramer said the pullback may have already started given the negative action in Nvidia, which means its rally could be tapering out.
Boroden also found that Nvidia tends to lose momentum after running up anywhere from 35 to 42 points. The last time this happened, the stock got hit before restarting its climb.
Cramer doesn't necessarily think that pattern will repeat itself, but he thought it was worth noting that Nvidia's shares gained $38.29 from their low on August 11 to their high on Monday, putting it right in the range that indicates the rally may have run its course.
So while Cramer's charitable trust, which owns shares of Nvidia, isn't taking any action, Boroden would bless some profit-taking if the stock holds up its historical patterns and starts to decline.
And for investors who don't own Nvidia, they could be about to get a great buying opportunity in the next week or so, Cramer said.
""Here's the bottom line: I like Nvidia, but I love protecting your profits even more,"" Cramer said. ""The charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, suggest that Nvidia could be due for a $10 to $30 pullback after its recent run, and if you're nimble, maybe you want to try to sidestep some of that decline. More important, if Nvidia is pulverized like that, well, maybe you get a chance to own a piece of this great semiconductor company with a remarkable number of strengths and very few weaknesses, even as this potential loss of the Tesla business to AMD could certainly be one of them.""

 AMD, Nvidia shares drop after Intel unveils new chip's stellar gaming performance   
 4:57  PM ET Mon, 25 Sept 2017 |  00:42 
 Intel shareholders' lackluster year compared with its chip peers may be turning around with the launch of its new gaming-focused processors.
 The chip maker unveiled its latest Core desktop processors on Monday, proclaiming up to 25 percent frame-rate improvements for PC gaming versus the previous models.
""Our 8th Gen Intel Core desktop processors deliver tremendous improvements across the board and — for gamers, in particular — offer an unbeatable experience,"" Anand Srivatsa, general manager of Desktop Platform Group at Intel, said in the announcement.""We are laser-focused on giving the enthusiast community the ultimate desktop experience, from chart-topping performance to a platform that can flex with their needs.""
 The processors will be available for sale on Oct. 5. 
Intel shares outperformed midday Monday, falling 0.3 percent compared with iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF's 2 percent drop, a 3.8 percent fall for Nvidia shares and 3 percent decline for AMD stock.
One technology industry analyst said the market reaction may mean Intel's latest product offering could be bad news for AMD, which also makes desktop processors.
""I believe the [market] sentiment is driven primarily by belief that AMD poses less of a threat [to Intel],"" Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, wrote in an email.
At first blush, it may seem Intel's processors may not be a direct competition for Nvidia's graphics cards. However, if enthusiasts can improve gaming performance with a new desktop processor, it could take budget dollars away from graphics card upgrades.
Nvidia's stock is up nearly 165 percent in the past 12 months through midday Monday compared with the S&P 500's 15 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet. AMD and Intel shares are up 97 percent and roughly flat respectively in the same time period.
AMD and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Intel referred to the statement by its executive in the product announcement for its comment.

 Tesla may be choosing Intel over Nvidia to make chips for the ""infotainment"" system in Tesla cars, Bloomberg reported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. 
 Intel shares were up slightly following the news.
Intel chips will now power the on-board information and entertainment system behind the large screens in the center console of Tesla cars. Drivers control most of the car's features through those screens. Tesla's Model 3 sedan, for example is practically devoid of any switches or dials on its dashboard, requiring users to do just about everything through the on-screen system.

 Why the top stock sell-off isn't based on fundamentals   
 6:31  PM ET Tue, 26 Sept 2017 |  01:04 
 Declines in some of the stock market's highest-flying technology stocks may have investors second-guessing, so CNBC's Jim Cramer took to the fundamentals to help explain the drops.
 ""Let me give you my take on the dramatic see-saw-like action in the leaders of this market,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""First, let's tackle the real cause of the weakness that started last week: technology. Come on, you all know the epicenter here. It's Apple.""
Recent talk of the tech giant's iPhone 8 sales being worse than expected has weighed on shares of Apple as well as its suppliers.
 Cramer said the worries were overblown, particularly since Apple can't possibly know how many phones it will sell before it sells them.
""Needless to say, the bias on Wall Street always seems to be not that you should own Apple, but you should trade it. In the end, most people who try to trade Apple end up buying high and selling low — the opposite of what you're supposed to do,"" Cramer said.
The ""Mad Money"" host compared the stock of Apple to legendary boxer Muhammad Ali, who inspired the term ""GOAT,"" or ""Greatest of All Time."" Betting against Apple would be like betting against Ali, he said — odds are, you'll lose.
Cramer added that, next to other consumer product companies like Clorox, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, Apple's valuation is still the cheapest of the cohort.
""So, the proximate sell-off cause, at least number one? Apple. Now, I am saying it's been pretty neutralized. Sure, the stock can go lower, but at these levels, it's beginning to reflect the failure of the iPhone 9, and that product doesn't exist,"" Cramer said.
The second issue plaguing the market is concern over a slowdown in the cloud, a central feature of FAANNG, Cramer's extended acronym for the high-flying stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Nvidia and Google, now Alphabet.
Analysts were struck by Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen's comments in a conference call that suggested cloud growth was temporarily slowing in one line of Adobe's business.
To add to the pressure, Tesla announced a partnership with Advanced Micro Devices to build an artificial intelligence chip for self-driving cars, a relationship that could curb Tesla's existing rapport with Nvidia. But Cramer said the market was exaggerating that loss as well.
""Remember, the cloud lives in the data center. So if the cloud's slowing, the data center should be slowing, too,"" he said. ""Yet last night Nvidia announced that its new line of chips won business from three of the largest Chinese data center operators out there: Alibaba, TenCent and Baidu, which are growing like mad. I'll match those orders against a defeat at Tesla any day of the week.""
Overall, Cramer attributed the selling in these stocks to mutual and hedge funds wanting to rake in solid quarterly profits and some large hedge funds facing redemption, in which managers are required to raise capital to cover costs.
""Bottom line? We're at the end of a good quarter in a good year, and we're seeing profit-taking and forced selling of the winners while some money's going into cheaper stocks and, when you put it that way, there's a kernel of rationality to the entire move,"" the ""Mad Money"" host concluded. ""Does it mean the selling is over in the high fliers? Nope, it's not the end of the month yet. Does it mean it could be over soon? Maybe, but only when we hear all of those scary stories about crashes of yore in the month of October. But alas, that could give you an even better buying opportunity.""

 Another Wall Street firm is getting even more bullish on Nvidia, even after the stock's amazing market-leading run during the past year.
 Citi Research reiterated its buy rating and raised its price target for Nvidia shares, predicting the chipmaker will generate earnings significantly above expectations next year.
Nvidia shares rose 2 percent shortly after Friday's market open after the report.
 ""We expect Nvidia stock to grow into its multiple on strong earnings growth over the next three years, and exposure to some of the fastest growth secular end markets likes deep learning, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars,"" analyst Atif Malik wrote in a note to clients Friday.
Nvidia's stock is up 161 percent in the past 12 months through Thursday compared with the S&P 500's 17 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
Malik increased his price target for Nvidia to $210 from $185, representing 19.5 percent upside from Thursday's close.
The analyst cited the company's data center cloud computing deals with Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent announced on Monday. 
In addition, the firm recently surveyed 342 U.S. gamers. It found 83 percent of consumers who intend to buy a graphics card are planning to purchase Nvidia cards, up from 75 percent in the previous March survey.
""Our updated proprietary gaming survey indicates limited threat of new AMD ... Vega graphics cards keeping our above consensus C17/18 gaming sales expectations intact,"" he wrote.
Malik estimates Nvidia will generate earnings per share of $5.01 in fiscal 2019 versus the $3.97 Wall Street consensus.
In similar moves, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Evercore ISI raised their Nvidia price targets earlier this month.

 Nvidia unveils computer to drive 'fully autonomous robotaxis'   
 12:20  PM ET Tue, 10 Oct 2017 |  00:35 
 Nvidia on Tuesday unveiled what it says is the world's first artificial intelligence computer system designed to drive fully autonomous robotaxis, and said it plans to make a fleet of autonomous trucks. 
 The company claims the new system, code named Pegasus, will handle Level 5 driverless vehicles — vehicles that can be operated entirely by sensors and computers, with no human interaction.
Nvidia shares jumped more than 3 percent on the news after the market opened Tuesday. 
 The system will include several chips, including Nvidia's next-generation GPU, which is due out next year, plus artificial intelligence software, in a package that the company boasts is the ""size of a license plate"" — a huge reduction from the massive racks of computers required today. The system's capabilities represent more than a tenfold increase over the current system, Nvidia said in a news release.
""It is designed for truly level 5 driving,"" meaning no steering wheel, no gas or brake pedal, Nvidia automotive senior director said Danny Shapiro on a call with reporters on Monday.  Nvidia said it is working with several companies on developing robotaxis, but Shapiro declined to name them.
Pegasus will be available to Nvidia automotive partners in the second half of 2018. Pricing was not disclosed.
The company also announced it will partner with automotive supplier ZF to make a test fleet of autonomous delivery trucks for Deutsche Post DHL Group by 2018. DPDHL is the world's largest mail and package delivery service, Shapiro said.
The fleet will combine sensors, cameras, radar and lidar, and the ZF ProAI self-driving system, which is based on Drive PX.
The technology is expected to improve DPDHL's efficiency considerably by enabling 24/7 hour package delivery. 
The company is also allowing some designers and developers access to its Holodeck virtual reality development platform, which lets designers test ideas in a realistic 3-D world.

 Nvidia's strong competitive position in the artificial intelligence market is unmatched, according to a top Wall Street firm.
 Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on the chipmaker's shares and raised its price target to the second highest of the 33 analysts who cover the stock, saying Nvidia's products will continue to dominate the machine-learning markets.
""We remain very bullish on Nvidia,"" analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""Equipped with Volta (new GPU architecture) and TensorRT (high performance deep learning inference optimizer), we believe Nvidia is better-positioned to address the Inferencing [machine learning AI] opportunity, a market historically dominated by CPUs (i.e., Intel).""
 Hari raised his price target for Nvidia shares to $217 from $193. The new target is 15 percent higher than Tuesday's closing price and the second highest among analysts, according to FactSet. Evercore ISI has the most bullish target, at $250.
Nvidia spends nearly $2.5 billion a year to invest in its technology platform, Hari wrote. ""Management believes (and we agree) that Nvidia has a sustainable competitive moat in the Datacenter — specifically, its scale,"" he wrote.
Nvidia shares hit an all-time high Tuesday after it announced its Pegasus artificial intelligence computer system, which will enable fully autonomous robotaxis.The company said more than 25 firms were already developing robotaxi offerings using Nvidia technology, according to the analyst.
Nvidia shares have rallied nearly 190 percent during the previous 12 months through midday Wednesday, compared with the market's 19 percent gain. That performance ranks first in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
Its shares are up 0.8 percent midday Wednesday after the report.

 Soaring to a fresh record on Tuesday, the white-hot semiconductor stock is now up 181 percent during the past year, and an incredible 1,021 percent in the past three.
What makes the run even more impressive is that the stock has essentially only gone in one direction. The stock hasn't fallen by more than 8 percent in a calendar month since January 2016.
 At this point, views on the stock might to come down to how one cares to view stocks in general. Those who pore over income statements, valuation comparisons and analyst estimates in search of value might tend to turn a sharp eye to the stock — which is now trading at nearly 50 times the earnings expected over the next 12 months.
For those who put their faith in price alone, the fact that the shares have risen in the past might serve as evidence enough that they will rise in the future.
""With a stock that's up 182 percent over the past year, you don't need a trend-following technician to tell you to buy Nvidia,"" Rich Ross, head of technical analysis at Evercore ISI, quipped Tuesday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" ""What you need me for is to tell you not to sell it — and by all means, don't short the stock.""
Breaking down a one-year chart of the stock, Ross noted that ""if you look back to November of last year, that third-quarter earnings release, it set the stage for a one-month surge, from that release in November to that peak in December, of 64 percent.""
""I'm not telling you we're going up 64 percent before year-end, but I'm not not telling you that can happen,"" Ross added coyly.
Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager at S&P Global, sees the stock a bit differently.
""This is definitely a pop, and we've seen just a huge increase in Nvidia's valuations compared to the semi industry,"" Gibbs said Tuesday on ""Power Lunch.""
""One thing that investors have to be wary of is that going forward, they're going from about 35 percent growth down to about 7 in the next year. So that's a big drop in the rate of growth, and at these prices, they're just looking really expensive,"" Gibbs said.
Indeed, she points out that the stock has even managed to run ahead of Wall Street analysts' expectations. While the average research analyst rates the stock buy or overweight, the median price target, according to FactSet data, is actually $180 — 5 percent below the stock's Tuesday closing price of $188.93.
""The train has already left the station for NVDA,"" Gibbs said.
Of course, to Ross' point, that doesn't mean that those betting against the stock won't continue to get run over.

Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang attends an event during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan May 30, 2017.
 Nvidia shares will soar due to the company's booming chip sales in new high-growth technology markets, according to a one Wall Street firm.
 Needham reiterated its buy rating on the chipmaker's shares and raised its price target to match the highest of the 34 research shops that cover the stock, saying Nvidia's products will dominate the artificial intelligence and autonomous driving markets.
Nvidia's ""24-year history in parallel processing and the development of its ubiquitous CUDA platform has uniquely positioned the company to capitalize on the explosion of 'intelligence machines' – hundreds of millions of AVs [autonomous vehicles] and trillions of IoT [internet of things] devices, all of which will generate significant network complexity and network consumption,"" analyst Rajvindra Gill wrote in a note to clients Friday entitled ""Entering A World Where Software Will Write Itself: AI Is the Killer App for GPU.""
 ""We've already seen tangible evidence of pervasive GPU [graphics processing unit] adoption across all the major cloud / Hyperscale OEMs as well major enterprise vendors such as Oracle and SAP using NVDA's Volta AI platform for machine learning.""
Gill raised his price target for Nvidia shares to $250 from $200. The new target is 31 percent higher than Thursday's closing price and matches Evercore ISI as the most bullish target on Wall Street.
The analyst cited how only 15 of the world's top 500 supercomputers use GPU chips. He predicts 100 percent of these supercomputers will be GPU accelerated over the next five years.
The company announced this week its Pegasus artificial intelligence computer system, which will enable fully autonomous robotaxis. 
""Virtually all carmakers, transportation as a service companies, as well as startups are using NVIDIA AI in the development of Level 5 vehicles,"" he wrote.
Nvidia shares have rallied nearly 190 percent during the previous 12 months through Thursday, compared with the market's 20 percent gain. That performance ranks first in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
Its shares are up 1 percent midday Friday after the report.

Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO, Nvidia
 Nvidia shares will rally because of the growth of the technology industries that use its chips, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Mizuho Securities reiterated its buy rating for the chipmaker's shares and raised its price target, citing solid pricing for its graphics processing units, which are used in the digital currency and graphics card markets.
""We believe NVDA continues to see strong underlying trends in cryptocurrency and gaming ahead of company expectations, even as GPU pricing remains stable post launch,"" analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote in a note to clients Sunday.
 Rakesh raised his price target for Nvidia shares to $220 from $180. The new target is 13 percent higher than Friday's closing price.
""We believe NVDA guided the OctQ with expectations of a cool down in the crypto-currency market, but continued GPU pricing strength through the quarter could position it for an upside surprise,"" he wrote.
Bitcoin hit another record high on Friday to more than $5,800, up over 480 percent year to date. Cryptocurrency miners use graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia to ""mine"" new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation.
Nvidia's latest chips provide 40 times to 100 times the performance of traditional central processing units for artificial intelligence applications, the analyst noted.
Nvidia shares have rallied nearly 200 percent during the previous 12 months through midday Monday, compared with the market's 20 percent gain. That performance ranks first in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
The shares are up 1.4 percent midday Monday after the report.

Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO of Nvidia, holds a Nvidia Drive PX Auto-Pilot Computer during the GPU Technology Conference in San Jose, California, last March.
 Nvidia, the best-performing stock over the past year, will thrive from the artificial intelligence technology trend, according to one Wall Street analyst.
 Jefferies reiterated its buy rating for Nvidia shares, predicting the chipmaker will report profits above expectations in fiscal 2019, which begins in February.
Nvidia's graphics processing chips have become popular with gaming, and its Volta chip is proving to be popular with AI applications, something that will ""translate to upside surprises over the next 18-24 months,"" semiconductor analyst Mark Lipacis wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""Nvidia remains a top pick.""
 Nvidia shares declined slightly shortly after Monday's market open.
The company introduced its Volta line of artificial intelligence processors on May 10.
Its stock is up 192 percent in the past 12 months through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 20 percent gain. That is the best performance in the entire S&P 500, according to FactSet.
Lipacis raised his price target for Nvidia shares to $230 from $180. The new target is 17 percent above Friday's closing price.
The analyst predicts the company will eventually capture 80 percent of the artificial intelligence chip market's profit pool. He noted the technology business histories of Apple and Microsoft. Those two companies were able to obtain the vast majority of industry profits during the rise of smartphones and PCs, respectively.
Lipacis forecasts Nvidia fiscal 2019 earnings-per-share of $4.12 versus the Wall Street consensus of $4.00.

 Cramer Remix: Why you should wait to hear Nvidia’s earnings before pulling the trigger   
 7:06  PM ET Fri,  3 Nov 2017 |  01:10 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer told investors to hang on to the stock market's ""benign"" action on Friday ahead of another potentially raucous week of earnings.
 ""You combine a good, not too hot, not too cold non-farm payroll number from the Labor Department that had little wage inflation, throw in some blockbuster earnings and voila, you get the kind of benign action that gives you multiple opportunities to make money,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
From the skyrocketing shares of Apple and the stabilizing health care space, Cramer saw plenty of opportunities in Friday's market, but wondered if they would follow through to next week, which will get an earnings report from Nvidia on Thursday.
 Even though this Cramer-fave semiconductor stock has run so much, Cramer still sees a lot to like, particularly given the strong demand for chips for self-driving cars and graphics processors used for gaming systems like the Nintendo Switch.
""But the stock does have a habit of trading down after it reports, so I want you to wait until we hear the conference call before you do any buying,"" Cramer said.
 Crazy action in Activision Blizzard and Starbucks

Kevin Johnson, CEO of Starbucks
 When the stock market acts unexpectedly, Cramer says you just have to roll with the punches, like investors did with the stocks of Activision Blizzard and Starbucks on Friday.
Both companies reported their quarterly earnings after Thursday's bell. Activision Blizzard, the video game giant behind ""Call of Duty"" and ""Candy Crush,"" beat analyst estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Shares popped in early-hours trading on the better-than-expected results.
Meanwhile, shares of Starbucks shed more than 3 percent after the coffeemaker reported a revenue miss, slowing domestic same-store sales and slashed long-term guidance.
""But when the market opened this morning, Activision Blizzard's stock collapsed while Starbucks' stock soared,"" Cramer said. ""How the heck is that even possible? Well, you see, it's all in the expectations.""
 Sexy spinoffs
 Mike Blake | Reuters
DuPont products are shown for sale in a hardware store in National City, California, December 9, 2015.
 After DuPont spun off paint manufacturer Axalta in 2012, the new stock initially spiked before spending a year trading sideways. This year, AkzoNobel expressed interest in buying Axalta, and Axalta's stock surged.
It's no secret that Cramer loves corporate breakups, but spinoffs, when a company separates from a smaller, undervalued segment, are slightly different.
""Look, not every spinoff is a success. I mean, it's just not that easy, right? But if you know what to look for, a good spinoff can often became a big winner,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""So let's talk about what works in a spinoff, what leads to an Axalta-type situation, and who could be the next Axalta.""
 Integrated Device Technology CEO on 'next leg of growth'
 With semiconductor demand sky-high across industries, Integrated Device Technology President and CEO Gregory Waters told CNBC that his company has invested its way into automotives for its ""next leg of growth.""
""We're bringing out new devices, like all sorts of smart-senses for automobiles. We'll introduce devices in early next year that take these complex safety avoidance, autonomous-driving-type devices and reduce that to a set of chips that'll fit in the palm of your hand,"" Waters told Cramer on Friday.
So many of the current electro-mechanical systems that power in cars and other forms of transportation are large, unseemly and very costly, Waters said.
""Those things cost just south of $10,000 per copy. So they're never going to make it into the high-volume transportation. We are working on a set of devices that will take, for instance, what's called this Lidar technology – think of it as kind of an optical radar – and reduce that to a cost point that, to an automobile manufacturer, will cost between $100 and $200 bucks. And at that cost point, this stuff goes everywhere, not just cars,"" the CEO said.
From farm equipment to drones, chips like Integrated Device Technology's will be pervasive as the need for semiconductors grows, Waters told Cramer.
""We think this segment has legs,"" he said. ""I think the imagination for what's going to come to cars and transportation in general is just starting, and we have just entered that as another leg to the growth stool.""
 Lightning Round: A lofty GOL
 In Cramer's lightning round, he shared his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes: ""It's up 193 percent. I would probably say it's up too much. You have to wait for a pullback on that one. We can't chase that. It's just not disciplined enough, I've got to be honest about it.""
Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc.: ""We kind of like it. We like it. But remember: really risky and long term.""
Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Nvidia, Activision Blizzard, Starbucks and DowDuPont.

 AMD shares surge on a report of laptop chip deal with Intel to fight off Nvidia   
 11:08  AM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  00:45 
 AMD shares are rising on the announcement the chipmaker will collaborate with Intel to compete with Nvidia in the laptop chip market.
 ""Our collaboration with Intel expands the installed base for AMD Radeon GPUs and brings to market a differentiated solution for high-performance graphics,"" said Scott Herkelman, vice president and general manager, AMD Radeon Technologies Group, in the press release.
""This new semi-custom GPU puts the performance and capabilities of Radeon graphics into the hands of an expanded set of enthusiasts who want the best visual experience possible.""
 Intel revealed the chip will be for thin and lightweight laptops that are capable of playing complex video games.
Shares of AMD surged 5 percent Monday morning, while Nvidia shares traded roughly flat. Intel's stock rose 0.8 percent.
AMD shares are down since it reported third-quarter financial results last month. The company gave gross profit margin guidance of 35 percent for the fourth quarter, below some estimates. 
Its shares are now down 2 percent year to date through Friday versus the S&P 500's 16 percent return.
Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""This is a previous undisclosed win and as with other customer announcements, AMD will not disclose the dollar amount or specifics of the win,"" an AMD spokesperson wrote in an email. ""Please note this is not a licensing deal and there is no transfer or license of IP"" to Intel.

 Nvidia post earnings beat, gives strong fourth-quarter revenue guidance   
 7:53  PM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  01:01 
 Nvidia reported earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations.
 Here's how the company did:
 EPS: $1.33 vs. 94 cents expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $2.64 billion vs. $2.36 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters 
 Shares initially fell as much as 2 percent in after-hours trading Thursday but later ticked up more than a percent.
Revenue came in 32 percent higher than the year-ago quarter, and earnings jumped 41 percent year over year, according to the company release.
The company raised its dividend 7 percent to 15 cents a share and intends to return $1.25 billion to shareholders during the next fiscal year.
The company reported $501 million in datacenter revenue, which includes sales of GPUs to cloud providers like Amazon Web Services, beating analyst estimates of $461 million and marking a 20 percent increase from last quarter.
""We've been steadfast with the excitement of accelerated computing for datacenters and I think this is just the beginning of it all,"" CEO Jensen Huang said on its earnings call.
Analysts forecast double-digit growth in revenue and earnings year over year for the third quarter, representing a slowing in the chipmaker's record-setting run.
The company staked a claim in the competitive chip market with impressive graphics and gaming capabilities, but has recently broadened its reach with hardware specifically designed for autonomous driving and mining cryptocurrency.
Shares were up more than 190 percent on the year ahead of the earnings report, making it the best performing stock in the S&P 500 for much of the year. 
The company issued fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $2.65 billion, above analyst estimates of $2.44 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.

 The charts are pointing to more gains for Nvidia and the chips: Technician   
 6:08  PM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  05:12 
 Nvidia shares are surging as Wall Street is growing more bullish on the company's opportunities in key secular growth markets. The chipmaker reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings and guidance Thursday.
 Its data center segment sales, where its cards are used for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, came in at $501 million versus the $461 million FactSet consensus estimate. Gaming-related sales also beat expectations with $1.56 billion in revenue versus the $1.28 billion estimate.
The quarter and outlook was ""well above our recently raised expectations, with upside coming primarily from the gaming segment,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote in a note to clients Friday.
 Nvidia shares closed at an all-time high Friday, rising more than 5 percent. The stock is up 203 percent in the past 12 months through Thursday compared with the S&P 500's 19 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 1 in the entire S&P 500.
Analysts believe Nvidia has an unstoppable leadership position in the key technology growth trends.
""The most important reason to own NVDA is its 10+ year heritage developing and expanding a single hardware (GPU) + software (CUDA) platform. This platform has proven to be continuously leverage-able in some of the biggest and fastest growing markets in technology including gaming, artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous cars, and virtual reality,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients Thursday.
""NVDA's proprietary CUDA application programming interface has become the de-facto software platform for AI.""
Arya reiterated his buy rating and increased his price target to $251 a share from $210, representing 22 percent upside to Thursday's close.
Even the company's skeptics are giving up on their negative views after the results.
""We've been bearish for most of this year, anticipating that a slowdown in gaming would drive sharp revenue deceleration in 2017,"" Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah wrote in a note to clients Friday entitled ""Falling On Our Sword and Upgrading.""
""However, Nvidia demonstrated good diversity in gaming with Nintendo Switch and crypto-currency, offsetting weakness in core gaming earlier in the year. In addition, Datacenter results have been stronger than forecast and we underestimated the value the market would assign to this franchise.""
Shah raised his rating to neutral from reduce and his price target to $190 from $110 for Nvidia shares. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.

Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang attends an event during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan May 30, 2017.
 Wall Street rarely talks about its mistakes, but BMO Capital Markets admitted in a note to clients that it messed up with its bearish call for Nvidia shares.
 The firm's analyst raised his rating for the chipmaker to market perform from underperform, saying his predictions and forecasts were way off base.
""We have been reluctant to change our view, but now recognize that our underperform call did not work out,"" BMO's Ambrish Srivastava wrote in a note to clients Sunday.
 ""Our negative stance to date was based largely on our view that the gaming business would see a marked deceleration in CY17 vs. CY16. However, the diversity in the business with wins at Nintendo, and help from the cryptocurrency market, has enabled the business to sustain at a higher level than what we were modeling."" Nvidia shares closed at an all-time high Friday, a day after it reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter earnings results. The stock is up 102.5 percent year to date through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 15 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 4 in the entire S&P 500.
Srivastava raised his price target for Nvidia shares to $200 from $135. The new target is 7.5 percent below Friday's closing price.
About 19 percent of Nvidia's sales are in its data center segment, where its cards are used for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.
""NVIDIA has done a very good job in capitalizing on the demand for AI/ML, and primarily on the training side, where the company really has no competition,"" Srivastava wrote. ""While we are ourselves believers in the secular trend to heterogeneous computing, we have been wrong on the tailwind for NVIDIA's business in this market.""
Srivastava lowered his rating for the company's shares to underperform from market perform on Feb. 23. Nvidia stock is up 115 percent since the downgrade through Friday.
""Additionally, NVIDIA has also demonstrated a far higher amount of leverage in its model than we had been anticipating. The recently-reported quarter was an example of the earnings power in the model,"" he wrote.
Nvidia stock traded down 1.3 percent on Monday.

 Shares of Nvidia are about to heat up   
 3:52  PM ET Thu, 16 Nov 2017 |  03:11 
 Shares of Nvidia have almost doubled this year, and Todd Gordon says the party's not over yet for one of the year's hottest chip stocks.
 Nvidia shares have rallied more than 98 percent this year, making it the sixth-best-performing stock in the S&P 500.
""The strong story stock in the chip space here has done quite an interesting technical pattern here, pulling back into what I see is a good zone of established longs,"" the TradingAnalysis.com founder said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""
 Gordon is referring specifically to what he's calling an island reversal. In his own words, the trader describes an island reversal as consisting of a gap against a trend, in this case an uptrend, followed by a gap back in the initial trend direction. The stock has fallen 3 percent from its high last week, but a recent gap back up in Nvidia stock leads Gordon to believe that the chipmaker has returned to the uptrend it had followed, paving the way for more highs ahead.
""This stock is just all over the place. I love the upside here to go and retest the old highs up around $220,"" he said.
 To play Nvidia for a move higher, Gordon wants to buy the Dec. 8 weekly 212.5-strike calls and sell the Dec. 8 220-strike calls for $3.10, or $310 per options spread. If Nvidia were to rally and close above $220, or roughly 4 percent from current levels, by Dec. 8 expiration, then Gordon could make a maximum reward of $440 on the trade.
But if Nvidia were to close below $212.50 on Dec. 8, then Gordon could lose the $310 premium he paid to make the trade. In order to avoid the loss, Gordon establishes a certain point for him to step out of the trade.
""If the $3.10 of premium we're outlaying gets cut in half, because the trade is not working, down to about $1.60 or so, cut the trade, contain the risk and simply move on,"" he said.
Nvidia rallied 1 percent on Thursday, still sitting near its all-time highs.

 Some of the market's best-performing technology stocks so far this year are tanking Wednesday. 
 So-called FANG stocks all dropped with Facebook down 4 percent, Amazon off by 2.7 percent, Netflix falling 5.5 percent and Google-parent Alphabet lower by 2.4 percent.

Semiconductor names are also falling. Nvidia shares dropped 6.7 percent, while Micron fell 8.7 percent. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF declined 4.2 percent.
 As popular tech stocks fell, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund rose 1.7 percent. And the Dow Jones industrial average was still up almost 80 points even with the tech drop.
Nasdaq Composite declined more than 1 percent because of the drop in tech, on pace for its biggest fall in three months.

 Trading Nation: Hot Nvidia trade cools off   
 3:06  PM ET Wed, 29 Nov 2017 |  02:54 
 Shares of Nvidia tanked as much as 11 percent from its recent intraday high, but Todd Gordon says this could just be the best time to buy.
 The TradingAnalysis.com founder said the charts are showing that Nvidia actually has room to rally before the stock enters overbought territory. Gordon pointed out that since 2002, the stock has sat in a parallel uptrend, and that upside resistance on the chart doesn't actually appear until $250.
 For more proof that fear about Wednesday's volatility in Nvidia could be overblown, Gordon looked back to September 2015. Since then, he said, the stock has seen three corrections of 27 percent, 21 percent and 18 percent, but he pointed out that the corrections became smaller each time. 
The stock fell 6.78 percent Wednesday to close at $196.42. Gordon said he would be concerned if a bigger correction breaks that trend.
""What we would have to see for this break is an 18 percent or 20 percent correction,"" he said on the ""Trading Nation"" segment in CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" ""That would bring you down to about $179 [and] would break the series of lower corrections.""
""So until we start breaking $180, I would say this is very much to be expected, and maybe even a buying opportunity,"" he added.
In Thursday's premarket, the stock was up about 1 percent.
 Chantico Global CEO Gina Sanchez, however, said that despite the consecutive strong earnings beats Nvidia has recently seen, two things may ultimately hit the stock. She said there's been ""a dramatic rise"" in the use of Nvidia machines for cryptocurrencies, and a giant sell-off in bitcoin on Wednesday speaks to the volatility of the cryptocurrency space.
Second, Sanchez said, the rise of insider selling in Nvidia could be a warning sign for investors.
""You're seeing some significant insider selling on Nvidia, particularly the CEO who rarely sells massive amounts of shares,"" Sanchez said on ""Power Lunch."" ""And so I do think that is an important element to watch.""
Despite the sell-off, Nvidia was still up 84 percent this year as of Wednesday's close.

 Nvidia CEO reveals the company's latest GPU at A.I. conference   
 2:13  PM ET Fri,  8 Dec 2017 |  00:55 
 Nvidia on Thursday announced the launch of its latest graphics card for artificial intelligence.
 CEO Jensen Huang showed off the Titan V graphics processing unit for desktop PCs, which employs Nvidia's seventh-generation Volta architecture, for the first time at a major AI conference in Long Beach, Calif.
The new GPU delivers 110 teraflops of performance, or nine times that of the comparative model from Nvidia's previous architecture, the Titan Xp, which was announced in April. But like  Nvidia's Tesla V100 GPU for data centers, which was unveiled in May, the new Titan V is more clearly oriented toward AI than previous generations. 
 The news comes amid a rush to deliver ever more powerful computing resaurces for AI. In the past few years Nvidia's GPUs have become widely used for a trendy type of AI called deep learning. Intel recently announced plans to develop its own GPUs that will compete with Nvidia, but, at the same time, Intel has recently begun shipping Nervana chips tailor-made for AI. 
The new Nvidia GPUs are meant to go inside people's PCs, rather than in data centers. But researchers, scientists and engineers can take advantage of GPUs from cloud infrastructure providers like Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft. Google has revealed tensor processing units that can be used in the place of GPUs — but they will only be accessible from Google's cloud, unlike the new Titan V.
Nvidia stock has risen 101 percent in the past year, according to FactSet.

Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors
 One of Wall Street's top strategists and a longtime bitcoin fan has unveiled his top stock ideas to clients as a way to play the cryptocurrency craze.
 Fundstrat's Tom Lee was the first major strategist to issue an official price target on bitcoin and now becomes the first to give clients direct bitcoin equity plays.
Many investment mandates require managers to steer clear of volatile assets and stick to traditional equity markets; despite bitcoin's stellar success over recent weeks, the cryptocurrency may be too volatile for standard investment rules.
 In addition to recommending stocks, Lee noted his $25,000 year-end target for the price of one bitcoin.
""We believe investors should have exposure to blockchain, particularly given bitcoin has essentially zero correlation to equities, bonds and commodities — hence, as a portfolio strategy, bitcoin is a good diversification tool,"" wrote Lee in a note Friday.
The digital asset took Wall Street by storm Thursday, jumping from $13,000 to highs above $19,000 in roughly one day. Bitcoin has since cooled off a bit, now trading just under $16,000.
The first group of bitcoin plays Lee highlighted includes the CME Group, Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) and Goldman Sachs. 
Cboe, the largest U.S. options exchange, announced in August its plans to launch its own bitcoin derivatives trading products, offering cash-settled bitcoin futures to both institutional and retail investors. They begin trading Sunday evening. Bitcoin fans argue that the launch of such products by Cboe and others help legitimize the trade and may help stabilize the otherwise volatile token.
For its part, CME followed suit in October with Chairman Terry Duffy saying, ""Given increasing client interest in the evolving cryptocurrency markets, we have decided to introduce a bitcoin futures contract."" Fundstrat's Lee included Goldman in the group because he expects the bank ""to be the first investment bank to be involved in bitcoin trading.""
Though options exchanges and investment banks may see upside thanks to the bitcoin mania, technology and chip companies are also set to climb, added Lee. Chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices that produce graphics processing units (GPUs) necessary for bitcoin ""mining"" should perform well if bitcoin presses upward.

Nvidia founder, President and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang
 ""GPUs are used by miners for many tokens other than bitcoin. Bitcoin mining is almost exclusively via ASICs (specialized chips),"" explained Lee. ""But as blockchain grows, and as transactions grow, mining will grow and therefore require more GPUs.""
Both Nvidia and AMD were higher Friday, each up more than 0.5 percent.
Lee rounded out his top picks with Overstock and Square. 
Online retailer and blockchain incubator Overstock has exposure to digital currency through its Medici Ventures segment and was the first major retailer to accept digital currency bitcoin as payment back in 2014. Earlier this year, Medici subsidiary tZERO announced a joint venture to trade digital coins launched in initial coin offerings in September; shares of Overstock have climbed about 90 percent since the announcement.
Even before its foray into bitcoin, Square had been a promising prospect on the Street, by providing software and hardware technology to turn mobile devices into point-of-sale solutions. 
Shares of Square spiked after its CEO, Jack Dorsey announced in November that the company will allow users to buy and sell bitcoin through its app, though Lee cautioned that the service isn't a full bitcoin exchange. Square's stock is up more than 180 percent this year.

 Semiconductor stocks making a comeback?   
 4:48  PM ET Thu,  7 Dec 2017 |  03:00 
 After surging for most of the year, Nvidia has fallen around 9 percent from its all-time highs. One technician says the dip has created an optimal buying opportunity.
 Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com, said the technology company's stock is in for a big that could take it into uncharted territory.
""If you look at the corrections over the last couple of years, they're about 20 to 27 percent,"" he said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""And as the chart shows, we moved right down into technical support about the $180, $181 low.""
 The technical support Gordon mentions is actually the bottom of a parallel channel, one whose top line suggests that Nvidia could actually bounce from that support level.
 ""You won't reach technical resistance until $250 in the topside of that railroad track,"" Gordon said. This means that Nvidia could actually surge another 30 percent from Friday's levels.
Shares of Nvidia were up fractionally Friday, trading at $192.80.
Nvidia is also looking strong on a fundamental basis, said Michael Bapis, managing director of The Bapis Group at Hightower Advisors. Based on the current demand and developments in the tech sector, chip stocks like Nvidia are yet to see their heyday, he said.
""We're in the second inning of a technology boom that I think is going to continue for a long time, and as long as semiconductors are needed to make technology work, we're long the sector,"" he said on ""Trading Nation.""
Bapis did mention Nvidia in particular as a strong performer whose earnings outlook is positive. ""If [chips] can continue to crush their earnings like they have in the past couple quarters, I think I'm long the sector for the foreseeable future,"" he added.
Despite the November sell-off, Nvidia is still up over 81 percent this year. Semiconductors as a group are up 37 percent this year.

 Cramer reviews the bear case for FANG stocks   
 6:39  PM ET Tue, 19 Dec 2017 |  00:57 
 After the decline in the FANG stocks on Tuesday, CNBC's Jim Cramer issued a warning to investors who own the technology-laden group.
 ""I just wanted to get in front of tomorrow's storyline,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""You better believe the obituary's being written once again right now, this time with the death notice containing two As and two Ns, as in FAANNG, or Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Nvidia and Google, the company now known as Alphabet.""
Weakness in the FAANNGs is bound to be taken seriously, which is why Cramer looked at the broader market layout, starting with the GOP-led tax overhaul.
 The sweeping tax cuts Republicans are chasing could put a trillion-dollar hole in the U.S. deficit. That would lead the government to borrow money, flooding the bond market with supply and driving interest rates higher.
But higher interest rates usually lead to higher inflation. Inflation erodes purchasing power, which in turn diminishes future earnings estimates.
""Given that the FAANNG stocks represent big bets on the future earnings of high-growth companies, ... inflation's real bad for them, so their stocks sell off when rates go up,"" Cramer said. ""Let me simplify it: higher rates often lead to lower prices for the most juiced stocks out there, and FAANNG be the king of the juice.""
To make sense of the noise (and explain why panic is fruitless), the ""Mad Money"" host went over each FAANNG stock's individual bear case.
 Facebook
 Word on Wall Street is that Facebook's next earnings report will be in line with estimates because the social media giant hasn't come up with a new, hot product in a while.
""It's become same-old, same-old — same-old, same-old great, I should add — and that's not enough for the market,"" Cramer said. ""I'm not kidding — that's really the rap against Facebook.""
 Amazon
 After Citi Research upgraded Walmart on Tuesday, saying that the retailer finally has enough online momentum to seriously compete with Amazon, the Amazon bears came running.
""I think Amazon is fabulous, especially its red-hot web services business,"" Cramer said, even as he agreed that Walmart is a formidable competitor. ""If we get any real weakness, I'll pound the table.""
 Apple
 Cramer has heard every bear case for Apple under the sun, including the latest downgrade that argued the tech stock's gains from the iPhone super-cycle are ""in the late innings.""
""Look, you may be tempted to sell it here and try to buy it back at lower levels,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""I think that's a fool's errand. I say own Apple, don't trade it. Every trading call to get out of Apple has been wrong. This piece did not change my mind.""
 Netflix
 In Cramer's opinion, Netflix's recent decline is all about Disney. Following the Disney-Fox deal, the bears are worried that Disney might build a competing streaming service.
""This is a tough one,"" Cramer admitted. ""I always think, though, what would it take to duplicate Netflix's business? I think certainly it would cost more than the company's current $80 billion valuation. That said, I will concede that it is definitely the most vulnerable of the FAANNGs.""
 Nvidia
 Nvidia's problem has consistently been that the semiconductor play has one of the most expensive stocks in the world.
But Cramer argued that the chipmaker dominates when it comes to gaming, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and the data center, even though its wares will certainly be challenged.
""Does that mean you should sell the stock? Look, Nvidia the stock has periodic swoons, and this one has lasted a long time, ever since the company reported,"" he said. ""I believe it's digesting a big move and this stock, like the other FAANNGs, is simply the victim of a rotation.""
 Alphabet
 The ""Mad Money"" host could hardly find a bear case for the parent company of Google.
""I think it's gaining market share and has about $100 billion in cash to fall back on,"" he said. ""Also, it [has] a swell web service business that's doing fantastically — not as good as Amazon, but still good — and an autonomous car business called Waymo that's second to none. Needless to say, I would not be a seller.""
 Final Thoughts
 In all his years in the business, Cramer has seen the FAANNG stocks pronounced dead plenty of times. But that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the underlying companies, he said.
""Don't let some analyst downgrade or some rotation out of high growth scare you away from owning some FAANNG,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Until I see a coroner's report from real competitors of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Nvidia and Alphabet, I think we need to presume that these stories remain very much alive.""

 Nvidia changed its chip restrictions, and some folks aren't happy   
 1:20  PM ET Thu, 28 Dec 2017 |  00:53 
 Nvidia is cracking down on unwanted use of some of its graphics cards.
 On Wednesday the company confirmed a key change to the licensing agreement for driver software that goes with its GeForce and Titan graphics processing units. The update, which was made when Nvidia introduced the Titan V GPU earlier this month, is intended to deter the use of those GPUs inside data centers.
The change does not apply to Nvidia's Tesla line of GPUs, which are available from cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. GPUs are a popular choice among artificial intelligence researchers and have driven the 85 percent surge in Nvidia's stock price this year.
 Discussion forums on Reddit in recent days have tried to make sense of the new language in the software end-user licensing agreement, which is posted on Nvidia's website. Some critical responses have alleged that Nvidia is making the change to compel customers to use the more expensive Tesla GPUs instead of lower-cost processors. The Titan V starts at $3,000, while the new Tesla V100 is available for $8,000. 
An Nvidia spokesperson, in an email to CNBC, highlighted several reasons that companies would prefer Tesla GPUs inside data centers. They include support and longer life expectancy. The email said that if customers want to use Titan or GeForce GPUs in data centers, they can talk with Nvidia's sales department. 
""We expect that, working together with our user base on a case-by-case basis, we will be able to resolve any customer concerns,"" the spokesperson wrote. Additionally, those who don't download new drivers won't be held to the new terms.
Here's Nvidia's full statement to CNBC: 
 GeForce and TITAN GPUs were never designed for data center deployments with the complex hardware, software, and thermal requirements for 24x7 operation, where there are often multi-stack racks. To clarify this, we recently added a provision to our GeForce-specific EULA to discourage potential misuse of our GeForce and TITAN products in demanding, large-scale enterprise environments. NVIDIA addresses the unique mechanical, physical, management, functional, reliability, and availability needs of servers with our Tesla products, which include a three-year warranty covering data center workloads, NVIDIA enterprise support, guaranteed continuity of supply and extended SKU life expectancy for data center components. This has been communicated to the market since the Tesla products were first released. We recognize that researchers often adapt GeForce and TITAN products for non-commercial uses or other research uses that do not operate at data center scale. NVIDIA does not intend to prohibit such uses.

Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang attends an event during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan May 30, 2017.
 AMD and Nvidia will benefit from Intel's chip security vulnerability and related performance issues, according to one Wall Street firm.British tech website The Register reported Tuesday that some Intel processors have a ""fundamental design flaw"" and security vulnerability, which spurred the company to confirm the exploit later in the day. Shares of AMD and Nvidia rose 5.2 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively, Wednesday, while Intel's stock declined 3.4 percent. 
 Mizuho Securities told its clients Wednesday Intel's chip security issue will be used by its competitors.
""Near-term, given some of the vulnerabilities on INTC processors, we believe AMD and NVDA could use it has a marketing edge given differing architectures and no vulnerability yet,"" analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote. ""It could be a tailwind for AMD and NVDA which are not seeing similar issues because of a different architecture implementation.""
 AMD rose 6 percent and Nvidia rallied 1.5 percent, respectively, Thursday following the report, while Intel fell 4 percent.
Rakesh said Intel has 99 percent share in the data center processor market and roughly 80 percent share in the PC chip market. He downplayed Intel's assertion that the security issue will not have a big impact on its business as ""optimistic.""
The analyst noted in some special instances the impeding security patches for Intel chips could cause a decrease in performance of 20 to 30 percent.
""While INTC does not see a financial or market share impact from the security issue and performance degradation with the vulnerability, we believe its high performance customers might have a different take,"" he wrote. This is ""a leg up for AMD and Nvidia. A difference in architecture implies less vulnerability as noted by AMD 'with near zero risk' and we believe [the same] for NVDA.""
Rakesh maintained his buy ratings on AMD, Nvidia and Intel.

Nvidia founder, President and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang
 Nvidia's gaming business will drive further gains for the company's shares this year, according to a top Wall Street firm.
 Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating for Nvidia shares, predicting the chipmaker will report earnings ahead of expectations.
""Nvidia is one of the few stocks in our coverage universe exposed to multiple secular growth markets … With the emergence of eSports and the potential proliferation of VR/AR, we view Gaming as a meaningful and sustainable growth driver for the overall company,"" analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""In terms of single stock, our top picks in Semis and Semi Cap are Nvidia and Entegris.""
 Hari reaffirmed his $228 12-month price target for Nvidia shares, representing 7 percent upside to Thursday's close.
Nvidia is up 109 percent over the last 12 months, the best return of any chip stock in the S&P 500 and the third-best change of any stock in the benchmark.
The analyst predicts Nvidia will launch new Volta chip-based graphics cards in its second or third fiscal quarter later this year. As a result, he forecasts fiscal 2019 earnings per share of $6 for the chipmaker versus the $4.53 Wall Street consensus.
""Nvidia's first-mover advantage coupled with the sheer size of the market will lead to positive EPS revisions,"" he wrote.
In another move, Hari raised his rating for Xilinx shares to buy from neutral due to strength in the communications and cloud computing data center markets.

An Uber driverless Ford Fusion drives down Smallman Street on September, 22, 2016 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
 Nvidia has partnered with Uber, Volkswagen and China's Baidu in driverless cars, as the chipmaker looks to expand its presence in the autonomous driving space. 
 Ride-hailing service Uber will use Nvidia's chips for its artificial intelligence (AI) computing system in its fleet of self-driving cars, the companies said at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on Sunday. 
Nvidia makes graphics computing chips which are key components of the autonomous cars setup. 
 Its stock was up s percent in morning trading. 
Uber began working with self-driving technology in 2015 and has since launched trials in Pittsburgh, PA, and Phoenix, Arizona. The company says its driverless cars have completed more than 50,000 passenger trips and have logged over 2 million autonomous miles.
Nvidia's graphics computing technology was used in the first test fleet of Volvo XC90 SUVs that Uber was using. Uber is also using the technology in its current fleet of self-driving cars and freight trucks. 
At CES, Nvidia also announced a partnership with Volkswagen. The German carmaker will use the Nvidia Drive IX platform to help develop its next set of cars.
Nvidia Drive IX allows automakers to put features in the car such as facial recognition to unlock the vehicle, gesture controls, and a voice assistant similar to Amazon's Alexa for example.
Volkswagen said it will use the software to create an ""intelligent co-pilot"" to assist a driver. This will be in Volkswagen's concept I.D. Buzz vehicle, a retro-styled microbus. 
On Sunday, Nvidia also announced plans to create a production-ready AI autonomous vehicle system designed for China, in collaboration with Chinese internet giant Baidu and German car parts maker ZF. 
It's based on the Nvidia Drive Xavier platform, a chip and software system that allows fully autonomous driving. Xavier was teased last year. But the Baidu announcement is the first real commercial application. 
The driverless car system created by the three companies will use Xavier from Nvidia, sensors and cameras from ZF, and Baidu's autonomous software system called Apollo Pilot.

 Nvidia shares will surge again this year due to a strong upgrade cycle in its gaming graphics chip business, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
 BofAML raised its price target for the chipmaker to the highest among the firms covering Nvidia, citing the company's product leadership in multiple growth areas in technology.
Nvidia has been one of the best performing stocks in the market during the past year. Its shares are up 113 percent in the previous 12 months compared with the S&P 500's 24 percent return.
 The company's shares were up 1.6 percent in Friday morning trading.
While Nvidia ""trades at a premium valuation, we believe this is justified by Nvidia's leadership in the largest and fastest growing markets in semis including [artificial intelligence], gaming, [virtual reality], and autonomous cars,"" analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients Thursday. Arya said there's a ""large upgrade opportunity for Nvidia cards.""
Arya reiterated his buy and top-pick ratings for Nvidia shares. He raised his price target to $275 from $251, representing 23 percent upside from Thursday's close. He now has the highest price target on the stock out of 29 analysts, according to FactSet.
The analyst said the company's current generation ""Pascal"" gaming graphics cards have 40 percent share of Nvidia card owners on PC gaming distribution platform Steam. He said there is still ""a large upgrade potential"" from the previous Nvidia ""Maxwell"" cards, which are at 48 percent share.
""Separately, Nintendo Switch console [with its approximately $40 Nvidia processor] became the best-selling console of all time in the US during its first 10 months on the market,"" he wrote. ""Lastly, we expect Nvidia to start rolling out its next-gen Volta cards in likely just the premium segment, during 2H18, which could create further upgrade and [advance simulation products] tailwinds.""

 Trader bets on a bounce for Nvidia   
 5:20  PM ET Thu, 18 Jan 2018 |  03:08 
 Nvidia has already surged more than 15 percent in the new year, and one trader is betting that the chipmaker has even more room to run.
 While chip stocks have been on a tear, TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon has his eye on Nvidia in particular thanks to what he believes is a strong performance pattern for the stock.
""I like the technical setup of Nvidia,"" he said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""You can see that we are well-contained in a parallel trend channel that originated in December and carried through to 2018.""
 Additionally, Gordon sees support for Nvidia at around the $217 level after a breakout, which used to be a resistance point from which Nvidia fell back in November. This breakout leads him to believe that should the stock dip, it could still bounce from the $217 level.
 In advance of Nvidia's earnings report on Feb. 8, Gordon wants to sell the February monthly 220-strike put and pair that with the purchase of the February monthly 215-strike put. This would allow Gordon to collect a credit of $2.08, or $208, should Nvidia close above $220 on the Feb. 16 expiration.
But if Nvidia closes below $215 on expiration, then Gordon could lose $285. While Nvidia was trading at $224 on Wednesday, the trader wants to establish a point at which to step out.
""If the support at about $217 is broken, the reason for being in this trade is wrong,"" he said.
Nvidia has soared 118 percent in the past year.

Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy in an interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt at the 2017 AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas.
 Networking with health-care venture capitalists is now a full-time job.
 Amazon Web Services and Nvidia have job openings for folks who can network with health investors from the elite firms.
In Nvidia's case, that means funds like Venrock, which it specifically mentions. The AWS listing doesn't name-check any firms in its job listing, in favor of letting its future hire identify ""appropriate VCs to target."" 
 The idea behind these hires seems to be to build up relationships with investors and their portfolio companies, so they make an early decision to buy AI chips and services from Nvidia or AWS over others. Switching costs at a later stage in the companies' life cycle are labor-intensive and expensive. 
The idea isn't new: Big tech companies have been networking with VC firms and start-up accelerator programs for years. 
But the health-care angle is interesting because traditional tech firms haven't typically paid much attention to health.
""What's different today is that they (tech) recognize that health care is roughly a fifth of the GDP and they need a specific strategy to grow quickly in this sector,"" said Venkat Mocherla, who runs business development at Qventus, a health start-up that uses artificial intelligence tools to speed up hospital operations. 
 A.I. is hot
 Bringing AI tools to health care is a particularly hot area.
Nvidia's strategic business development lead for health care would work from the company's AI start-up program, which it describes as cultivating ""dedicated and extraordinary start-ups who are revolutionizing industries."" It's looking for a health-care expert with a strong grasp of the inner workings of pharma and health information systems.
Genomics companies are rich targets for big tech beause they generate a massive amount of data. For that reason, Alphabet has a team called Google Genomics dedicated to the space, and Amazon made a strategic investment in Grail, a company that mines genetic information for early signs of cancer.
Venrock health investor Bob Kocher said by phone that he is not shocked that companies are looking to network with his team. 
""It is certainly true that many large companies reach out to us to work with our portfolio companies and let us know why we should be early adopters,"" he said. Venrock has backed health companies ranging from Castlight to Juno Therapeutics.
Kocher said companies like Apple, Alphabet and Amazon are realizing that these companies have strong growth potential and are on the market for new technology tools.
""Health care is a data-intensive business,"" he said.
He also has some advice for applicants to these jobs.
""I like two pumps of vanilla in my latte,"" he joked.

Nvidia founder, President and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang
 AMD's and Nvidia's core gaming customers deserve better.
 PC enthusiasts are suffering as digital currency miners drive up graphics card prices and cause big shortages again. The two chipmakers must do more to protect the needs of their most important market or risk building their businesses on cryptocurrency quick sand.
Digital currency miners use graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia to ""mine"" new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation. Bank of America Merrill Lynch said ethereum is currently one of the popular alternative coins to mine with PC graphics cards.
 ""We single out ethereum as the overwhelming driving force for GPU demand given its larger size (market cap) and higher mind share relative to other coins,"" analyst Vivek Arya wrote in a note to clients Thursday.
The price of ethereum cryptocurrency spiked more than 400 percent in the second quarter of 2017, resulting is card shortages during the summer. The digital currency then more than doubled during the last two months last year. It is now up over 8,800 percent over the past 12 months, according to data from industry website CoinMarketCap.

Every time cryptocurrency prices have surged higher, it has increased digital currency mining demand for AMD and Nvidia graphics cards.
Computer hardware retailers including Newegg, Best Buy and Amazon are sold out of most AMD RX 570/RX 580 and Nvidia GTX 1070/1080 graphics card models as of midday Monday.

When cards do become available, they are often priced by third-party sellers at more than double or even triple Nvidia's and AMD's suggested list prices.

The PC gaming community is flooding social media and Reddit with thousands of angry posts, over the price gouging.
 Tweet Link
 One industry veteran lamented over the ramifications of consumers not being able to upgrade their gaming PC rigs.
""With availability consumed by the cryptocurrency mining market, there is little chance for any PC gamer to find a graphics card in stock, let along close to the expected price point,"" Shrout Research's Ryan Shrout wrote in an email. ""Because of that, many enthusiasts and DIY builders are putting off system builds and upgrades completely, setting up an unfortunate situation for all other component vendors from processors to motherboards to storage.""
Cryptocurrency miner demand is not sustainable or predictable over the long term. These buyers tend to flee as soon as profitability wanes as they do not have any brand loyalty and only care about mining return on investment.
This isn't the first time the digital currency craze has led to dramatic graphic card shortages. It occurred in June of last year and during the bitcoin boom of 2013.
AMD and Nvidia should not take the PC gaming market for granted. Gamers may resort to buying more powerful consoles such as the recently released Xbox One X, simply give up in frustration and move to other entertainment alternatives. 
The companies can't risk losing these customers in exchange for short-term oriented, fickle digital currency miners.Perhaps AMD and Nvidia can work with their retailer partners and limit sales to one or two cards per household. The companies can also incorporate better mining features for their cryptocurrency-specific mining cards or even take the drastic step of altering gaming graphics card firmware to limit mining functionality.
Something must be done.
Nvidia declined to comment for this story.
AMD sent the following statement when asked about the graphics card shortages for PC gamers due to the cryptocurrency mining:
 ""The gaming market remains a priority for AMD and gamers are a primary focus across our GPUs, CPUs and semi-custom game console products.""

 Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Nvidia shares, but removed the chipmaker from its ""conviction list,"" citing concerns over its digital currency business.
""While we continue to see meaningful upside to FY2019/2020 estimates and maintain our Buy rating, we believe a) the long-term secular growth angle in Datacenter is now better-understood, and near-term dynamics in Cryptocurrency demand may lead to increased earnings volatility,"" analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.
 Nvidia shares are down 2 percent on Thursday.
Hari raised his 12-month price target to $281 from $228 for Nvidia shares, representing 14 percent upside to Wednesday's close.
The analyst noted graphics chip competitor AMD said 5 to 6 percent of its 2017 sales or $300 million came from cryptocurrency miners. The price of ethereum, a popular digital currency mined by using AMD and Nvidia cards, more than doubled during the final two months of last year. It is now up more than 10,000 percent over the past 12 months, according to data from industry website Coinbase.
""While the increase in GPU demand from Ether miners is boosting fundamentals in the near-term, increased exposure to the Crypto market will, in our view, increase uncertainty and volatility, which are typically dilutive to valuation multiples,"" he wrote.
Nvidia is up 116 percent over the last 12 months, the best return of any chip stock in the S&P 500 and the fourth-best change of any name in the benchmark.

 Cramer: Boeing, Nvidia, Mastercard, Idexx all headed higher in 2018   
 6:36  PM ET Thu,  1 Feb 2018 |  01:16 
 In looking at the overall market layout, CNBC's Jim Cramer has determined that some stocks are simply ""on a mission"" to greatness.
 ""These are the stocks that blast out of orbit, and that orbit may have had them stuck for ages. And once they are in motion, they stay in motion until they get to where they need to go,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""You either get long or you get out of their way.""
 1. Boeing
 Cramer has found few stocks that are on as determined a mission as Boeing, the massive aircraft manufacturer that took the No. 1 spot in the Dow Jones industrial average for 2017.
 ""This stock has been going up pretty much in a straight line ever since we had the CEO, Dennis Muilenburg, on the show in December when he confirmed that business is stronger,"" Cramer said.
Fueled by an $18 billion share buyback, a 20 percent dividend boost and an upbeat earnings report, shares of Boeing have been soaring, closing Thursday's trading session at $356.94 a share.
""I think the stock of Boeing ... is headed for $400, where it might run out of steam, but only because it'll become the most expensive stock in the Dow,"" the ""Mad Money"" host predicted.
 2. Mastercard
 Cramer thinks that Mastercard's stock, $172.93 a share at Thursday's close, is on a mission to $200.
Thanks to the global shift in payments from paper to plastic, shares of Mastercard have been on a tear, up nearly 15 percent just since the start of 2018.
""Mastercard reported yet another blowout quarter, which is amazing when you consider how the bar's been raised so high after all these upside surprises,"" Cramer said. ""This time, though, the company had a whole new angle: cryptocurrencies.""
In its Thursday earnings report, Mastercard acknowledged that its customers were buying digital currencies such as bitcoin using their credit cards and said it would develop a prepaid card for companies involved in cryptocurrencies.
""That's like throwing gasoline on the fire that's been raging under Mastercard's stock,"" Cramer said.
 3. Idexx Laboratories
 Shares of Idexx Laboratories, a large veterinary care provider, have ""been making a beeline to $200 and maybe beyond"" since the start of 2018, Cramer said.
One of Cramer's favorite ""humanization of pets"" plays, Idexx beat Wall Street's earnings estimates in its Thursday morning report. Shares of Idexx closed at $194.06 on Thursday.
""Room to run,"" the ""Mad Money"" host quipped.
 4. Nvidia
 Finally, Cramer addressed the juggernaut that is the stock of Nvidia, a $240 stock that he said is on a path to $300.
Shares of the chipmaker — a key player in trends like video gaming, machine learning, artificial intelligence and the internet of things — have gone up far enough to raise concerns among some on the Street, including Cramer.
On Thursday, Goldman Sachs downgraded Nvidia's stock to ""buy"" from ""conviction buy,"" citing volatility in the company's cryptocurrency mining business.
Cramer admitted that he, too, has told club members of his charitable trust to trim their Nvidia positions because it is ""simply up too much.""
 Final thoughts
 ""The most incredible thing about stocks that are on a mission? Once they get started, they rarely fizzle out that quickly. They are objects in motion that stay in motion. It's like a law of physics. These companies are all on jet-propelled paths higher, although they do give you nice buying opportunities whenever they stop to refuel,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Otherwise, look out above and get out of the way. These stocks are going to where they have to go.""

 After astronomical climb of nearly 900% in two years, Nvidia is due for a correction: Analyst   
 5:07  PM ET Thu,  1 Feb 2018 |  01:33 
 Nvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks in recent years, soaring triple digits in the last 12 months alone.  However, a breather is long overdue.  Consider these astronomical gains as the company is set to report quarterly earnings next week. After an 850 percent rally from its February 2016 lows and a 1,150 percent in the last three years, long-term investors may want to consider taking some small profits in the stock.
 Reminiscent of the dot-com bubble?
 The stock's rally has been so strong over such a short period of time that it is now trading at a premium of more than 250 percent to its 200-day moving average; this is extreme, and reminiscent of what we saw for several tech stocks near the top of the tech bubble. Remember, Apple had a near-identical premium at the market top in 2000.
 Indeed, it is difficult to time the market. Still, there is a difference between attempting to ""time the market"" and ""managing your investments in a responsible way.""
 Positioning your portfolio
 We can think of Nvidia's rise in another way. If you bought Nvidia two years ago, you can sell just 11 percent of your investment and get back 100 percent of what you put into the stock, but you'll still be able to take advantage of almost 90 percent of any further upside movement!  Investors do not have to sell all at once, particularly when they have fabulous gains.  They don't have to try to wring every last penny of profit out of the investment; peeling off small amounts after moves like these is simply a prudent way to manage one's investments properly ... and feel a lot better when the stock sees an inevitable correction.

 Semi stocks get slammed   
 4:56  PM ET Mon,  5 Feb 2018 |  03:14 
 Nvidia shares surged Tuesday, after a three-day sell-off pushed the stock into a correction.
Even that steep decline has not made its valuation reasonable yet, says Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak.
 Nvidia stock surged 490 percent over 2016 and 2017. That was nearly 10 times more than the XLK Technology ETF's gain over the same period. In January, its shares rocketed 27 percent higher in its best monthly gain since May.
""It was ridiculously overbought,"" Maley told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Monday. ""I think the stock has to come back a little bit more. Even if it pulled back 20 percent, that's still nothing.""
Nvidia shares entered a correction on Monday after selling off alongside broader markets. At its lowest during Monday's session, the stock was nearly 18 percent from its 52-week high set on Jan. 31. It is still 11 percent lower than all-time highs even as it spends Tuesday in a rebound.
Even after the sell-off, Nvidia has a price-to-earnings ratio of 45.7 times forward earnings, far from the XLK's 17 times forward earnings and the SMH Semiconductor ETF's 15 times forward earnings. Nvidia has one of the highest PE ratios in the chips space, bypassing Advanced Micro Devices, Texas Instruments and Micron Technology. It is the sixth largest U.S. semiconductor company by sales.
Its stock needs to see a little bit more pain until Maley could see it as a buy. He sees a return to its 100-day moving average at around $204 a share as a good entry point to the stock on a technical basis. Its shares are currently around 7 percent higher than those levels.
Before Friday kicked off the sell-off, the semiconductor sector as a whole had seen a multiyear rally on high demand in smartphones and a surge in cryptocurrency mining and trading. But, that demand has created an inflated sense of the industry's stock value, says Michael Bapis, managing director at The Bapis Group at HighTower Advisors.
""They've artificially benefited from great sales in iPhones, from great sales in other products, and from this whole blockchain technology that everybody is talking about,"" Bapis told ""Trading Nation."" ""If they are going to benefit from that in the future, that's what remains to be seen.""
The group rallied more than 30 percent in both 2016 and 2017 in their best back-to-back gains since 2010. Gains in semiconductors have outpaced broader markets since the U.S. election. While the SMH ETF added 43 percent since November 2016, the S&P 500 increased roughly half that at 23 percent.
""At this point, we think it's pretty richly priced as a sector,"" added Bapis.
Over Friday's and Monday's sessions, the SMH semiconductor ETF lost a combined 7 percent, slightly deeper than the drop on the S&P 500. The ETF tumbled Monday in its worst daily performance since December 2016.

 Cramer Remix: How to play Nvidia in a volatile market   
 7:41  PM ET Thu,  8 Feb 2018 |  01:12 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer is confident that he's pinpointed the real cause of the market-wide sell-off that has weighed on stocks for much of the week.
 The pain dragged the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 1,000 points on Thursday, with the index closing near correction levels, down 1,032.89 points.
""The real culprit behind today's decline is the same miscreant that's weighed us down for the last couple of days: the unspooling of these obscure products that allowed ... idiotic money managers and neophyte investors to bet against what's known as volatility,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
 Very few stocks can withstand hedge-fun-led pain like this, Cramer warned. Big dividends don't help because the market is declining all at once, valuation is no defense because stocks can always go lower and stock buybacks only help ""sop up"" the shares being sold, he said.
The only stocks that really work are ones that are able to deliver drastic surprises to the upside, like Twitter after its Wednesday earnings report or GrubHub and Nvidia after their Thursday reports.
""Nvidia reported after the close and it was down hard all day today because of this nonsense I'm describing. But this stock managed to rally in the after-market because the quarter was that fantastic,"" Cramer said. ""If we get a huge down opening tomorrow, which is certainly likely because of what I described, and Nvidia, the stock, goes lower, it might be worth buying. But if it's up big, though, you stay away. It will most likely be pulled down. Don't chase a thing in this market. That's a fool's errand.""
 The 4 culprits behind the sell-off

Traders signal offers in the VIX pit at the Cboe Global Markets exchange.
 Many market-watchers have been wondering what caused this week's rapid-fire sell-off, so Cramer decided to oust the ""real culprits"" behind the nosedive.
""There are four instruments ... that I am watching to figure out when this portion of stock market nightmare is over,"" he said. ""They're all a mouthful, but you know what? I owe you the whole truth and nothing but the truth, even if you actually need a rocket scientist to figure some of this out.""
Cramer began by explaining the idea behind the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, colloquially known as the market's ""fear gauge.""
Volatility, most commonly tracked by the VIX, refers to the amount of uncertainty in the size and direction of changes in the stock market. It is typically measured by the deviation of returns.
For much of 2017, the VIX remained at extremely low levels. Its placid nature piqued Wall Street's interest, leading to the rise of leveraged trading vehicles like the XIV, the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term exchange-traded note, as ways to short the low-volatility layout.
""Now, it isn't enough sometimes on Wall Street to just own volatility or bet against volatility,"" Cramer said. ""Brokerages know people crave real juice, particularly hedge fund managers, so they invented stocks that allowed you to get twice the gain of the VIX on a given day, or get twice the loss of the VIX if it goes down on a given day,"" Cramer said.
""These instruments are the proximate cause of the madness you are now seeing,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said, pointing to four specific funds exacerbating the pain.
 What's driving the pain?

 With markets reeling, one theory that has surfaced to explain the sell-off is that it was driven by the bond market. But Cramer isn't convinced.
""That's just one theory,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Let's say it's the earnings that were driving the rally. Then I could argue stocks as an asset class aren't that overvalued, so you can buy the weakness, especially because the whole market has already become a heck of a lot cheaper in the last few days.""
The problem is that the inverse volatility trading products that Cramer has been railing against are clouding the real reason for the sell-off, making it difficult for him and others to discern whether bonds or earnings are to blame.
""Look at like this: we know we're taking enemy fire, but we won't know where it's coming from until the VIX-related smoke clears,"" Cramer said.
 Cramer's sell-off strategies

 In a strategy session with callers from Cramerica, the ""Mad Money"" host helped them figure out how to play the market's downturn.
To a caller who wanted to buy a leading sector into the decline, Cramer instantly recommended FANG — with one exception.
""The reason why you're going to buy FANG is because those are classic what we call long-dated assets,"" Cramer said. ""What matters is you have to buy stocks that have a long-term vision with a CEO who has a great vision that are not necessarily susceptible to the economy. And, yes, that's Facebook, that is Amazon, that is Netflix. I am not going to recommend Google here. I would rather see you be in Adobe.""
 WestRock: A packaged goodie?
 Finally, Cramer vetted the first major acquisition of 2018: packaging product maker WestRock's $4.9 billion purchase of KapStone.
""In short, this KapStone acquisition is, objectively, a fantastic thing for WestRock,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Not only will the integration of KapStone be immediately additive to the new WestRock's earnings, but the company is guiding towards $200 million in cost synergies and performance improvements, Cramer said.
Plus, commodity plays like this paper giant tend to benefit during global economic expansions, and despite the slumping stock market, the United States is mid-economic recovery, he said.
""The truth is, the world hasn't stopped just because the stock market's getting slammed. … Life goes on, and all of this chaos may be causing you to miss out on an opportunity in the packaging space, the sector that's always been the place to be at this stage of the economic expansion,"" Cramer concluded. ""WestRock makes sense on the KapStone deal, as does the long-time friend of the show, International Paper. Just be careful to scale into them slowly … but you will have the wind at your back the moment this violent volatility spell is over, and I don't want you to have bought nothing into the downturn.""
 Lightning round: Down day buys
 In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
Silicon Laboratories: ""That's not the place. I think you can go out and buy an Intel on a day like today, or buy Nvidia if it's down tomorrow.""
Switch: ""We've got so many fabulous stocks that are down so much. I'd rather have you think long-term and buy VMware.""

 Nvidia gives strong Q1 revenues guidance   
 6:27  PM ET Thu,  8 Feb 2018 |  00:35 
 Nvidia shares jumped more than 14 percent Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter. After the earnings call ended the stock was more than 9 percent higher than the closing price of $217.52 per share.
 The after-market rally more than made up for Nvidia's 4.9 percent drop in regular trading, as the broad market swoon brought down 97 percent of stocks in the S&P 500.
 Earnings: $1.78 per share, vs. $1.17 per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.    Revenue: $2.91 billion, vs. $2.69 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. 
 Revenue for the quarter jumped 34 percent from a year earlier, and Nvidia's revenue of the full fiscal year of $9.71 billion was up 41 percent, according to a statement.
Nvidia exceeded analysts' expectations in four of its five markets. The biggest category, gaming, produced $1.74 billion in revenue, above the FactSet estimate of $1.54 billion, according to StreetAccount. The second largest area, data center, came up with $606 million in revenue, above the consensus estimate of $552.1 million.
Cryptocurrency demand contributed to sales growth for Nvidia's Pascal-generation graphics processing units for gaming, the company said, and it was indeed above Nvidia's expectations, CFO Colette Kress said on a conference call with analysts after the earnings release.
Kress said sales of the Nintendo Switch gaming console contributed to Nvidia's growth in the quarter. Nvidia's Tegra processor revenue, which totaled $450 million, was up 75 percent year over year. 
Nvidia said it's expecting $2.9 billion in revenue, plus or minus 2 percent, for the first quarter of its 2019 fiscal year. Analysts were expecting guidance of $2.46 billion in revenue for the quarter.
Nvidia said it had a benefit of $133 million in the quarter as a result of recently enacted U.S. tax reform. The company expects to have a tax rate of 12 percent, plus or minus 1 percentage point, for the quarter. That's down from around 17 percent previously, Kress said.
In the fourth quarter, Nvidia introduced the Titan V graphics processing unit for desktop PCs, and it also changed the licensing terms for some of its GPUs.
Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the result of the tax change. Nvidia recorded a benefit tied to tax reform.

 Expedia stock plummeted over 18 percent in extended trading. The travel company's financials fell below expectations on top and bottom lines, with revenue just missing Wall Street predictions and earnings per share missed by a margin of 31 cents.
It reported an increase in bookings that was slightly higher than anticipated, but the intense competition and other difficulties of the online travel industry made it difficult for Expedia to succeed.
 FireEye shares jumped more than 13 percent after the bell. The cybersecurity software firm reported financials that surpassed Wall Street expectations on top and bottom lines. Earnings surprised analysts with EPS of 1 cent, as opposed to predictions of a loss. Revenue is up 10% year-over-year. Growth in every product group and region.

Cryptocurrency demand contributed to sales growth for Nvidia's Pascal-generation graphics processing units for gaming.
Woodward stock plunged more than 9 percent in the extended session. Boeing was rumored to be in talks with Woodward earlier on Thursday about buying the aircraft parts manufacturer, but Woodward declared that the two are not in talks.
Activision Blizzard stock rose nearly 2 percent after the bell. The interactive entertainment company called this quarter a ""record quarter to cap off a record year."" Financials surpassed Wall Street expectations on top and bottom lines and showed very strong guidance for the upcoming year.
Skechers shares climbed over 4 percent in extended trading. The footwear company announced record full-year 2017 sales and a 52.6 percent increase in total international wholesale and retail sales. Earnings and revenue both surpassed analysts' predictions.

Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, shows the Drive Pegasus robotaxi AI computer at his keynote address at CES in Las Vegas, January 7, 2018.
 Nvidia shares rose as Wall Street is growing more optimistic on the company's opportunities in key growth markets.
 The chipmaker reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and guidance Thursday. Nvidia's biggest business segment, gaming, produced $1.74 billion in revenue, above the FactSet estimate of $1.54 billion. The second largest area, data center, came up with $606 million in revenue, above the consensus estimate of $552.1 million.
Nvidia shares rallied 6.7 percent Friday. The stock rose despite a troubling overall market environment right now that saw the Dow Jones industrial average drop more the 1,000 points twice this week.
 ""We reiterate our outperform rating on NVIDIA and are raising our price target … following yet another exceptionally strong quarter and guidance,"" Raymond James analyst Chris Caso wrote in a note to clients Thursday entitled ""NVIDIA Does It Again - Another Amazing Beat/Raise."" ""The stock's valuation is of course high, but as long as the company keeps putting up quarters like this, and with future potential catalysts from Auto and inferencing ahead, we believe shares will continue to move higher.""
Caso raised his price target on Nvidia shares to $275 from $250, representing 26 percent upside to Thursday's close.
Nvidia shares are significantly outperforming the market. The stock is up 87 percent in the past 12 months through Thursday compared with the S&P 500's 12 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 3 in the entire S&P 500.
One Wall Street firm is stunned over Nvidia's strong guidance for the next quarter.
RBC Capital Markets reiterated its outperform rating on the company's shares, citing optimism over its data center business.
""Overall, all of the necessary items were 'meet or exceed' with the most impressive part being the guidance suggesting another material quarter of Data Center growth,"" analyst Mitch Steves wrote in a note to clients Thursday. The company had ""a blow out quarter and guidance well ahead of expectations [and] marches EPS towards $2.00+ EPS run-rate a quarter earlier.""
Steves increased his price target to $280 from $250 for Nvidia shares.
KeyBanc Capital Markets pointed to the strength in the cryptocurrency mining market as a big driver of Nvidia's performance.
Digital currency miners use graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia to ""mine"" new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation.
""Strong GPU [graphics processing unit] demand from the cryptocurrency mining market has rapidly depleted excess channel inventory and buoyed strong sales, which offsets our prior concerns on gaming segment growth,"" analyst Michael McConnell wrote in a note to clients Thursday.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.
