 Celgene CEO: Precision medicine targeting metabolic drivers of disease   
 9:01  AM ET Thu,  3 Aug 2017 |  02:56 
 A decade ago, receiving a medicine designed for your specific genetic makeup or modifying your own immune cells to fight cancer may have seemed like something out of a science fiction novel. But today, ""precision"" medicines — tailored therapeutics based on a patient's distinct genetic characteristics — are turning fiction into fact for many patients.
 Since every person is unique, not only do precision medicines have the potential to bring highly effective therapies and high-value care to patients, they can also lower the overall cost of treating many of the most serious diseases. The investments needed to discover and develop these medicines can substantially improve health outcomes, and reduce the cost of failing to appropriately target treatment, estimated to be tens of billions of dollars every year.
Tailoring medical treatment to the profile of each patient can enable physicians to identify the best course of treatment and often avoid or reduce adverse drug reactions and the toxic effects of medicines that may not be necessary.
 ""[P]recision medicines are dramatically changing the treatment landscape for deadly cancers like non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma, not only increasing survival rates but also reducing the need for the costly procedures and hospitalizations.""
 For instance, according to a recent study published by  JAMA Oncology, genetic profiling can predict which women with early-stage breast cancer have a lower risk for their cancer coming back after surgery, allowing up to 15 percent of patients to avoid unnecessary chemotherapy.
Most importantly, precision medicines can help patients live longer, healthier lives. Already, the first wave of precision medicines have entered mainstream clinical practice, including targeted therapies that now make it possible for patients with a once incurable form of leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, to live close-to-normal life spans. Similarly, precision medicines are dramatically changing the treatment landscape for deadly cancers like non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma, not only increasing survival rates but also reducing the need for the costly procedures and hospitalizations that are now part of the standard of care for these diseases.
As a case study, consider acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one of the most serious and challenging blood cancers. Progress understanding and developing effective and safe therapy for patients with AML has been modest, and overall survival for patients with this terrible disease is measured in months. According to a study published by the journal, Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, the average cost for the chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation involved in treating many patients with AML has been estimated to be between $280,000 and $500,000. Discovering why this disease occurs and developing targeted medicines to treat it are really the only alternatives to help these patients and to reduce the cost of treatment failures.
Yet, to realize the promise of precision medicines, we must act collectively across the health-care ecosystem to ensure that patients who desperately need these transformational therapies have access to them.

 Celgene CEO: Time to think about health care in a different way   
 8:44  AM ET Thu,  3 Aug 2017 |  02:22 
 A problem that too many Americans face when prescribed specialty medicines to treat complex or rare conditions is high out-of-pocket costs. Many patients with the most serious illnesses face high deductibles and coinsurance requirements, which often put the latest, safest and most-effective treatments out of their reach. These patient cost-sharing barriers are one of the reasons half of the medicines used to treat chronic diseases are not taken as prescribed, contributing to the estimated $100 billion to $290 billion of unnecessary costs to the U.S. health-care system from medication non-adherence, as cited by the  Annals of Internal Medicine and the New England Journal of Medicine.
We must do better. We need to work together to ensure access to these medicines and reduce the financial burden on patients. Towards this end, Celgene is proactively working with major commercial U.S. health-care payers on arrangements designed to give eligible patients access to our most recently approved medicine — a precision therapy with an accompanying diagnostic test — without deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance. By partnering with payers to offset and even eliminate patient cost-sharing as an obstacle to treatment, our hope is to prevent some of the financial burden that leads to many of the problems currently impacting patient care.
Our action is just one step in what will be needed to ensure access to the medicines Americans grappling with devastating diseases need. As health-care stakeholders, it is up to all of us to work together to develop market-based solutions to ensure that medical innovation continues to be valued, and that patients have affordable health care. We're not there yet, but we are getting closer. Celgene is working with U.S. commercial health-care payers to step up to that challenge. We are also committed to engaging with policy-makers on finding ways to develop innovative contracting strategies that can benefit patients with government insurance as well. We encourage others in the health-care ecosystem to join us in finding solutions to these challenges.

 Cramer Remix: Don’t ignore the oldest rule in the game when it comes to Celgene   
 9:55  AM ET Mon,  9 Oct 2017 |  01:14 
 As news emerges of Amazon considering a big push into pharmaceuticals, CNBC's Jim Cramer endorsed one of his favorite drugmakers, Celgene, after its stock fell off a cliff on Thursday. 
 ""We like to buy low and sell high. It's literally the oldest rule in the game,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said as investors' flight from the stock subsided on Friday. ""So I consider it my job to point out when we're getting a nice buying opportunity in the stock of a high-quality company if they ever occur.""
Cramer said the market should view the pullback as ""a gift"" because every time Celgene shares have sold off, they've managed to rebound.
 The main driver for Celgene's drop was Morgan Stanley's downgrade of the stock to an ""underperform"" rating. Analysts' chief concerns were competition from generic versions of Celgene's flagship drugs and the biopharmaceutical player's 2018 pipeline.
But Cramer said Morgan Stanley blew its worries out of proportion. Celgene's patents likely won't be challenged by its rivals anytime soon — its three main patents expire in the 2020s, by which point the company will have made a considerable amount of money on the drugs.
And according to Celgene, its pipeline stands to generate up to $14 billion in peak sales. Moreover, successful clinical trials could send the stock surging once again, Cramer said.
""When a high-quality stock like Celgene gets slammed but the underlying thesis is still intact, I think you need to do some buying,"" Cramer concluded. ""Celgene's building a stable of multi-billion-dollar drugs, it's got fabulous management, and [blood cancer treatment] Revlimid's patent protection will likely hold up, so don't let this Morgan Stanley analyst scare you out of a good story, especially when that analyst sat out the whole run with a hold on the stock, which is not what I'd call value-added.""
 Cramer's Game Plan: Know What You Own
 Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images
 Stocks may have pulled back after weak nonfarm payroll numbers, but Cramer still noticed a somewhat dangerous rush into high-growth technology and cloud stocks.
""Does this make any sense? You know what, I don't even know anymore. Here's all I ask. The highest valued stocks are now making the big moves — 'highest valued' meaning the highest price-to-earnings, highest price-to-sales [multiples] — so I'm begging you to do something for me: if you're going to own these stocks ... please know what you're buying,"" Cramer said.
Cramer pointed to an indicator that could mean trouble for the seemingly unstoppable market. The S&P 500's proprietary oscillator, a measure that tracks how overbought the index is, just crossed 5, a high level that often indicates that a correction is imminent.
The most important thing for investors now is to know what they own and do their homework on the stocks in their portfolios regardless of how diversified they are, Cramer said.
""I am urging you to be careful,"" he said. ""At this point, the odds do favor a pullback. It could give you a better chance to buy. Notice I'm not saying, 'Sell.' I'm just saying I want you to be ready.""
With that in mind, Cramer turned to the stocks and events he'll keep a close eye on next week.
 Know Your IPO: Switch

Rob Roy, founder and chief executive officer of Switch Inc., center, rings the opening bell before the company's initial public offering (IPO) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Friday, Oct. 6, 2017.
 Cramer rarely fails to notice new players arriving on the data center scene, which is why Switch's initial public offering on Friday caught his attention.
""After digging into this story, I think the pros do outweigh the cons, although I'm obviously not alone in believing that, as the stock surged from $17, where it came public today, up to $20.84. That's a 22 percent gain right out of the gate,"" he said. ""Which begs the question: is Switch worth owning even after today's monster move?""
With a book of high-profile clients including Amazon and eBay already under its belt, Switch claims to offer an advanced kind of data center replete with patented cooling systems and powerful machines equipped to handle businesses' sensitive, complex and regulated data.
""The fact is this is a pretty lucrative business. I told you I love the data center,"" Cramer said. ""However, while Switch is intriguing, it also has some issues that we've got to address here.""
 Marriott Vacations Worldwide CEO on Millennials
 Chip East | Reuters
Steve Weisz (C), CEO of Marriott Vacations Worldwide, rings the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
 When you think of typical timeshare owners, social-media-shackled millennials may not seem like the prime example.
But Steve Weisz, the president and CEO of public timeshare provider Marriott Vacations Worldwide, told CNBC's Jim Cramer that the data suggest otherwise.
""[According to] some interesting statistics not only that we see, but also through the Timeshare Trade Association and the American Resort Development Association, the number of Gen X, Gen Y and millennials continues to grow as a percentage of the new-owner buyers that are coming into the marketplace,"" Weisz told the ""Mad Money"" host in an exclusive interview on Friday.
""While I think the traditional belief is that this is somewhat of a 'boomer' product, I believe that the statistics are proving that not to be true at all,"" the CEO added.
 Putting a Lid on Costco Shares?
 Finally, Cramer expanded on his morning commentary on Costco. Shares of the wholesale retailer closed down 6 percent on Friday after its post-earnings conference call, in which analysts pushed a narrative of Amazon overshadowing Costco's future success.
""Here's the CliffNotes version of this call: millennials don't like to go to Costco. They'd rather go to Amazon. Membership growth isn't as robust among younger people, so the aging of its core demographic — 52 is the average — will, in the end, mean that Costco's stock is no longer a bargain no matter what,"" Cramer recalled.
Even though Costco's earnings report beat Wall Street's profit and same-store sales estimates, Cramer warned investors not to buy this particular dip because of its Amazon ties.
""In this market, once Amazon locks its phasers on you, nothing's ever going to be the same,"" he said. ""So down $10's not enough to immunize Costco's stock from further declines. The reality is Amazon's efforts are putting a lid on Costco's stock and they've taken away the floor.""
 Lightning Round: GE's Corporate Shake-Up
 In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
General Electric Company: ""I am shocked. Jeff Bornstein, the CFO, is out there. A new CFO coming in, Jamie Miller. Things are happening so quickly there. My charitable trust owns GE. It's been a disaster. I like to call when they're good, so why not say when they're bad? Maybe this is a shake-up that's necessary.""
Easterly Government Properties Inc.: ""It's got a good yield. I think it's a safe yield. I think that the answer is yes [it's a buy], unless you think interest rates are going to skyrocket, and I don't.""

 Celgene takes new approach to multiple myeloma treatment   
 8:19  AM ET Mon, 11 Dec 2017 |  04:28 
 A new approach to treating patients suffering from an aggressive form of blood cancer could increase survival rates 10-fold to 20 years, Celgene CEO Mark Alles told CNBC on Monday.
 Celgene and Bluebird Bio announced on Sunday updated, positive results from their early stage study on a therapy for people with multiple myeloma — a blood cancer that develops in plasma cells, affecting hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. each year.
The Phase 1 clinical study demonstrated encouraging results in treating patients with late-stage relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma. The treatment is a type of so-called CAR T-cell therapy — taking a patient's own immune cells, called T cells, genetically manipulating them to attack specific proteins on cancer, and infusing them back into the patient.
 ""Ten years ago, the median survival for myeloma was about two years,"" Alles said on ""Squawk Box"" at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in Atlanta. ""Today, with CAR T ... we're going to see people live 20, 30 years without the disease.""
""The quality of responses is unbelievable,"" Alles said about the treatment. ""We have an almost 100 percent response rate,"" he added. ""It's unprecedented.""
CNBC asked Celgene to clarify whether Alles meant Celgene's CAR T treatment or other currently approved drugs would result in people living longer.
A spokesperson for Celgene said: ""Interestingly, it's a little of both. We see anecdotal cases of patients living 20 years and beyond with sequencing of the many current options available [that definitely weren't there when they were diagnosed]. With new therapies like CAR T, the hope is that we continue to see more of these cases.""
On the study results, Bluebird stock soared 22 percent to around $209.50 per share on Monday. Celgene shares gained 2.6 percent to $108.79. Analysts, including a team from Suntrust, raised their price targets on both companies.
Celgene plans to begin enrolling patients this month for a larger, potentially pivotal trial that could position the new treatment to become the third approved CAR T-cell therapy.
Alles said Monday the company will investigate whether patients are ""cured"" or rather ""in a chronic stage of remission.""
""The data follow up will tell,"" he said.

Celgene
 Celgene is in talks to buy biotechnology company Juno Therapeutics, The Wall Street Journal reported. 
 Shares of Juno soared 50 percent in premarket trading Wednesday on the report.
The news comes less than a week after the biotech giant announced it would buy Impact Biomedicines for $7 billion. Both Impact and Juno offer drugs that could boost Celgene in the market for blood-cancer treatment.
 Celgene has been fighting to diversify its portfolio before its best-selling blood-cancer drug, Revlimid, loses patent protection, the Journal reported.
Jefferies analysts called the potential acquisition ""smart,"" because ""the buyout would enable Celgene to integrate Juno's entire cell therapy platform and bring it all in house.""
Celgene has had an estimated $500 million stake in Juno since September 2017, according to a report from Jefferies.
Talks could lead to a deal in the coming weeks, sources familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal. Terms of a possible deal were not revealed.
Shares of Juno Therapeutics soared more than 34 percent on the news.
Representatives from Juno Therapeutics declined to comment to CNBC. Celgene did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

15,2018-01-18,A major cancer drugmaker may need to buy its way out of a looming disaster  ,"Source: Juno Therapeutics
 A buyout of Juno Therapeutics could help Celgene diversify its drug portfolio as its No. 1 cancer treatment, which accounts for the bulk of its sales, approaches patent expiration, analysts say.
 Celgene loses patent protection by 2022 for Revlimid, its top-selling multiple myeloma drug that brought in about 60 percent of fiscal third quarter revenue of nearly $3.3 billion.
""The clock is ticking,"" Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, told CNBC. Once the patent runs out, Celgene could feel pressure from generics within a few years, he said.
 Some analysts said the impact could be blunted through acquisitions.
Salim Syed, senior biotech analyst at Mizuho Securities, told CNBC that shareholders have been pressing New Jersey-based Celgene to make more acquisitions and boost its stock price.
 Earlier this month, Celgene agreed to buy privately held Impact Biomedicines for as much as $7 billion, making the reported Juno interest surprising to some industry watchers.
The Wall Street Journal reported late Tuesday that Celgene is in talks to buy Juno, whose shares shot up more than 50 percent the next day and were up more than 2 percent on Thursday. Juno told CNBC it doesn't comment on market rumors or speculation. Celgene did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
 It's unclear how much Celgene would pay for Juno, which had a market value of $7.9 billion as of Wednesday's close of trading.
 Syed said investors could argue, however, that Celgene already has a decent collaboration with Juno and therefore does not need to do a deal. 
Celgene is working with Seattle-based Juno on an experimental new gene therapy designed to treat people with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
 The treatment is a type of so-called CAR T-cell therapy — taking a patient's own immune cells, called T cells, genetically manipulating them to attack specific proteins on cancer, and infusing them back into the patient.
David Nierengarten, head of health-care equity research at Wedbush, told CNBC, ""Juno wasn't on my list of companies being acquired in the near term.""
But he said, ""Celgene has a big revenue hole to fill over the next few years"" and Juno's treatment could potentially ""fill that gap.""
Nierengarten also sees the potential value in Celgene owning Juno before a product launch ""so they can have control over the regulatory process"" as well as ""setting up sites and infrastructure for this kind of therapy.""
Juno said it could expect approval for its treatment as early as the end of 2018.
CAR T-cell therapy is a highly competitive and potentially lucrative area of biotechnology.
Novartis and Gilead Sciences already received the first two approvals of CAR T for other types of cancer. For one-time treatments, they cost $475,000 and $373,000, respectively.

 Celgene buying Juno Therapeutics for $9 billion   
 7:33  AM ET Mon, 22 Jan 2018 |  01:25 
 Celgene agreed on Monday to buy the rest of Juno Therapeutics it doesn't already own for about $9 billion in cash to gain access to Juno's pipeline of CAR-T cancer drugs.
 Celgene owns 9.7 percent in Juno and will offer $87 per share for the rest of the company. Shares of Juno Therapeutics were up 27 percent on the news, to just below the offering price.
The clock was ticking for Celgene, Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, told CNBC last week.
 Celgene loses patent protection by 2022 for Revlimid, its top-selling multiple myeloma drug that brought in about 60 percent of fiscal third quarter revenue of nearly $3.3 billion.

 Juno said it could expect approval for its treatment by the end of 2018.
""The acquisition of Juno builds on our shared vision to discover and develop transformative medicines for patients with incurable blood cancers,"" Celgene CEO Mark Alles said in a statement Monday.
""Juno's advanced cellular immunotherapy portfolio and research capabilities strengthen Celgene's global leadership in hematology and adds new drivers for growth beyond 2020.""
The news comes about a week after the biotech giant announced it would buy Impact Biomedicines for $7 billion. Both Impact and Juno offer drugs that could boost Celgene in the market for blood-cancer treatment.
