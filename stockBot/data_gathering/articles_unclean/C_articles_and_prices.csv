3,2017-06-15,Apple should buy Athenahealth to expand in health care: Citigroup  ,"Sally Shin | CNBC
Tim Cook
 As Apple moves into health care, it's acquired a few small start-ups.
 Now, Citigroup analyst Garen Sarafian is recommending that the company scoop up a far larger player in health technology: Athenahealth. 
Even with a market capitalization of close to $6 billion, the purchase would make sense, Sarafian wrote in a note to clients, as it could help Apple solve one of the biggest's issues in health care -- the interoperable exchange of medical data.
 Sarafian's analysis followed a report on Wednesday from CNBC that Apple is looking to turn the iPhone into the central bank for patient health information. 
Apple has more than 1 billion iPhone users but limited access to clinical systems that capture data in hospitals. Meanwhile, according to Sarafian, Athenahealth offers access to around 83 million patient records and has a track record of integrating with clinical IT systems like Epic and Cerner. The company also has access to a network of about half of all U.S. doctors through its mobile health app Epocrates. 
Sarafian has a ""buy"" recommendation on Athenahealth.

Michael Corbat, chief executive officer of Citigroup Inc.
 Now that Citigroup has aced the Federal Reserve's latest stress test, it needs a strategy. The $188 billion U.S. bank doubled its dividend and boosted its share buyback by $15.6 billion after clearing the exam. Chief Executive Mike Corbat has been understandably laser-focused on returning capital and appeasing watchdogs, objectives that eluded his predecessor and lifted him into the job. Spurring growth to match bigger investor payouts is a trickier challenge.
Corbat was brought in as Citi's chief in 2012, after the bank failed the test for the first time under Vikram Pandit. The bank failed again in 2014, leaving Corbat stunned. With his job at stake, Corbat persuaded an executive to delay retirement and take over the examination process. The bank spent $180 million to improve its systems and streamlined operations.

 Citi beats Street's expectations on top and bottom line   
 8:30  AM ET Fri, 14 July 2017 |  00:43 
 Citigroup reported better-than-expected second-quarter results Friday. The stock, however, fell 1 percent after the bank reported a slowdown in trading results.
 The bank posted earnings per share of $1.28 on revenue of $17.901 billion, topping analyst expectations. That's compared to earnings of $1.24 per share on $17.548 billion in revenue in the year-ago period. 
Here's how Citigroup's results compared Wall Street's expectations:
 EPS: $1.28 vs. $1.21 expected by Thomson One analysts' consensus. Revenue: $17.901 billion vs. $17.367 billion expected by Thomson One. 
""The $3.9 billion of net income helped generate additional regulatory capital. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio grew to 13.0%, well above the 11.5% we believe we need to prudently operate the firm,"" Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said in a statement.

The silhouette of a pedestrian holding a mobile device is seen walking past a Citigroup bank branch in San Francisco.
 That said, Citigroup's ""Markets and Securities Services"" revenue declined by 5 percent to $4.388 billion year over year, largely because of an 11 percent pullback in equity markets sales. In a release, the bank said the decline in equities trading reflected ""episodic activity in the prior year period, as well as low volatility in the current quarter.""
Citigroup also said its fixed income markets revenue totaled $3.215 billion, down from $3.432 billion in the prior-year period and down from $3.622 billion in the first quarter of this year. 
JPMorgan Chase — which also reported quarterly results Friday — also noted its trading revenue fell year on year.
Citigroup's loans grew by 2 percent year on year to $645 billion while deposits also climbed 2 percent to $959 billion.
Across different regions, the company's overall revenue grew 5 percent year over year in North America and 10 percent in emerging markets.
""Core businesses are performing well. We're seeing better loan performance for both the consumer and corporate businesses,"" said Ken Leon, bank analyst at CFRA. ""I think it was a pretty solid quarter.""
Shares of Citigroup have risen more than 15 percent over the past month, boosted by a sharp jump in sovereign bond yields and positive stress test results from the Federal Reserve.
Citigroup shares over past month
 Source: FactSet
The benchmark 10-year note yield has jumped from approximately 2.2 percent to 2.33 percent. The move higher was triggered by hawkish rhetoric from officials at the Fed and the European Central Bank.
The Fed has signaled it intends to start unwinding its massive $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year. The central bank is also expected to raise interest rates once more this year. The ECB, meanwhile, has hinted at the possibility of tapering its quantitative easing program sometime next year.
The bank's stock also benefited from the Fed approving stock repurchase programs for all the major U.S. banks. The Fed's blessing led to Citi announcing its biggest buyback program ever and to double its quarterly dividend.
Citigroup's first-quarter results topped analysts' expectations, helped by a jump in bond trading.
Earlier Friday, PNC Financial Services earnings also topped analysts' expectations. Wells Fargo, meanwhile, posted mixed results, with sales disappointing and earnings beating estimates.

 Banks turn lower despite earnings beats   
 7:38  PM ET Fri, 14 July 2017 |  03:01 
 As earnings seasons approached, investors flocked to financial stocks on anticipation that the high hopes for the sector would come true. So far, it's been an expensive losing bet.
 Bank shares slumped Friday in an early but important round of profit reports. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup — Nos. 1, 3 and 4 in terms of assets — each disappointed the market for various reasons. 
Financials broadly fell more than 1 percent by midday, and the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index specifically was off 1.2 percent. Wells Fargo dropped about 2 percent.
 That comes as investors have been pumping cash into an exchange-traded fund that tracks the industry, the Financial Select Sector SDPR. The ETF has hauled in just shy of $900 million in July — about a 3.6 percent gain in assets just for the period — as investors bet big on the banks.
Despite the decline Friday, no one is panicking yet. Indeed, ratings firm CFRA kept its buy recommendation on both JPMorgan and Wells Fargo and raised its price target $2 on each of the stocks.
""A lot of the environment around them is still pretty good just fundamentally,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. ""There's borrowing and lending going on again. With the stock market going to new highs, I think it's going to stoke a little new activity.""
Bank stocks immediately fell in premarket trading after the three big institutions released their earnings reports. They stayed negative through the trading day as investors digested the positions of the Wall Street leaders, and after weak inflation data sent government bond yields lower.
 Joseba Etxaburu | Reuters
 Indeed, Paulsen said the direction of yields will be a critical metric by which to gauge bank performance. 
Should the benchmark 10-year Treasury note break above 2.6 percent, the sector stands to benefit, he said. The road will be different under lower bond yields, in which case earnings will take more prominence.
""I think we break out [on yields]. If we do, they'll be OK,"" Paulsen said. ""Some of the sales have been weak, but that would be helped if you can raise the yield structure and steepen the curve again.""
That yield dynamic has created some uncertainty in the market lately. While Federal Reserve officials have indicated their desire to bring interest rates back to levels closer to historical norms, the inflation numbers have not been cooperating.
Consumer price index data Friday showed surprisingly weak pricing pressures, with June prices unchanged. The Fed is determined to bring inflation back up to 2 percent annualized, but the CPI now points to just a 1.6 percent reading.
However, Kevin Quigg, chief strategist at ACSI Funds, said the sector has other factors in its favor.
""The industry as a whole is in very good shape. Everyone passed the stress test for the first time in seven years,"" Quigg said, referencing the exams banks must pass to show that they can withstand another financial crisis. Each bank involved in the tests received approval for their plans to distribute capital to shareholders.
""There's also deregulation. There certainly will be a look into regulations. That's a real tail wind for the industry,"" added Quigg, whose fund has positions in Citi, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.
To be sure, not everyone is a fan.
Kevin O'Leary, who runs the O'Shares ETF family and is a judge on ABC""s ""Shark Tank,"" a program that also is syndicated on CNBC, believes the big bank stock run is at least taking a break for a while.
""This is the pause that refreshes going forward,"" O'Leary said on ""Fast Money Halftime Report."" He pointed to comments from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon earlier in the day expressing frustration with the slow pace of fiscal reforms in Congress.
""In his words are caution,"" O'Leary said. ""I think if you're looking for what's going to make things work in financials, you don't have to own banks.""

10,2017-07-19,Citigroup Said to Open Frankfurt Hub as Banks Consider Post-'Brexit' Moves  ,"Mario Tama | Getty Images
A 'Citi' sign is displayed outside Citigroup Center near Citibank headquarters in Manhattan on December 5, 2012 in New York City.
 Score one for Frankfurt.
With Britain locked in negotiations with the European Union over their post-""Brexit"" relationship, the financial companies that dominate London's economy have forged ahead, eager to ensure they can continue to serve clients across the Continent. That has set other European cities scrambling to win a slice of the business that the British capital has long kept for itself.
The American banking giant Citigroup is taking a step toward reducing its dependence on London and will open a second trading hub in Frankfurt, said a person familiar with the bank's plans, who was not authorized to speak publicly about them and so spoke anonymously. The bank has had an operation in Frankfurt for decades, but it would expand its business there with this latest decision.
 The development is largely symbolic, with a relatively small number of staff members in London expected to move to Germany. But it is another trickle of job losses that some British business and political leaders fear could turn into a flood in the coming months and years, as the full picture of the nation's future trading relationship with the European Union becomes clear.
Britain's membership in the 28-nation bloc has bolstered London's position as a global financial hub in part because European rules allow ""passporting,"" under which a banking license in a single member-state allows a lender to work throughout the European Union.
But it is unclear whether Britain will be able to retain that access. Other questions affecting banks also remain unanswered, including whether European citizens will be able to continue to live and work in Britain, and if so, under what sort of visa.

 FT:  The case for stopping Brexit   
 7:17  AM ET Tue, 18 July 2017 |  01:59 
 The European Union could also  restrict the clearing outside the bloc of complex financial contracts known as derivatives when they are denominated in euros, further sidelining London.
While most financial companies have said they would prefer to stay in London — home to some of the world's biggest financial markets and a wide variety of support industries like accountants and lawyers — they also must ensure they can continue to operate across the European Union.
Citi's decision shows how financial services companies are trying to strike that balance.
The bank employs about 19,000 people in the European Union, including around 6,000 in London. A vast majority of its investment banking and trading jobs in London will remain in place, according to the person. But the bank will obtain a broker dealer license in Frankfurt so it can continue trading and offering investment banking services across the European Union.
The jobs that may shift to Frankfurt form a small percentage of the overall figures. And while other financial companies have announced plans to move employees or to make new hires in Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris and even Luxembourg, most of those plans have also involved relatively few people.
Still, that has not stopped cities on the Continent — particularly Frankfurt and Paris — from making an aggressive sales pitch to business leaders, hoping to eventually lure tens of thousand of workers.

Britain has started the clock on leaving the European Union, and will be out of the bloc by March 2019. Here is how ""Brexit"" has affected business so far.
 The lobbying group Europlace Paris said this year that it hoped to attract as many as 20,000 financial jobs, and the new president of France, Emmanuel Macron, has  pledged to change labor laws to make the country more economically competitive.
Frankfurt, despite being viewed by some as a sleepier city, has at least one definite advantage: It is the home to the European Central Bank, the region's chief banking regulator.
Stefan Winter, the chairman of the industry group Association of Foreign Banks in Germany,  told the newspaper Welt am Sonntag last month that Frankfurt could add 3,000 to 5,000 jobs in the next two years as a result of Britain's leaving the bloc.
Frankfurt Main Finance, another lobbying organization, has estimated that as many as 10,000 new jobs could move to the city over the next five years.
In a  news release after reports that Citigroup was planning to move the jobs to Germany, Frankfurt Main Finance said the city was in the ""pole position"" to win banking business from London.
""Noted for its strong economic and political stability, Frankfurt and the region offer a top infrastructure, competitively priced and plentiful modern office space, a deep talent pool and an extremely high quality of life,"" Frankfurt Main Finance said.

 And while much appears unclear, one thing is certain: Banks in London are pushing ahead with contingency plans.
The British lender Barclays said last week that it was in talks with Irish regulators to expand the license of its Barclays Bank Ireland subsidiary to continue to serve European Union clients, while HSBC has said it could move as many as 1,000 people to Paris.
The American International Group and other insurers have picked Luxembourg for their European hubs, while the insurance marketplace Lloyd's of London has settled on Brussels for its new European Union subsidiary.
But Citigroup will not find itself alone in Germany.
The Japanese companies Daiwa Securities, Nomura and the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group have said they will set up outposts in Frankfurt. Standard Chartered, which is based in Britain but generates much of its income in Asia, has said it was in discussions with regulators about opening a subsidiary in Frankfurt.
Richard Gnodde, the head of Goldman Sachs in Europe, told the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung last month that the investment bank could double its staff in the city.

Michael Corbat, chief executive officer of Citigroup Inc.
 Citi shares rose 3 percent in opening trade Tuesday as the financial firm provided more optimistic projections for profit growth during its first investor day since May 2008. 
 ""As you know, it has been a while since we have hosted an Investor Day,"" Citi CEO Michael Corbat said in prepared remarks Tuesday.
The bank said it expects to boost profit per share by 80 percent over the next three years, from $5 to $9, largely through share buybacks and the performance of its businesses. It said its projections imply a stock price of around $100. The shares are trading around $68 now.
 The bank also recently said it would double its quarterly dividend to 32 cents.
Citi hasn't hosted an investor day since the financial crisis, a wrenching time for the financial industry and Citi itself. 
""Some people have asked why now?"" Corbat said. ""We chose this time because we, the management and our board, believe Citi has crossed an inflection point."" 
The bank will reach an 11 percent return on tangible common equity by 2020, according to a slide from CFO John Gerspach's presentation.
""We are now clearly on a path to both growth and stronger returns,"" Corbat said.

 Comcast should buy Verizon for $215 billion, Citi analyst says   
 10:55  AM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 |  00:48 
 Comcast Corp. should buy Verizon Communications, a deal that could be worth $215 billion, an analyst from Citigroup said Wednesday.
 Though many view Verizon as a likely suitor for Dish Network, the analyst said Comcast could swoop in with a deal for the wireless carrier that would help it extend internet connectivity outside the home. 
The analyst estimates Comcast could pay a 20 percent premium to Verizon's share price, which was $43.98 at the close of trading Tuesday. Verizon's shares are down more than 17 percent this year, so much so that Comcast, the parent of NBCUniversal, is now bigger in terms of market value, Citi analyst Jason Bazinet wrote in a research note on Wednesday.
 Verizon's market value was $179 billion as of Tuesday's close, so a 20 percent premium would put a deal value at $215 billion.
""It's a call Comcast should make ... and Verizon should take,"" wrote Bazinet in the note. Verizon shares were up more than 1 percent in morning trading, while Comcast shares were flat.
The research cites press reports that indicate Verizon could be open to a deal with Disney, CBS or Comcast.
A spokesman from Comcast and a spokeswoman for Verizon both declined to comment.
It is a time of rapid consolidation in the media and telecommunications industries. Companies that create content are looking for more efficient ways to distribute it at a time when many households are moving to streaming services from Netflix and Amazon.com. Comcast bought NBCUniversal in 2009 and attempted a deal with Time Warner Cable in 2014, but called it off the next year.
Telecom giant AT&T and media giant Time Warner are waiting on regulatory approval for their $80 billion combination, which would marry video content with delivery on mobile devices.
Bazinet said in his note that the regulatory climate may be more amenable under the current administration to big combinations.
A Comcast-Verizon tie-up could boost revenue at the combined company, he said. He estimates Comcast would have to sell about 16 percent of its cable operations where it overlaps with Verizon's FiOS network.
 Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

 Citi CEO Michael Corbat: Trade is not dead   
 10:08  AM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 |  02:00 
 Citigroup investors don't need to be concerned about trade under President Donald Trump, CEO Michael Corbat told CNBC on Wednesday.
 In part of a ""Mad Money"" interview airing in its entirety Wednesday evening, CNBC's Jim Cramer asked Corbat if he needs to worry about Trump's tough talk on trade.
Corbat responded, by saying: ""Trade is not dead. Trade is secular, not cyclical.""
 ""When we look at growth rates, sure, the whole world slowed. But the relationship between the developed and developing markets [is] very much intact. Emerging markets [are] still growing at nearly two times the pace of developed markets,"" Corbat said.
On Tuesday, Citigroup outlined an ambitious plan to grow profit and return at least $60 billion to shareholders. In its first major investor conference in more than nine years, management described the blueprint as a sign Citi has finally regained its footing after the 2008 financial crisis when it needed three bailouts to survive. 
Earlier this month, Citigroup reported better-than-expected second-quarter results. But the bank mentioned a slowdown in stock trading results.

 Citigroup's Michael Corbat: We benefit from online shopping and the Amazon effect   
 3:32  PM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 |  03:00 
 The all-consuming ""Amazon effect"" online is more beneficial than many Citigroup investors may think, Citi CEO Michael Corbat told CNBC.
 ""What people have missed is ... [credit] card usage has actually gone up,"" Corbat said in a wide-ranging interview with ""Mad Money""host Jim Cramer on Wednesday.
""Sure, Amazon has benefited, but other online retailers benefit [too],"" argued the CEO of one of the nation's top credit card issuers. ""Today, only about 20 to 30 percent of purchases in stores happen on credit cards. About 100 percent [of purchases] happen online with credit cards. So we benefit from that. And if you think of our partners — Home Depot and American and Costco and all of those — we've definitely got to benefit from that.""
 In a 2016 study led by credit card processor Total System Services, researchers found credit cards topped the list of consumers' preferred payment methods for the first time ever.
Even with those tail winds from the increased use of plastic, Citigroup last week lowered its forecast for returns on branded credit cards. Citi CFO John Gerspach attributed the change to rising interest rates and the bank's Costco-branded card bringing in more revenue and income but with a lower return.
However, on Tuesday, Citi executives expressed a positive outlook for profit growth at Citigroup's first investor day since the 2008 financial crisis.

 Citigroup CEO touts Costco partnership   
 7:04  PM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 |  01:00 
 Citigroup's partnership with Costco may be old news, but Citi CEO Michael Corbat said he still considers the deal, which the big bank took from competitor American Express, a huge success.
 In a wide-ranging interview with ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer, Corbat said the deal with Costco to issue the retailer's branded credit cards was much larger than it may have initially seemed.
""If I came in and said, 'Jim, let me tell you about a deal that we're gonna do. And that deal is going to be with a terrific partner, one of the best retailers in the world. And in that deal we're going to bring in $10, $11 billion of receivables. We're gonna bring in new cardholders. And those cardholders, in a single year, are going to spend $100 billion on that card,' think about it,"" Corbat said.
 The 16-year-long deal between American Express and Costco expired in March 2016. Since then, the discount retail chain has partnered with Citi for its credit cards and Visa for its rewards program. 
""Costco's a great partner,"" Corbat said. ""It's a great company. And the receptivity of our cardholders and the usage of the cardholders has been great.""

 });Despite his position as the chief of one of the world's top banks, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat takes pride in not having an executive office of his own.
 ""I don't have an office. I've got a cubicle. It's a nice cubicle, but I've got a cubicle,"" Corbat tells ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Wednesday in a wide-ranging interview about his company.
A self-proclaimed believer in the power of communication, Corbat finds it critical to be able to connect with his employees in an increasingly digital world.
 ""In a day to day where people are tweeting, chatting and there's a distance in those communications, I want to create, construct, what we call 'constructive collisions' in our people's day,"" the CEO says.
Corbat says that at a massive company like Citi, which employs over 200,000 people worldwide, it is crucial to have information moving through the company, both from the top down and from the bottom up.

 ""We felt, as a leadership team, we can't ask people to give up their offices or what they do until we do it. So we went, we moved to cubicles, and I would say that while people were uncertain at the start, the team loves it,"" the CEO says. ""Information flows, there's no doors, we come and go from each other's spaces, we hold meetings together, there's a trust factor there in terms of communication, and I think it's resonating in the rest of the firm.""

 Citi CEO Corbat: We've been repairing a lot of relationships   
 9:06  PM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 |  01:01 
 Following Citigroup's first investor day since the 2008 recession, CEO Michael Corbat said his bank has been primarily focused on positioning itself to take advantage of a changing industry.
 ""We've repaired a lot of relationships,"" Corbat told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Wednesday. ""From a credit perspective, from an earnings perspective, from a business model perspective, we put the company through a massive restructuring, and now we're showing what the company can do.""
Corbat said the goal has been to bring Citi back to its roots as a bank, done in part by exiting dozens of secondary businesses and scaling back some $800 million in core assets.
 ""If you look at how we've defined growth, we've gone from 60 consumer markets to 40, we've gone from covering 32,000 institutional clients to 14,"" the CEO said. ""We think, within our own target client base, there's plenty of growth.""
On top of that, Corbat said the bank aims to return at least $20 billion in capital to its shareholders via dividend increases and share buybacks in the next two years.
That said, Citi is no less involved in financial markets. Dubbing his bank ""the largest mover of money in the world"" as well as the largest global issuer of credit cards, Corbat suggested that with its efficient capital structure, Citi could lead the world into the next era of payments.
""Think about it: the world's largest mover of money, the world's biggest payment company. Think of the big data that we generate and the information we get and the view we get,"" he told Cramer. ""We've got 120 million consumers who interact with us. We've got companies, governments, universities. We see all their flows. And our ability to take that data and use it ... and the investments we're making in technology we think pave the way for the future.""
Corbat said that when Citi's management first set the goal of being ""the best digital bank,"" they quickly amended that vision when they realized that everything in banking would eventually be digital.
Now, as financial companies from PayPal to Goldman Sachs race to capitalize on digital payment methods, Corbat finds Citigroup in a good spot to seize on those developments.
""We've got, probably, the best fintech laboratory in the world,"" the CEO said. ""Three, four, five years from now, we're not going to be talking about credit cards. We're just going to be talking about digital payments.""
And as the company undergoes employee churn, letting go of roughly 40,000 employees but adding 9,000 in its regulation and compliance division, Corbat said the focus remains on using technology to drive business.
""I would say that those areas, like many areas in banking today, remain ripe for the introduction of technology to help us and make us smarter. Artificial intelligence, robotics, all of those things we're using today, and we think there's a terrific trajectory in terms of how we can use them in the future.""

 Citi beats Street on top and bottom line   
 8:30  AM ET Thu, 12 Oct 2017 |  01:09 
 Citigroup reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday, as its global consumer business showed further revenue growth.
 Here's how the banking giant's results fared against Wall Street estimates:
 EPS: $1.42 vs $1.32 expected by a Thomson Reuters survey Revenue: $18.173 billion vs $17.896 billion expected Fixed income trading: $2.877 billion vs StreetAccount's projected $2.84 billion 
 But the company's stock closed 3.4 percent lower as of 3 p.m. in New York, after hitting its highest level since 2008.
""Revenue growth remains light, while a sharp rise in the cost of credit bears watching,"" said  Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research, in a note to clients. ""Operating expenses were down 2%, while the cost of credit increased 15%, which management attributed to global consumer banking and a higher credit reserve build.""

 Citi reported a 3 percent year-over-year increase in global consumer banking revenue. In North America, retail banking revenue rose 12 percent, excluding mortgages. Citi cited ""continued growth in loans and assets under management,"" as well as higher interest rates.
The bank's international consumer business saw an 8 percent revenue increase, driven by higher loans and deposit volumes growth.
Citi's end-of-period loans, meanwhile, rose 2 percent to $653 billion, while deposits increased by 3 percent to $964 billion.
""We had revenue increases in many of the products we have been investing in, tightly managed our expenses, and again saw loan growth in both our consumer and institutional businesses,"" Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said in a release.
 Citigroup's $2.877 billion fixed-income trading revenue represents a 16 percent year-over-year decline. The sharp decline was offset by a 16 percent increase in equity trading revenue. Earlier Thursday, JPMorgan reported third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. However, the bank also reported a 27 percent drop in bond trading revenue.
Shares of Citigroup have risen 26 percent this year, easily outperforming the broader market. The S&P 500 has gained 14 percent in 2017.
 Citigroup's stock has also outperformed those of other big banks. Shares of JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are up 11.9 percent and 16.9 percent, respectively.
John Heagerty, research analyst at Atlantic Equities, said in a note last month the stock could see further gains.
""We believe the combination of an inexpensive valuation, substantial capital return, declining cost to income ratio and rising ROE should deliver above peer-group share price performance for C over the next 12-18 months,"" Heagerty said.
Citigroup could also benefit from tighter monetary policy in the near future. The Federal Reserve signaled a December rate hike in the summary of its Sept. 20 meeting.

22,2017-10-13,Dick Bove explains why JPMorgan and Citi sold off: They failed some important tests  ,"show chapters
 How healthy are US banks?   
 9:15  PM ET Thu, 12 Oct 2017 |  01:50 
 JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup failed to deliver on a number of fundamental areas even though they turned in better-than-expected quarterly earnings, one analyst said after investors sold down the two banking stocks. 
 Speaking to CNBC's ""The Rundown"" on Friday, Vertical Group's equity research analyst Dick Bove listed the three areas to look for in any bank earnings: an expansion in loan book, improvement in loan quality and margins that are inching up.
""Citigroup failed on all three of those tests, JPMorgan failed on two of them,"" Bove said.
 ""Both companies were unable to increase their loan volume in any meaningful way — they were up maybe 2 percent year-over-year. Both companies saw an erosion of the quality of their loan portfolios … and one of the two firms, Citigroup, was unable to increase its margins despite the fact that interest rates have been up by some 100 basis points over the last two years,"" he added.
Shares of the two U.S. banking giants closed in the red even as both their quarterly results, released Thursday, beat Wall Street estimates.
JPMorgan's earnings per share came in at $1.76 versus the estimated $1.65, while its revenue of $26.2 billion topped the projected $25.23 billion. Over at Citigroup, earnings per share of $1.42 also beat the $1.32 forecast, while revenue was $18.173 billion, compared to the $17.896 billion expected.
Investors seemed to focus on the negatives instead: JPMorgan's fixed income trading revenue tumbled 27 percent year-over-year to $3.16 billion, while that of Citigroup was down 16 percent to $2.877 billion.
Both banks also set aside more money for credit card losses.
""I think it's part of the normal credit cycle, credit losses have been too low and they're going up,"" Bove said. ""There's also been an erosion in credit quality in consumers and that erosion is related to subprime lending.""
That may add uncertainty about the prospects of banks at a time when commercial loan growth is also slowing, analysts said.
""Loan growth remains challenged for the bank sector as commercial loan growth has been held back by policy uncertainty as well as other funding options available to companies through the capital markets,"" CreditSights analysts wrote in a note.

 Is the IMF wrong about bank profitability?   
 12:18  AM ET Thu, 12 Oct 2017 |  03:01 
 The health of banks once again came under the limelight after the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday in a report that nine of the world's largest financial institutions could struggle with profitability in the years ahead. Citigroup was one of the nine banks identified.
The IMF also warned that ""problems in even a single"" one of the banks ""could generate systemic stress.""
But some analysts are optimistic. Bill Stone, global chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management Group, said on CNBC's ""Street Signs"" that both JPMorgan and Citigroup did ""pretty good.""
""Why did they sell off?"" Stone asked. ""I think financials have been on fire, they've been the best-performing sector over the past 30 days so I think there's a bit of 'sell on the news' since we've enjoyed all before the news.""

 Citigroup downgraded on credit quality concerns, 'disappointing' margins   
 2:45  PM ET Mon, 16 Oct 2017 |  00:40 
 Mounting credit concerns and lethargic profit margins will plague ""weak"" Citigroup earnings over the next two years, said one Wall Street research firm.
 Societe Generale reduced its rating on Citigroup shares to sell from hold Monday, citing deteriorating credit trends and increased loan loss provisions as detailed in the bank's most recent earnings report.
""Although revenues were 2 percent ahead of consensus, boosted mainly by capital markets revenues, it is more worrisome that the credit quality of North American cards deteriorated and net interest margin was flat again despite the recent Fed fund rate increase,"" wrote analyst Andrew Lim. ""Earnings momentum is weak.""
 Citigroup earnings beat Wall Street expectations on Thursday, but shares of Citi have fallen more than 3 percent since the report. Group loan loss provisions were $2 billion, 7 percent worse than consensus and 15 percent higher year over year, according to Lim. A loan loss provision is an expense that is reserved for defaulted loans or credit.
Higher loan loss provisions not only eat into earnings, but may also suggest mediocre debtors or poor credit.
""Although part of the uptick in provisions is due to seasonal effects and one-offs like hurricanes,"" conceded Lim, ""we are concerned about the deteriorating trend over several quarters in North America and have adjusted our forecasts accordingly.""
The analyst cut his fiscal 2018 earnings estimate by 0.2 percent, but slashed his 2019 estimate by a significant 11.1 percent, to $6.80. He also reduced his 12-month price target to $65, which is 10 percent below Friday's closing price. His old price target was $70.
Citigroup's net margin also underwhelmed Societe Generale's analyst. That is the difference between what a bank pays in interest on deposits and what it earns on assets like loans.
""Despite the recent 25-basis point increase in the Fed funds rate, Citi's net interest margin was static at 2.72 percent,"" said Lim. ""The weak net interest margin trajectory is disappointing and completely at odds with management's guidance that there should be some positive sensitivity to rising short rates.""
Lim isn't alone in his critical appraisal of Citigroup. Vertical Group equity research analyst Dick Bove told CNBC's ""The Rundown"" last week that Citigroup failed on multiple fronts. Bove also cited Citi's disappointing loan book as well as its inability to capitalize on rising rates.

24,2017-10-19,'Big Short' Steve Eisman says he is betting against Wells Fargo because of deep 'cultural issues'  ,"Katie Rooney | CNBC
Steven Eisman, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman
 Steve Eisman, a fund manager at Neuberger Berman, said Thursday at a conference he is betting Wells Fargo shares will go down, while Citigroup shares will rise.
 Wells Fargo shares have fallen far behind other financial stocks this year as the bank struggles to recover from a consumer sales scandal that broke last year. The stock has now fallen out of favor with a noted investor.
""The cultural issues I think at Wells Fargo went very, very deep,"" Eisman told CNBC in a phone interview. ""They have to unwind these cultural issues."" 
 Eisman expects earnings will be ""flattish"" over the next few years, and pointed to negative signs such as the bank's decline in loans in the third quarter. He said he generally doesn't give price targets. 
Wells Fargo declined to comment to CNBC.
On the other hand, ""Citi is the cheapest large bank,"" Eisman told CNBC. He said he expects plans to reduce regulation will improve Citi's return on equity to 14 or 15 percent from around 8 percent.
Citi also declined to comment.
Eisman famously bet against the housing market by shorting, or betting against, U.S. banks ahead of the financial crisis, which was depicted in the movie ""The Big Short."" In May, Eisman said on CNBC's ""Fast Money"" that he is now investing in ""a whole bunch of banks and investment banks"" and specifically mentioned Citigroup.
Eisman gave his presentation on the bank stocks Thursday at Capitalize for Kids, an investment conference in Toronto, Canada, whose proceeds go towards helping to solve challenges in children's brain and mental health. 
Wells Fargo shares are down nearly 3 percent for the year, among the worst performers in the S&P 500's financials sector. The bank paid $185 million in penalties after it was discovered Wells Fargo employees had opened about 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customers' authorization since 2011. CEO Tim Sloan took over the company in October 2016 and the bank announced a board shakeup this past August. 
Last week, Wells Fargo reported a revenue miss in the third quarter. Shares rose 0.6 percent in midday Thursday trading.
In contrast, Citi reported better-than-expected earnings last week and shares are up nearly 22 percent this year as one of the best performers in the S&P financial sector. Shares recovered some of their losses to trade about 0.7 percent lower Thursday afternoon, amid a broad market decline. 
Financial stocks overall are up more than 12 percent this year.

Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.
 Billionaire Saudi investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said Monday he's bullish on Citigroup shares, arguing that they are ""still below book value.""
 Shares of Citigroup have risen nearly 50 percent over the past 12 months as the banking sector continues to pick itself back up after the financial recession. They closed Friday at $73.53.
""I'm really happy with Citibank right now. Even with the big jump right now, they're still below book value,"" Alwaleed told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""There's still plenty of room for Citigroup to go above 100 right now.""
 Alwaleed noted that since President Donald Trump's election, the financial sector has been recovering steadily, especially on hopes of tax reform and deregulation. Citi has been a long-time investment of Alwaleed's Kingdom Holding.
""The environment right now for the banking industry is very favorable,"" he continued. ""Less regulation also is helping the banks also. So less regulations, more control by the banks, [who] learned the lessons of the last decade.""
Trump and Republican politicians have advocated the repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act, a major piece of banking regulations adopted in the wake of the Great Recession, and the loosening of some capital and liquidity requirements in a bid to ease banks' ability to lend.

A customer poses with an iPhone X after being the first to buy one upon its release in the U.K, on November 3, 2017 in London.
 As Apple shares soared to a new record after stellar earnings, Citigroup sees five more reasons why it believes the stock will trade even higher in the year to come.
 The company has had an amazing year thus far, adding 49 percent in stock value since January and launching one of the biggest upgrades to its iPhone in generations.
On top of that, Apple reported stellar earnings on Thursday, crushing Street estimates on nearly every metric. Earnings per share of $2.07 crushed expectations of $1.87, revenue climbed to $52.6 billion and iPhone units sales notched 46.7 million, even before the iPhone X hit most stores.
 ""We detail out the 5 reasons Apple stock can trade higher despite the stock up 47 percent year to date compared to the S&P 500 up 15 percent,"" added Suva. ""Yes we believe Apple can return to sustainable growth post iPhone 8.""

 Trump's D.C. will drive bank stocks higher   
 6:40  PM ET Thu, 30 Nov 2017 |  01:13 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer hates parabolic moves, like the one he noticed in bitcoin's rapid surge on Wednesday.
 ""I particularly despise parabolic rallies, the kind with a huge upward slope, when you see them in slower growing industries. There's a word for that kind of action, and the word is 'unsustainable,'"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Yet that's exactly what's been happening with the bank stocks in the last 72 hours, parabolic moves that seem hard to justify based on the numbers.""
The pattern worried Cramer because he knew the bank stocks — namely Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America — couldn't keep going up at this speed. It dragged everything into question: their valuations, their earnings and whether they were safe investments.
 Moreover, the XLF, the exchange-traded fund that lumps the financials in a group, makes those details difficult to pin down.
The ETF causes the financials to trade in unison based on how many times the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates, as each hike means more profit for the banks.
""The thing is, they really shouldn't be trading in lockstep,"" Cramer said. ""Some of these banks are dramatically undervalued on certain metrics. For example, [Citigroup's] tangible book value — what it would be worth if you shut down the company and liquidated everything — is just below the current stock price. That's too cheap.""
By his fairly conservative estimates, Cramer predicted another 5 percent rise for the XLF based on the possibility for four more rate hikes.
Bank of America would be a particularly big beneficiary of hikes thanks to its large deposit base, which would justify its seemingly inflated valuation. Plus, with the Trump administration unraveling Obama-era regulations on banks, Bank of America's earnings power can go up more than people realize, Cramer said.
""It's very difficult to argue that the stock's expensive. And other than the pricey JPMorgan, I could say the same thing about most of the [bank] stocks: they're still too cheap,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""So, sure, you can trim your positions in the banks, since no one likes to be a pig,"" he continued. ""But unlike so many other areas where valuations are getting pretty stretched, I think the financials, on the whole, have room to run, maybe a lot of room to run now that we have a government that's way more pro-banking than any I have ever seen.""

 As both Ethereum and Litecoin soared to new record highs Tuesday, the combined market value of cryptocurrencies hit an all-time high of $506 billion at about 7:40 a.m. ET Wednesday, according to Coinmarketcap data.
That figure is worked out by multiplying the prices of cryptocurrencies by the total volume of those digital tokens in circulation.
 The market has seen unprecedented interest from investors as of late, and is now worth more than the market cap of billionaire Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway, which is currently valued at around $491 billion.

A pedestrian passes a Tiffany & Co. sign.
 Shares of Tiffany & Co. jumped 4 percent Thursday after Citigroup upgraded the luxury retailer to buy, saying the jeweler is ""starting to show some shine.""
 ""The third quarter brought several positive inflection points, new management is showing us that they understand the challenges and opportunities, and they are not sitting still,"" Citi analyst Paul Lejuez explained. ""Considering the increasing tailwind from FX and the likely earnings per share lift from tax reform (which we don't believe is priced in), we believe Tiffany looks attractive.""
It has been a busy year at Tiffany with ""significant"" changes to both the board and management. Though the company typically debuted major collections every few years, it added both CEO Alessandro Bogliolo and head designer Reed Krakoff this year in an effort to jump-start sales with new blood and more frequent product launches.
 ""Tiffany launched its HardWare collection of jewelry and (more recently) its home/accessories line, as well as opening the Blue Box Café in its NYC flagship,"" explained Lejuez. ""We are optimistic that the changes we have seen thus far have Tiffany on a better path for success.""
The new HardWare collection features pieces like a $12,000 link bracelet in 18-karat rose gold.
Shares of Tiffany are up 28 percent this year versus the S&P 500's 19 percent climb, with 9 percentage points of the stock's surge coming in the last three months. Tiffany stock closed up 3.4 percent higher Thursday after the call.
The analyst raised his price target on Tiffany to $115 from $92. The new target is 20 percent higher than Wednesday's closing price.
Meanwhile, Citi has more reason to favor the luxury retailer. Citi's European luxury goods analyst Thomas Chauvet said he believes the company could be an attractive acquisition target. Chauvet and his team find ""increasing probability"" that a European luxury conglomerate could make a move to buy Tiffany or one of its segments, potentially boosting the shares further.
Tiffany & Co. did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

A pedestrian passes in front of a statue of a bull in the Wall Street area in New York City.
 Citigroup strategists now see the S&P 500 ending 2018 a modest 4 percent above current levels without much more help from tax cuts.
 Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief U.S. equity strategist, had previously based his forecast on a corporate tax rate cut to 25 percent, but he has updated it because the tax bill that is nearing completion slashes the corporate rate to 21 percent.
His year-end S&P target of 2,800 is just shy of the median 2,825 forecast of 13 other equity strategists surveyed by CNBC. The forecast 4 percent gain for 2018, though, appears conservative when compared with the market's 20 percent climb this year. 
 The adjustments stem largely from a clearer view of the Republican tax overhaul.
The strategist noted that while he would normally forecast an $8 increase in earnings per share given the bigger-than-expected tax cut, companies may choose to spend that money rather than pass it along. So, he is only adding $5 to his new 2018 earnings per share estimate of $146.
 ""We have noted for various weeks that the strength in the S&P 500 and particularly in domestically-oriented industries' stock prices have reflected the earlier than previously anticipated tax reform developments in D.C.,"" wrote Levkovich. ""Nonetheless, we have become convinced that many companies may use some of the 'found money' from the tax benefit to fund marketing expenses or discounts such that the full bottom-line contribution will not be seen by investors.""
He also offered comment on sectors he believes investors will benefit from most given the Republican tax effort.
""Several industries will be challenged to not pass this along to consumers including Utilities and Retailing versus Railroads and Tobacco that probably hold on to the tax savings,"" he said. ""A few banks also are suggesting that a portion of the money may be used to provide better loan terms to gain or retain market share.""

Attendees walk by a sign for the Saudi Arabian Oil Co.
 Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are poised to take a major role in the sale of a portion of Saudi Arabia's state oil giant, which is expected to be the biggest initial public offering ever, according to multiple reports.
 Saudi Aramco aims to offer investors a 5 percent stake in the company this year. The IPO is central to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's effort to create the world's largest sovereign wealth fund and diversify Saudi Arabia's economy.
Saudi officials have said Aramco could attract a $2 trillion valuation, though others forecast the offering will value the company at $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion. The kingdom aims to raise about $100 billion to underwrite Crown Prince Mohammed's ""Vision 2030"" economic transformation plan.
 It also stands to enrich banks that secure a role in a complicated offering for a sprawling enterprise deeply intertwined with Saudi Arabia's state finances.
The slow pace of progress toward an Aramco IPO has fueled speculation that the sale could be delayed beyond 2018. But on Monday, Bloomberg News reported that Aramco is likely to name Goldman and Citi as lead managers for the offering.
Also on Monday, Reuters reported that the Saudis have invited Goldman and Citi, along with Deutsche Bank, to the kingdom to pitch for a role in the share sale in the coming weeks.
Three other banks that have advised Aramco on the pending share sale — J.P. Morgan Chase, HSBC and Morgan Stanley — are also expected to be global coordinators, according to news reports going back to last year.
Aramco and the banks declined to comment on the Bloomberg and Reuters reports.
In another recent sign that momentum toward an Aramco IPO is picking up steam, the Saudi government on Friday announced it had changed Aramco's status to a joint-stock company, a move that lets the company issue shares.

 Saudi Aramco's massive IPO is 'on track' for next year, CEO says

 Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC in October that the Aramco offering remained on track for 2018, despite reports that the kingdom was considering shelving the IPO in favor of a private share sale to the Chinese government and others.
Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter. It has spearheaded an effort among its fellow OPEC members, Russia and several other oil-producing nations to kill a global glut of crude that has weighed on prices.
An agreement among the nations to cap production has helped boost oil prices above $60 a barrel, a condition industry watchers widely see as necessary for a successful Aramco IPO. The production limits began in January 2017, and the deal is scheduled to remain in place through the end of this year.

 We put a sell on KB Homes after tax bill. Here's why: Citi analyst

 Homeowners in high-tax states on the coasts are going to feel the pinch from the new Republican law overhauling the personal code, according to a Citigroup real estate analyst.
 ""If you live in New York, Connecticut, or California, you're going to get hurt,"" said Will Randow on CNBC's ""Squawk Box""on Thursday. 
On average per household, residents in those states could see their tax bills go up about $3,000, he calculated.
 The reason comes down to a change in the GOP tax law having do to with the so-called SALT provision.
The new approach caps at $10,000 a combination of state and local and taxes including property taxes that filers can deduct from their federal returns.
Previously, there was no limit.
To help mitigate that change, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act almost doubles the standard income tax deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples.
But for many residents in high-tax states, that accommodation won't be enough to keep their tax bills from increasing.
""People in the higher-income groups … can afford the incremental spend,"" Randow said. ""Maybe Christmas is lighter. But I don't think they're going to get hit.""
For others, owning a home might not be the incentive that it used to be in those states, leading to more sellers and lower prices.
The National Association of Realtors is forecasting home prices to be down 10 percent for California, Randow pointed out.
First time homebuyers might also be hesitant due to higher prices, he added.
But on the other side, Evercore ISI analyst Stephen Kim told CNBC last week, ""This is sort of a backdoor way of removing a subsidy for housing that we've seen in this country for almost a century.""
Many experts blame that ""subsidy"" and the lax mortgage lending standards of the past as factors that fueled the housing price bubble that peaked in 2006 and then burst.

 Citigroup earnings top expectations, excluding $19 billion charge for tax law changes   
 8:40  AM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  03:12 
 Citigroup reported quarterly earnings on Tuesday that beat expectations on solid results from consumer banking.
 The big bank also reported a charge of roughly $19 billion following a revamp to the U.S. tax code.
Citigroup reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.28 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Analysts polled by Reuters expected earnings to come in at $1.19. Some analysts have published notes Tuesday morning that put the bank's EPS number closer to $1.20, excluding a tax-related gain.
 Revenue came in roughly in line with expectations at $17.3 billion and was 1 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2016.
Shares rose 1.4 percent in early trading Tuesday.
Citigroup also took at one-time, noncash charge of about $22 billion for the quarter. The company said that approximately $19 billion of the charge is related to recalculating the value of tax assets as a result of the new corporate tax cuts. Another $3 billion of the charge is related to bringing home profit made abroad.
Last month, President Donald Trump signed a bill that slashed the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.
While the new law is expected to be a long-term positive for most companies, several announced they would have to take one-time charges because the lower rate reduced the value of their deferred tax assets, which represent taxes already paid. These companies initially recorded their deferred tax assets at the older, higher rate, so the tax cut made those assets less valuable.
Without the charges related to tax reform, profit for 2017 was $15.8 billion, a 6 percent gain from the prior year.
Revenue for consumer banking rose 6 percent in the fourth quarter, to $8.4 billion, and revenue in investment and corporate banking fell 1 percent, to just over $8 billion. Net credit losses rose 11 percent in the fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier, to $1.9 billion.
Last year Citi doubled its dividend and announced a $15.6 billion share buyback plan, its biggest ever. That is still on track. ""Tax reform does not change our capital return goals as we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital in the current and next two CCAR cycles, subject to regulatory approval,"" CEO Michael Corbat said in a press release on Tuesday. 
""Tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns, but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward,"" he said.

 Cramer still confident on most major banks   
 7:04  PM ET Wed, 17 Jan 2018 |  01:06 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer firmly believes that the financial stocks are the most important leadership group in the market, so he wanted to check in with some of its biggest players after earnings.
 When Cramer told viewers what to look for from the banks' earnings reports last week, he  anticipated the hefty, one-time charges many of them incurred to take advantage of newly enacted tax laws.
""I know it was pure accounting gimmickry, but I worried that it might freak out investors. Turns out there was no need to worry,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup all delivered substantial earnings beats, even as only J.P. Morgan and Citi actually gave you that higher-than-expected revenue that I like to see.""
 For Cramer, the ""headline numbers"" — how the earnings and revenue results compared to analysts' estimates — were less important than the banks' net interest margins, loan growth and capital return plans.
The net interest margin, or the difference between what banks pay individuals for their deposits and the interest they collect on loans, is the primary way banks make money.
Despite concerns of a flattening yield curve, J.P. Morgan's net interest margin rose by 5 basis points from last quarter to 2.42 percent, beating expectations, and Bank of America's increased by 3 basis points to 2.39 percent.
However, Citigroup's net interest margin fell by 9 basis points to 2.63 percent and Wells Fargo's dropped by 2 basis points to 2.84 percent.
As for loan growth, a key line item for gauging the welfare of the economy, the banks also delivered fairly healthy results, Cramer said.
J.P. Morgan's consumer average loan balances rose 1.7 percent versus last quarter, a sign that consumers are warming up to borrowing money, a trend that stimulates economic activity.
Better yet, J.P. Morgan's commercial average loan balances rose by 7 percent, commercial and industrial loans were up 6 percent, and commercial real estate loans increased 9 percent.
Citigroup's total loans were also up 5 percent versus last quarter, which Cramer called ""very good."" Conversely, Bank of America's total loans were up by a meager 1 percent and Wells Fargo's total commercial loans rose by less than 1 percent.
Finally, Cramer turned to the banks' capital return plans, a central topic of discussion amid the Trump administration's easing regulatory regime.
""Now, J.P. Morgan and Citi, and Bank of America all said that their approach to dividends and buybacks won't change because of the tax bill,"" Cramer said. ""But all four of these companies have been voracious buyers of their own stock, especially Bank of America and Wells Fargo, and if the Fed gives them permission to even increase their repurchase programs, I think they'll do just that.""
All things considered, Cramer thought J.P. Morgan reported a solid quarter, with good loan growth, deposit growth, an expanding net interest margin and expectations of a 19 percent tax rate.
But Bank of America delivered what Cramer saw as one of the best quarters in the group, especially with its lack of exposure to the weakness in trading and fixed income revenues — two of J.P. Morgan's weak spots.
""Bank of America is exactly the kind of financial you want to own in this environment,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""They have the most rate sensitivity to rising interest rates because they have such a gigantic deposit base.""
Citigroup's quarter was always going to be marred by its $19 billion one-time charge, but its loan growth was ""encouraging,"" Cramer said.
Wells Fargo was Cramer's only real disappointment. The big bank, still embroiled in reputation repair after its cross-selling scandal, seemed to be struggling to capture new customers, which explained its declining net interest margin numbers and loan balances, he said.
""The company also saw a big pickup in costs thanks to their litigation expenses, and while I think the whole group is poised to go higher here ... I'm going to call [Wells Fargo] my least favorite,"" Cramer added.
As for the stocks themselves, Cramer used tangible book value — what the business would be worth if it was shut down and liquidated — to determine their valuations.
J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo were the most expensive, trading at 2.1 and 2 times book value, respectively. Bank of America was trading at 1.85 times book value, and Citi, the cheapest, came in at 1.28 times book value.
""My view? J.P. Morgan remains best of breed, but as usual, you need to pay up for best of breed. ... If you want the best play on rising interest rates, go for Bank of America, and if you're looking for the value in the group, it's Citi. As for Wells, I think it's going to play catch up to the others because it looks to be out of the woods with the regulators, although I still prefer the others,"" Cramer said. ""The bottom line: after hearing from most of the major banks, I remain confident about the financials as a place to be.""

 Friction is increasing between some credit card companies and customers who want to use the cards to buy cryptocurrencies. 
 Bank of America and Citigroup are reviewing policies that allow customers to buy bitcoin with credit cards. The reviews follow news about two weeks ago that Capital One Financial has decided to prohibit cryptocurrency purchases.

 Toronto-Dominion Bank subsidiary TD Bank also confirmed to CNBC that some bitcoin transactions aren't being processed, as a result of security measures. Discover Financial Services has effectively prohibited cryptocurrency purchases with its credit cards since 2015.
The Wall Street Journal first reported news of Bank of America's cryptocurrency review Thursday. 
Money laundering appears to be a factor in the financial firms' concerns about dealing with cryptocurrencies. Discover CEO David Nelms said in a Bloomberg report Wednesday that financing purchases of cryptocurrencies creates headaches for banks that are required to monitor transactions for money laundering.
Earlier this month, Visa also ended its relationship with cryptocurrency card company WaveCrest, which allows people to convert their cryptocurrencies into cash loaded onto a prepaid card.
J.P. Morgan Chase is still allowing customers to buy cryptocurrencies with their Chase credit cards, the bank told CNBC. Chase did not respond to a question about potential changes to that policy.
