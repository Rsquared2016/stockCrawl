 CRM's Benioff says company 'crushing Oracle'   
 6:57  PM ET Thu, 18 May 2017 |  01:16 
 After Salesforce reported a 2-cent first-quarter earnings beat and raised its guidance by $100 million for fiscal year 2018, Chairman and CEO Marc Benioff said rival cloud plays simply cannot keep up.
 ""You can really see we are crushing Oracle,"" Benioff told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Thursday. ""SAP, Microsoft — it's just across the board. We're getting all these great wins in sales, in service in marketing.""
Benioff pointed to a market share chart from IDC, an independent research firm, showing that Salesforce continues to take business away from its competitors.
 ""Take a look at those numbers. Look at our market share line, Jim, against SAP and Oracle. They're flat to down. We're up exponentially. There's no comparison,"" he told Cramer.
Benioff attributed Salesforce's growth in part to the company's recent acquisitions, which included Demandware, an e-commerce play, Krux, an audience engagement company, and Quip, a productivity suite similar to Microsoft Office.
The CEO said that Demandware, now known as the Salesforce Commerce Cloud, greatly exceeded his expectations for the first quarter in helping retailers find their footing in the cloud.
""Every major retailer in the world is going through a huge transformation from being primarily kind of brick-and-mortar based to going online. And, in some cases, just as you mentioned, they're doing both. They're linking their retail, physical presence, with online. That is really powerful. And we're doing all that through the Salesforce Commerce Cloud,"" he said.
The others, Benioff added, are both amassing a considerable customer base and taking share away from competitors.
""Quip had an incredible deal at 21st Century Fox this quarter where they're replacing Microsoft Office with 20,000 users using Quip. That is an incredible story,"" the CEO said.
All in all, Benioff thanked a number of tailwinds for the company's better-than-expected results, touting the company's recently expanded partnerships with Amazon, Visa, and IBM.
""We're just seeing an amazing set of situations for Salesforce and customer wins, foreign exchange going our way. And also you see it's really the culmination of many great quarters coming together to produce amazing numbers for this quarter,"" Benioff said.
Shares of Salesforce lifted 3 percent in after-hours trading off the company's strong earnings. The stock later slid slightly, but was still up from where it closed.

1,2017-05-24,CNBC Exclusive: Salesforce Chairman & CEO Marc Benioff and Dell Technologies Chairman & CEO Michael Dell on CNBC’s “Closing Bell” Today  Salesforce and Dell announce strategic agreement  ,"WHEN: TODAY, WEDNESDAY, MAY 24
WHERE: CNBC'S ""CLOSING BELL""
 Following is the unofficial transcript of a CNBC EXCLUSIVE interview with Salesforce Chairman & CEO Marc Benioff and Dell Technologies Chairman & CEO Michael Dell on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" today. Following is a link to the interview on CNBC.com:http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000621513.
All references must be sourced to CNBC.
KELLY EVANS: WELCOME BACK. JUST MINUTES AGO SALESFORCE ANNOUNCED A STRATEGIC AGREEMENT WITH DELL TECHNOLOGIES WHERE DELL WILL EXPAND THE USE OF SALESFORCE'S CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT OR CRM PLATFORM. IN A CNBC EXCLUSIVE WE ARE NOW JOINED BY SALESFORCE CEO MARC BENIOFF AND DELL TECHNOLOGIES CEO MICHAEL DELL. WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU. THIS IS A VERY CROSS COUNTRY TYPE OF INTERVIEW HAPPENING HERE. IT IS WONDERFUL AND WE'LL MAKE SURE WE CAN KIND OF KEEP THINGS MOVING AROUND. BUT, MARC, LET ME JUST ASK YOU FIRST WHAT IS SO KEY TO YOU ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT?
MARC BENIOFF: WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, EVERY COMPANY IS GOING THROUGH A DRAMATIC DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION TODAY, BUT I DON'T THINK ANY IS GOING THROUGH A BIGGER TRANSFORMATION THAN DELL. LOOK, THERE'S NO CEO WHO HAS DONE A BETTER JOB OF THAT THAN MICHAEL DELL. HE TOOK HIS COMPANY PRIVATE. NOW HE HAS ACQUIRED EMC. HE HAS CREATED THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SALESFORCE AND DELL.
EVANS: MR. DELL, WHAT WILL THIS ALLOW YOUR CLIENTS TO DO OR YOUR CUSTOMERS TO DO NOW THEY COULDN'T PREVIOUSLY?
MICHAEL DELL: SO, ACROSS DELL TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE ALMOST 40,000 SALES PEOPLE AND ABOUT 200,000 CHANNEL PARTNERS, AND WE'RE ENABLING ALL OF THEM WITH THE SALESFORCE TOOLS AS WE HAVE REALLY FOR OVER A DECADE, AND NOW WITH THE COMBINATION OF DELL AND EMC AND VMWARE AND PIVOTAL AND VIRTUSTREAM AND RSA AND SECUREWORKS AND BOOMI, WE CREATED THIS NEW COMPANY, DELL TECHNOLOGIES AND SALESFORCE IS A FANTASTIC PARTNER.
EVANS: MICHAEL, IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT YOUR ETHOS, THAT THE COMPANY'S ETHOS AT THIS POINT IS VERY MUCH A BET ON THE PRIVATE CLOUD IN CONTRAST TO THE PUBLIC CLOUD SERVICES THAT AMAZON AND GOOGLE OFFER?
DELL: WELL, YOU KNOW, MARC IS BUILDING A CLOUD, YOU KNOW, LARGELY POWERED BY DELL TECHNOLOGIES. WHAT WE SEE IS THE CLOUD IS ACTUALLY NOT A PLACE, BUT RATHER A WAY OF DOING I.T. SO YOU'RE SEEING THIS MULTI-CLOUD WORLD EMERGE WHERE THERE'S CERTAINLY A PUBLIC CLOUD, THERE'S SOFTWARES AND SERVICE, THERE'S MANAGED SERVICE, THERE'S HYBRID CLOUD, ON PREMISE. THERE'S NO QUESTION WE ARE THE LEADER IN INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS. SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE SELLING MORE SERVERS AND MORE STORAGE AND MORE SOFTWARE DEFINED DATA CENTER, MORE VIRTUALIZATION, YOU KNOW, THAN ANYONE ON THE PLANET. THIS CLOUD AS AN OPERATING MODEL IS BEING DEPLOYED BROADLY. MARC IS DOING IT, THE PUBLIC CLOUDS ARE DOING IT, AND NOW YOU'RE SEEING THE SOFTWARE DEFINED DATA CENTER COME INTO LARGE COMPANIES AND EVEN SMALL COMPANIES. WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT'S $25,000, THAT STARTS AT ZERO MONEY DOWN, THAT WE CHARGE MONTHLY FOR. IT IS A CLOUD IN A BOX. SO, AGAIN, WE THINK OF CLOUDS NOT AS A PLACE BUT AS A WAY OF DOING I.T. ONE THAT MARC VERY MUCH PIONEERED.
EVANS: MICHAEL, ALL THE SAME, I DO RECALL YOU TOLD OUR JON FORTT NOT LONG AGO YOU THINK THE PUBLIC CLOUD IN SOME WAYS IS TOO EXPENSIVE. I THINK YOU ACTUALLY SAID YOU COULD SAVE SNAPCHAT SOME MONEY, AND I'M SURE THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES. IS THAT THE CASE? BECAUSE WE ALL KIND OF THINK OF THESE CLOUD SERVICES AS SUCH A CHEAP INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY? BUT ARE COMPANIES FINDING THEY CAN DO IT CHEAPER IN-HOUSE?
DELL: WE ARE SEEING A BOOMERANG AND REPATRIATION EFFECT AS COMPANIES RUN TO THE CLOUD WHAT THEY REALIZE IN THE PUBLIC CLOUD IS THAT NOT ALL WORK LOADS ARE APPROPRIATE. I'M CERTAINLY NOT SAYING THERE IS A ROLL FOR THE PUBLIC CLOUD, THERE IS, BUT IT'S A MULTI-CLOUD WORLD. YOU WILL HAVE SOFTWARES AS SERVICE. WHEN YOU MODERNIZE AND AUTOMATE THE ON PREMISE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PARTICULARLY WITH A SOFTWARE DEFINED DATA CENTER, USING THE LATEST TOOLS THAT WE HAVE, WE'VE HAD MANY CUSTOMERS TELL US THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE OF A PUBLIC CLOUD FOR THE PREDICTABLE PART OF THE WORK LOAD, WHICH FOR MANY CUSTOMERS IS 85-TO-90%. MARC, HIMSELF, AS HE WENT TO GO BUILD OUT HIS CLOUD, HE FOUND THAT WAS LESS EXPENSIVE TO BUY EQUIPMENT FROM US THAN TO PUT IT ALL IN THE PUBLIC CLOUD. AND MANY CUSTOMERS ARE FINDING THE SAME THING.
EVANS: MARC, I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT. JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE PUTTING DELL INSIDE A LOT OF YOUR OFFERINGS. WHY IS THIS A FURTHER STEP? SO TALK – YOU CALL THIS AN AGREEMENT, BUT I DON'T KNOW. YOU ARE WORKING TOGETHER A LOT, MARC. IS THERE MAYBE SOMETHING MORE? IS THIS A BUDDING ROMANCE HERE? A BROMANCE?
BENIOFF: WELL, YEAH, MICHAEL AND I DEFINITELY LOVE EACH OTHER. BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WHAT MICHAEL SAID IS 100% RIGHT, WHICH IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING A COMPANY LIKE SALESFORCE, YOU NEED A LOT OF RELATIONSHIPS TO BUILD A GREAT COMPANY. AND DELL HAS BEEN A CRITICAL, CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP FOR US TO BUILD OUR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE. OF COURSE, WE HAVE A PHENOMENAL RELATIONSHIP WITH AMAZON, WITH AWS. WE HAVE A PHENOMENAL RELATIONSHIP WITH IBM USING SOME OF THEIR CLOUD SERVICES AND WATSON. THAT HAS BEEN AN AI RELATIONSHIP, AN AI ALLIANCE WITH US THAT'S BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOMEBODY LIKE DELL, WHAT'S POWERFUL HERE FOR US IN THE UNITED STATES, WE RUN OUR OWN DATA CENTERS, WE NEED THIS INCREDIBLE CAPABILITY THAT MICHAEL OFFERS. NOT JUST IN COMPUTING, BUT ALSO IN STORAGE AND SO MANY OTHER KEY AREAS, NETWORKING, ON AND ON. IT'S ALL MADE POSSIBLE BY THIS INCREDIBLE COMPANY THAT HE HAS PUT TOGETHER AND THIS IS TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR OUR INDUSTRY. AND THAT IS WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT DELL AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT DELL AND SALESFORCE COMING TOGETHER TO CREATE A DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, NOT JUST FOR DELL BUT ALSO FOR ALL OF OUR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS.
EVANS: MARC, THE INTERESTING THING RIGHT NOW, AND AS MICHAEL HAD PUT IT, SORT OF MOVING INTO A MULTI-CLOUD WORLD, THERE ARE A LOT OF CUSTOMERS WHO JUST WANT A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO PICK FROM. AT THE SAME TIME, AND I FOUND IT KIND OF HILARIOUS THAT CLOUD COMPUTING WON THE PREAKNESS ON SATURDAY, IT DOES FEEL LIKE WE'RE AT THE TOP OF A BIT OF A HYPE CYCLE WHEN IT COMES TO ALL OF THESE OFFERINGS. SO, WHAT SETS THIS – YOU CALLED IT A TRANSFORMATIONAL DEAL – WHAT SETS THIS AGREEMENT APART FROM THE OFFERINGS ALREADY IN PLACE ACROSS THIS INDUSTRY?
BENIOFF: WELL, YOU KNOW, SALESFORCE JUST TURNED 18. AND YOU KNOW THAT THIS YEAR WE'RE PASSING $10.3 BILLION IN REVENUE. WE JUST REPORTED OUR RESULTS LAST QUARTER, GROWING 25% FOR THE QUARTER. AT THIS GROWTH RATE, NO SOFTWARE COMPANY HAS EVER GROWN FASTER. AND WHAT MADE THAT POSSIBLE IS CLOUD COMPUTING. NOT THE HORSE. BUT THE IDEA THAT COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO BUY THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AND CAPABILITIES TO GET GOING QUICKLY. THE REALITY IS MICHAEL HAS A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY INFRONT OF HIM TO HELP SO MANY COMPANIES, NOT JUST OURS, BUT SO MANY COMPANIES BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT THAT MEANS HIS SALES, HIS SERVICE, HIS MARKETING NEEDS TO BE DEPLOYED RIGHT NOW AND HE NEEDS TO CREATE CUSTOMER SUCCESS RIGHT NOW. WE ARE GOING TO HELP HIM DO THAT.
EVANS: UNDERSTOOD. THIS WASN'T EASY TO PULL OFF THIS KIND OF – YOU KNOW, WE HAVE CALIFORNIA, WE HAVE TEXAS, WE HAVE NEW YORK. GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US TODAY. MARC BENIOFF AND MICHAEL BELL.

2,2017-06-01,Silicon Valley urges Trump not to reject the Paris climate agreement  ,"Drew Angerer | Getty Images 
(L to R) Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon, Larry Page, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc. (parent company of Google), Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, Vice President-elect Mike Pence listen as President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a meeting at Trump Tower, December 14, 2016 in New York City.
 Silicon Valley has been vocal about its opposition to the U.S. abandoning the Paris climate accord, a global agreement to reduce carbon emissions.
 Now, as the Trump administration threatens to withdraw the U.S. from the deal, many tech executives, including executives at Tesla, HPE and Salesforce, are urging President Donald Trump to keep the U.S. in the agreement.
Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, recently threatened to leave White House advisory councils if Trump drops the Paris accord. 
 Musk tweet: Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case
 Musk is on Trump's manufacturing jobs council, his strategic and policy forum, and his infrastructure council. 
More than two dozen CEOs signed a letter that appeared in full-page ads Thursday in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Among the signatories was Salesforce's Marc Benioff, who also took to Twitter.
 Benioff tweet: Dear President Trump, as some of the largest companies in the US, we strongly urge you to keep the US in the Paris Agreement.
 Hewlett Packard CEO, Meg Whitman told CNBC that leaving the Paris climate agreement would put the U.S. behind in jobs in the future. ""Please do not withdraw from the Paris climate accord, this is not in the best interest of Americans,"" Whitman said on ""Squawk on the Street."" 
The president is scheduled to announce at 3 p.m. Thursday.

3,2017-06-15,Slack is raising another $500 million — and has attracted interest from a range of big buyers like Amazon  ,"Chris Goodney | Bloomberg | Getty Images 
Stewart Butterfield, co-founder and chief executive officer of Slack Technologies
 Slack, the popular business communications company, is in the midst of raising $500 million at a $5 billion post-money valuation, an effort that has also attracted several potential buyers interested in taking out the company ahead of the funding.
Those include Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Salesforce, several of which have previously shown interest in acquiring Slack.  Bloomberg reported the interest by Amazon yesterday, with a $9 billion sales price.
That's obviously an enormous amount of money, even though Slack CEO and founder Stewart Butterfield has long said publicly — and privately — that he wanted to keep the San Francisco startup independent.
 Often when a hot company in Silicon Valley is seeking funding, larger players like to make an approach before it is done, since it gives the startup more options.
While there have been no formal offers, said sources, all those companies have long been eyeing Slack, which has transformed the enterprise business with its quirky approach to business communications. For those not familiar, imagine Facebook for the office and you are down the right alley.
Slack has tried hard to attract a wider range of corporate customers, who are wary of new products due to security and privacy concerns. In addition, it has also been pushing to create a larger platform developer system to make the service more robust.

The company currently has $1 billion in revenue, sources said, with its existing customers, although it is not profitable yet. Still, it is impressive for a company which started out as a gaming company and pivoted when that effort failed.
But Slack faces enormous challenges including from a range of bigger rivals like Microsoft, who are developing similar products and have more access to markets. Slack also lacks the management depth that such competition will require.
But it is also a compelling and fast-growing business for many companies and fits in well with their businesses, such as Microsoft's Azure, Google's business offerings and Amazon Web Services.
But, as I noted, Butterfield has long wanted to build his own big company and adding an enormous funding round would allow Slack some breathing room to get to cash flow positive.
Slack declined to comment.

 Uber will not be the last crisis of equality in the tech industry: Salesforce CEO   
 5:47  AM ET Tue, 27 June 2017 |  02:07 
 Uber's tumultuous six months of scandal is likely to mark the first of many equality crises in the tech industry, according to Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff.
 Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Dalian, China, Benioff warned that tech giants would need to take their capabilities to another level in order to avoid the chaos which rocked Uber.
Travis Kalanick, the former chief executive at the transportation colossus, resigned from his position last week in the face of pressure from Uber's five largest investors.
 ""I think because equality is more dominant in our industry than ever before, you saw that when (Kalanick's) employees started to write a very strong narrative about how that was not valued inside that leadership team… It became a crisis of equality,"" Benioff told CNBC on Tuesday.
""That will not be the last crisis of equality that you will see in the tech industry. I think it's just one at the beginning of several,"" he added.
 'Our industry wants to see more equality'
 Frank Muldoon | CNBC
Marc Benioff
 Kalanick stepped down as Uber CEO on June 20. The New York Times reported several board members demanded Kalanick leave the company after a string of sexual harassment and discrimination allegations against the company's leadership surfaced.
In February, Susan Fowler – a former Uber employee – published an account alleging sexual harassment and gender bias during her time at the company.
The account, titled ""Reflecting on one very, very strange year at Uber"" claimed there were multiple instances where managers and human resources representatives acted poorly.
""When Ms Fowler started to talk about what was going on at Uber, that just amplified I think that many people in our industry and I think in other industries want to see more equality,"" Benioff concluded.

 Some FAANGS are still undervalued: Salesforce CEO   
 5:28  AM ET Tue, 27 June 2017 |  02:50 
 Salesforce Chief Executive Marc Benioff told CNBC on Tuesday that despite an unprecedented rally among high-growth technology giants, some FANG stocks still remain undervalued.
 The so-called FANG technology stocks refer to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (through parent company Alphabet). Some investors also recognize Apple as an additional 'A' to the FANG acronym.""I think some of those FANGs are still undervalued, I would agree with Jim Cramer,"" Benioff said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Dalian, China.
Cramer, CNBC's ""Mad Money"" host, suggested last week that FANG's seemingly relentless run higher would most likely be led by Amazon during this ""very broad growth rally"".
 ""You look at Amazon Web Services (AWS) business going past $20 billion this year and I think it is on a trajectory to go to $100 billion,"" Benioff said.
The Salesforce CEO said his company enjoyed a close working relationship with Amazon and predicted the Seattle-based firm would have a ""tremendous upside"" with Chief Executive Jeff Bezos at the helm.
 FANG rally could be a 'bearish signal'
 Adam Jeffery | CNBC 
FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) apps on a smartphone.
 Meanwhile, on Saturday, the man often hailed as the original ""Dr. Doom"" pointed to the meteoric rise of FANG stocks as a glaringly bearish signal for the U.S. stock market.
Marc Faber, the editor of ""The Gloom, Boom & Doom Report"" and a perennial bear, predicted the stocks could soon be sent plummeting by 40 percent or more.
""You know we have a lot of volatility, and when things will start to go down, they'll go down a lot,"" he said.Faber is deeply concerned that wealth has flowed to big corporations and affluent people. He believes the imbalance could eventually disrupt the markets as we know it.

 Salesforce stock has potential to double: Josh Spencer   
 12:44  PM ET Tue, 27 June 2017 |  04:06 
 Salesforce's stock has a lot of runway ahead of it and could easily double within the next three years, tech fund manager Josh Spencer told CNBC on Tuesday.
 ""This is the biggest position in my fund. It's close to 15 percent of the fund right now, and I think it's got a lot of upside over the next several years,"" the manager of the T. Rowe Price Global Technology Fund said on ""Halftime Report.""
The company has ""fantastic top-line growth, a great management team, really well-positioned across cloud software with a number of different clouds that they offer and they've just put up the numbers for so long,"" he added.
 Spencer spoke a day after SunTrust Robinson Humphrey initiated coverage of the company with a buy rating and a price target of $110. SunTrust said investors should buy Salesforce stock in part because it believes the company ""can sustain 20-percent-plus top-line growth.""
Terry Tillman, an equity research analyst at SunTrust, said in a note to clients that Salesforce's service, market and commerce clouds could fuel that overall growth.
Salesforce stock was up about modestly midafternoon Tuesday, and has risen more than 26 percent over the past six months, according to FactSet.
Regarding other tech stocks, Spencer said he has hopped out of FANG stocks Facebook and Apple, saying most FANG stocks are fully valued, but not overvalued. 
FANG refers to Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google's Alphabet. Some investors also recognize Apple as an additional ""A"" in the FANG acronym.
""I probably have the highest-weight software sector that I've had since I've managed the fund ... and I have less in the internet sector,"" he said.

5,2017-06-28,"Salesforce's embrace of AI was sparked by an edict from Marc Benioff, co-founder says  ","Salesforce cofounder Parker Harris, right, with CEO Marc Benioff at Salesforce's 2015 Dreamforce conference.
 Artificial intelligence is reshaping Salesforce in the same way that mobile and social did in years past.
 The company thrived in the transition to mobile computing with custom apps for smartphones and succeeded in social with messaging service Chatter as well as tools for tracking internet ads. Now, Salesforce is embracing AI to automate sales leads and make customer service smarter.
On Wednesday,  Salesforce introduced new AI services that third-party developers can weave into their applications.
 How did this internal trend start?
Marc Benioff, Salesforce's CEO, issued an edict of sorts a couple years ago telling his staff that ""everything needs to be powered by AI,"" said Parker Harris, the company's co-founder and product strategy chief, in an interview with CNBC.
""He said, 'You know what -- we need to have AI in all of our clouds,'"" Harris said.
Historically, Benioff has played the role of idea guy at the cloud software company, while the work of implementing ideas has fallen to Harris.
With AI, Salesforce engineers were doing some testing, but the efforts were propelled forward through a flurry of deals. The company acquired BeyondCore, Implisit Insights, MinHash, PredictionIO and most importantly MetaMind. Recent acquisitions Demandware and Krux also had some AI projects in the works, Harris said.

 Uber will not be the last crisis of equality in the tech industry: Salesforce CEO   
 5:47  AM ET Tue, 27 June 2017 |  02:07 
 Salesforce has to keep pace with other big technology firms that are also investing heavily in AI and is paying up for acquisitions and individual hires. 
Harris, meanwhile, has been busy injecting AI into Salesforce's services in accord with Benioff's directive, which came in early 2015 by his recollection. For example, the company is applying AI to its core business of tracking customer relationships and other areas like customer service interactions and marketing.
""It wouldn't have worked if we had said, 'Let's build the brain for Salesforce and then start to apply it to each of the areas,'"" Harris said. 
At the same time, Salesforce also wants to provide core services that other applications can use. The new tools for app developers allow third parties to pick up on sentiment and intent in text and recognize objects in images through Salesforce's Einstein portfolio.
Salesforce is also getting some help from another big player in AI. In March the company announced a partnership with IBM to have Watson contribute relevant information to Salesforce's clouds.
""It's pretty cool that we're able to leverage all that AI and add it to our AI,"" Harris said.

6,2017-07-11,Cramer's charts show 3 cloud stocks shooting for the stars  3 cloud stocks shooting for the stars  Cramer's charts show 3 cloud stocks shooting for the stars  ,"As investors shy away from the technology sector for fear that parts of it are overvalued, Jim Cramer wanted to make the case for three cloud stocks that he believes have more room to run.
 ""In the last few weeks, stocks of cloud kingpins like Salesforce.com, Workday [and] Red Hat have all pulled back from their highs,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The problem with the cloud is very simple: a lot of investors don't understand it because it's fundamentally about the enterprise, companies, not about the consumer, you.""
Cramer argued that because most people do not interact with the work these companies do on a daily basis, they tend to mistrust their success. In reality, these giants help even bigger names like Amazon and Netflix save fortunes on hardware, cut overhead and streamline operations.
 But rather than explaining these cloud players' fundamentals, Cramer turned to the charts of technician Bob Lang, the founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and Cramer's colleague at TheStreet.com who helps run its Trifecta Stocks newsletter.
""While Salesforce, Workday and Red Hat have all had a very strong year, in the last five-odd weeks they've been hit with a wave of selling,"" Cramer said. ""However, they're now beginning to bounce back, and Lang believes that all three could be ready to resume their runs higher after some modest pullbacks.""
The ""Mad Money"" host started with the daily chart of one of his long-time favorites, Salesforce.
 After a healthy run earlier this year, shares of Salesforce took a hit in June, falling 8 percent before finding a floor of support at the stock's 50-day moving average, a technical indicator that smooths out a stock's random price fluctuations over a given time.
Salesforce's stock is still up nearly 30 percent year to date despite the pullback, and Lang noticed that the moving average convergence/divergence, or MACD, indicator, which helps technicians predict when a stock could change direction, made a bullish crossover.
That crossover, shown above by the black line crossing over the red line, is one of the most reliable ""buy"" signals in all of technical analysis, Cramer said.
Since Salesforce has shown signs of recovery since its pullback, including a bottoming ""W"" pattern that suggests the stock could go higher from here, Lang felt strongly about its trajectory.
""If Salesforce.com can rally less than two bucks from here to $90, then the W will have been confirmed, and from that level, Lang believes it could be an easy run to the mid-$90s or even past $100,"" Cramer said. ""In short, Salesforce's chart has a lot going for it. It's Lang's favorite name in the group.""
Shares of Workday, a cloud-based software provider that helps companies become more efficient by automating back-office functions like billing and expense tracking, also pulled back considerably in June.
 While indicators show that buying has slowed for the stock, Lang's daily chart for Workday showed that the stock's June decline went hand-in-hand with a decline in trading volume.
Lower volume indicates there were not many sellers, and if big institutions cannot bring themselves to sell Workday's stock when it is weak, Cramer said it could be stronger than it seems.
""Now, Lang believes that Workday is getting ready to make a run for its old highs. If the stock can climb less than a buck, climbing back over $100, then Lang thinks it could be smooth sailing to $105 in the not-too-distant future,"" Cramer said.
Finally, Cramer turned to the daily chart of another one of his favorites, open-source software company Red Hat.
 After Red Hat reported a much better-than-expected quarter and sprung to all-time highs in June, the stock tapered slightly and sold off some of its gains, a typical post-earnings pattern for the cloud provider.
Like Workday, the pullback happened on low volume, and Lang noticed the MACD indicator approaching the same kind of bullish crossover it made in Salesforce's chart.
""Plus, the upward slope of the Relative Strength Index, the RSI, an important momentum indicator, is very steep, which Lang tells us means this can continue to perform much better than the rest of the market,"" Cramer said. ""Put it all together, and Lang says that Red Hat really just needs to rally less than three dollars from here, to $100, at which point he expects the stock to roar higher before temporarily running out of steam at the $110 area.""
All in all, as much of the market shirks the cloud stocks due to concerns about how they are really performing, Lang's indicators show that in reality, they may just be getting started.
""Here's the bottom line: the cloud companies have some of the best growth rates around, and their charts, as interpreted by Bob Lang, suggest that stocks like Salesforce, Workday and Red Hat could be ready to roar once again after a nice pullback just last month,"" Cramer said.

7,2017-08-02,Salesforce's second-largest business just hired its fourth new leader in four years as growth slows  ,"Mark Neuling | CNBC 
Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.
 Salesforce has made the fourth leadership change in four years to its second-largest business, Service Cloud, as it struggles to meet revenue goals. The company has also effectively shut down a similar product for smaller businesses, Desk.com, according to sources.
 Bill Patterson, a 14-year Microsoft veteran who was most recently on the Dynamics team, has joined Service Cloud as its senior vice president and product management leader. He reports to Mike Rosenbaum, Salesforce's executive vice president of customer relationship management applications. Last week Patterson updated his LinkedIn profile to acknowledge his new job. MSDynamicsWorld was first to report the move. 
Service Cloud, a piece of software that customer-service representatives can use to manage inquiries, has been one of Salesforce's main growth drivers in recent years, going from $1.3 billion in sales in 2014 to $2.3 billion in 2016. But despite its growth, Service Cloud has dealt with frequent leadership turnover and a failure to reach its revenue goals in the past several years.
 Patterson is the fourth product leader in the past four years, and the seventh since Service Cloud's launch in 2009. Most recently, the position was held by Adam Blitzer, an executive VP who had been running both the Sales Cloud and Service Cloud teams since December. Patterson's hiring was in part aimed at alleviating some of the pressure Blitzer had felt, as he was managing two products that accounted for 75 percent of Salesforce's total revenue, according to the person. Now Blitzer is solely focusing on Sales Cloud.
""It's a dynamic industry, and things happen,"" Rosenbaum, a 12-year Salesforce veteran, told CNBC. In appointing Patterson, the idea is to assemble a ""better team"" that can take Service Cloud business to the next level, Rosenbaum said.
Although Service Cloud still accounts for 30 percent of Salesforce's revenue, the business' growth has slowed, going from 37.6 percent in year-over-year revenue growth in 2015 to 27.6 percent in 2016, according to Salesforce's most recent annual report. And Service Cloud has failed to reach its revenue goals for the past two years, a source said. (Rosenbaum wouldn't comment on that but did emphasize that IDC says Salesforce leads the customer service and support software market, ahead of Oracle and SAP, among others.)
The Service Cloud group has struggled when it comes to selling to small and medium-sized businesses, two people said. To go after smaller businesses, Salesforce acquired Assistly for around $50 million in 2011 and re-launched it under the Desk.com brand in early 2012.
One of the Desk.com team's assignments, a second source said, was to siphon business away from then-private Zendesk, which has grown into a $3 billion public company. Salesforce even tried to buy Zendesk, but when the effort faltered, the company went after Assistly, the second source said.
Desk.com amounted to a second customer-service tool that cost less money than Service Cloud. Some executives opposed it because it pulled down sales numbers for the bigger Service Cloud business that Desk.com is part of, while some salespeople preferred not to sell it because it left them with less compensation for the deals they landed, the second source said.
Rosenbaum challenged that assertion, saying that salespeople don't decide which types of customer service products to sell -- different sales teams go after different types of companies, he said.
At one point Salesforce had around 200 people working on Desk.com, the source said. But the company hasn't sought attention for a Desk.com product update for 17 months, and it's effectively not actively developing it anymore, according to two people. Salesforce says Asana, Bonobos and Coinbase are among the companies that use Desk.com; Rosenbaum said the company is committed to supporting the customers who still use the tool. The company's experience running Desk.com has influenced the development of its Service Cloud Lightning tool, which is suited for companies of any size, Rosenbaum said.
Patterson is the latest Microsoft executive to jump ship to Salesforce, representing a new development in the on-and-off relationship between the two longtime rivals. Last year, Salesforce brought in Tony Prophet, a marketing exec, as its first chief equality officer. Previously, it brought in Bob Stutz, former Microsoft Dynamics' head of business, and Randy Kern, an executive from Microsoft's Azure cloud business.

 Salesforce is strategically favorable: Pivotal Research's Brian Wieser   
 7:29  PM ET Tue, 22 Aug 2017 |  02:03 
 Salesforce reported its second quarter earnings on Tuesday after the bell, and the numbers came in above estimates.
 Here are the most important numbers:
 Adjusted EPS: 33 cents vs. 32 cents per share expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Revenue: $2.56 billion vs. $2.51 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate 
 Despite the overall beat, Salesforce's stock dropped almost 3 percent before trading roughly flat in after hours. Salesforce's stock enjoyed a surprise 6 percent jump over the past couple weeks in the run up to Tuesday's earnings, and is up over 30 percent this year.
After going on a record buying spree in 2016, Salesforce has slowed its pace of acquisition this year, with only one deal announced so far. Instead, the business software maker has focused on generating growth from its prior deals, especially in the artificial intelligence market.
Salesforce's revenue saw a 26 percent jump from a year-ago period, while its deferred revenue, an important metric that reflects its future growth, grew 26 percent year-over-year as well, to $4.82 billion. Unbilled deferred revenue, the portion of contracts that have not been billed yet and off the balance sheet,  also grew 30 percent from last year to $10.4 billion.
 ""We have $15B in on and off the balance sheet deferred revenue. That is the predictor of our future revenue growth. That's revenue that we have signed but not yet recognized. Incredible numbers,"" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in an interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer.
The company's third quarter revenue is expected to be in the range of $2.64 billion to $2.65 billion, which exceeds street estimates of $2.61 billion. 
Salesforce raised its full year guidance by $100 million to the range of $10.35 billion to $10.40 billion. That would make it the first year for Salesforce to cross the $10 billion annual revenue mark.
""We did this faster than any other enterprise software company in history,"" Benioff said in a statement.
Still, competition is increasing from companies like Microsoft, Oracle, and ServiceNow. Salesforce's Service Cloud, its second-largest business, has struggled to reach its internal goals of late, leading to four leadership changes in four years.

 CRM's Benioff on push into AI   
 6:50  PM ET Tue, 22 Aug 2017 |  00:55 
 Shares of Salesforce may have ticked down after the company's earnings beat, but CEO Marc Benioff was entirely forward-looking when he discussed his cloud giant's prospects with CNBC.
 ""We're really seeing this incredible new capability that's driving so much growth in enterprise software, artificial intelligence, and Salesforce is the first to deliver artificial intelligence in all of our products that are helping our customers do machine learning and machine intelligence and deep learning using Einstein,"" Benioff told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Tuesday.
Einstein, Salesforce's A.I. platform, was rolled out in 2016 as the company turned its focus to cutting-edge developments in the world of software, Benioff said.
 ""I think everybody understands how important the cloud is. It's the single most transformative technology in enterprise software today. I think everybody understands mobility because everybody's got a cellphone and lots of apps and seen how they've moved off of PCs and onto mobility,"" Benioff said. ""Einstein is Salesforce's AI platform that is really the next generation of Salesforce's products and it's in the hands of all of our customers right now and making a huge difference. It makes them have the ability to make much smarter decisions about their business each and every day.""
On top of its earnings beat, Salesforce hit an annual revenue run-rate, or future revenue forecast, of over $10 billion faster than any other enterprise software company, ever.
Benioff touted the software giant's 24 percent revenue growth forecast, attributing it in part to the rapid growth in the customer relationship management market.
""The forecasts are that the CRM market is going to $1 trillion,"" Benioff told Cramer. ""The CRM market has gone from being an also-ran market in enterprise software to the largest and most important market in enterprise software. It used to be operating systems, it used to be databases, it used to be other things in enterprise software. Now it's all about CRM and we are No. 1 in the fastest growing segment in enterprise software. That is growing our revenue so dramatically.""
Salesforce's earnings were also driven by an array of new clients including luxury fashion brand Louis Vuitton and the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.
Benioff said Salesforce helped Louis Vuitton produce a tech-enabled watch tied to an app connected with Salesforce.
But Salesforce's biggest new client, one of the largest auto manufacturers in the world, asked the cloud company not to publicly name them.
""[They] signed a wall-to-wall agreement with us in sales, in service, in marketing, in commerce, in all these areas,"" Benioff said. ""Very exciting.""
The Department of Veterans Affairs, on the other hand, commissioned Salesforce to create an assortment of high-quality systems to help veterans connect to their customers.
When Cramer asked Benioff how he felt working for President Donald Trump's administration in light of recent controversy, the Salesforce chief offered a measured response.
""I've worked with three administrations, and I have a set of core values,"" Benioff said. ""One of them [is] equality. Another one is love. And the things that are important to me don't change. Administrations change.""
The CEO said that when Trump asked him for advice, Benioff told him to focus on apprenticeships given the rise of artificial intelligence and, following that, job displacement.
""We need to make sure we do more job retraining, and that's why we're working to have a 5 million apprenticeship dream,"" Benioff told Cramer. ""But for the CEOs who call me and say, 'What should I do? Should I resign? Should I stay? Should I go?' I don't really know what to tell them, because I didn't join any of the councils because I really learned a long time ago the best thing I can do is just give my best advice. And the best way that I can give my best advice is not to be encumbered with any job with any administration.""

 Salesforce has struck a number of partnership deals with Amazon Web Services over the past year, suddenly becoming a close ally of Amazon's cloud arm.
 That relationship is starting to bear fruit, Salesforce says, as it's helping solve one glaring weakness in the cloud software maker's business: overseas sales.
Salesforce said during its earnings call on Tuesday that its partnership with AWS has helped open up new opportunities in countries like Canada and Australia. Salesforce started running its software in AWS data centers in Canada last month, and is planning to do so in Australia later this year. 
 The offering is aimed at targeting companies that may feel uncomfortable storing their data in data centers outside their region. For example, a lot of government agencies and financial services firms are still sensitive about using data centers that are not located in their own country.
Salesforce has previously run its software in data centers it owns. But last year, it announced it would use AWS to run some of its software after committing to spend $400 million over four years on Amazon's cloud platform, which has a wider footprint in more geographic regions.
Salesforce said it signed up companies like Nomura, Queensland Urban Utilities, and Australia Post last quarter.
""With AWS, that relationship is strong and that just gives us a lot of flexibility as we continue to focus and expand internationally,"" Salesforce president and COO Keith Block said during the call.
Growing international sales is important for Salesforce. The company still gets over 70% of its sales from the North American region — with the US market accounting for over 90% of the share — and the growth rates of overseas sales have been stagnant, hovering at around 30% annually.
In the 2nd quarter, Europe accounted for 18 percent of total revenue, while the Asia Pacific market accounted for 10 percent of the total. That's a small share compared to Microsoft or Oracle who drive almost half of their revenue from overseas markets, according to FactSet.
Block said Salesforce will continue to make ""significant investments"" in overseas markets as it presents a lot of new upside. In fact, more than 40 percent of all new hires have come from outside of the US, he said.
""Our international growth continues to represent a huge opportunity for Salesforce,"" Block said.

15,2017-11-01,Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff reminds employees of workplace drinking ban: 'Alcohol is a drug'  ,"David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com speaks during the DreamForce Conference in San Francisco, Oct. 5, 2016.
 Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff left a strong message for his 25,000 employees last month after seeing alcoholic drinks and kegs sitting in the office: take them out.
 ""I want to remind everyone that we have a no alcohol policy at Salesforce,"" Benioff wrote in an internal blog post seen by CNBC. ""Alcohol is a drug and having alcohol on a Salesforce premise is simply unfair to the Ohana who either do not want it or are intolerant of it.""
Benioff, who often calls his employees ""Ohana,"" the Hawaiian word for family, isn't the only public company CEO to enforce a no-drinking policy at work. But he's certainly one of the first tech CEOs to put a hard ban on workplace drinking — a trendy office perk in Silicon Valley that has almost become the norm among tech companies as they try to attract talent with a more laid-back office culture.
 Office booze has gained popularity, particularly among tech startups run by young CEOs, as it helps avoid an old, stodgy company image and is believed to encourage an environment where employees enjoy their time together.
Companies such as Twitter and Glassdoor have multiple kegs of beer available free of charge to employees at any time. Yelp and GitHub have free booze but only allow access after work or in certain parts of the office. Facebook and Google don't have an official ban on alcohol, but employees are expected to use common sense when it comes to drinking.
But a growing number of tech companies are starting to kick alcohol out of the office entirely.
Start-up Zenefits banned office drinking last year as part of its effort to clean up its party-like work culture. Uber is considering instituting a similar ban during ""core working hours"" and reducing the budget for drinks during after-hour events, based on recommendations by an outside law firm. Jet.com has gotten stricter about enforcing a no-booze rule after getting acquired by Wal-Mart, which doesn't allow office drinking, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Salesforce officially announced an alcohol ban at an all-hands meeting held more than a year ago, another person said. It's unclear what inspired the change, but Benioff shared his thoughts about it on Twitter last year, when he wrote, ""No room for alcohol or drugs in a start up or tech culture. The CEO has to set the tone from the top and enforce.""
 There are plenty of reasons for companies to think twice about allowing alcohol in the office. Free booze is an added expense for the company. Workplace drinking increases the likelihood of bad behavior, such as sexual harassment, which has become a growing problem in the tech industry. And, as Benioff points out, those who can't tolerate alcohol likely don't want to be exposed to it.
But the biggest risk lies in the potential liability issues that follow, according to Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the Wharton School. If an employee gets into trouble, such as a car accident, after drinking alcohol provided by the employer, the company could be legally liable, he said.
""Employers are rightly concerned about legal liability for actions that their employees take either at work or after hours when they have been drinking alcohol provided by the employer,"" Cappelli said. ""If I'm injured by a drunk employee, I'm likely to sue their employer because the employer has more money.""
Still, not everyone's happy with Salesforce's decision to ban office drinking. Some Salesforce employees aired their frustration on Blind, an anonymous chat app that requires users to have a working company email in order to post about their employer. 
In a message in a public forum seen by CNBC, one person wrote that office drinking should be a choice and shouldn't be considered an inclusivity issue because no one's forcing others to drink.
""It's not as if drinking was mandatory by any means,"" the person wrote. ""It seems like excluding something optional under the guise of inclusivity doesn't make any sense logically.""

 CRM's deeper tie-up with Google   
 7:11  PM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  01:04 
 Salesforce.com and Alphabet's Google are teaming up to help their customers be more productive, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told CNBC on Monday.
 ""You look to Google, you see this incredible world of information, you see the advertising but you also get Google Analytics,"" Benioff told CNBC's Jim Cramer in an exclusive interview on ""Mad Money.""
""And Google Analytics coupled with Salesforce's sales and service and marketing means that both of our customers are going to have customer insights that they've never had before. That is really exciting.""
 The partnership will combine Salesforce's customer relations management technology with Google's G Suite, a series of business-friendly apps designed to stoke collaboration and productivity. The Google product competes primarily against Microsoft Office 365.
Google will also offer a company-wide promotion to give free G Suite licenses for up to one year to all Salesforce customers that are new to G Suite.
The deal will also connect Salesforce with Google Analytics, allowing joint customers to merge sales, marketing and advertising data stored in both systems.
Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president of ads and commerce, told Cramer that this component will help give their marketing clients a broader view of consumer activity, online and offline.
""This partnership addresses the No. 1 request that we have from our customers,"" Ramaswamy said. ""Our customers want a holistic view, a total view across Salesforce's CRM systems and Analytics, where all the website action takes place. This is really a first-of-its-kind integration.""
Today's news includes an expansion of the existing partnership between the Google Cloud Platform and Salesforce, which also has existing partnerships with Amazon Web Services and Cisco Systems, among other tech titans.
In the same interview, Google Cloud Senior Vice President Diane Greene said that partnering with a company that offers software-as-a-service on such a massive scale could move the needle for Google.
""I dream of being No. 1. I think it's possible,"" she told Cramer. ""We're making unbelievable progress and I think having one of the world's largest SaaS vendors running on our core services on our Cloud really underscores just how enterprise-ready we are.""
In May 2014, Salesforce announced it would enter a strategic partnership with Microsoft to create a similar linkage between Salesforce's CRM system and Microsoft Office and Windows.
Soon after, reports emerged of a potential acquisition of Salesforce by Microsoft, but deal talks ended when the companies couldn't agree on a price.
Since then, the two companies' relations have fizzled. Tensions rose to a high when Microsoft outbid Salesforce for professional social network LinkedIn in 2015.
In November 2016, Benioff commented on the fallout, saying that ""the new Microsoft"" under CEO Satya Nadella was much like the ""old Microsoft"" under Steve Ballmer, who was notoriously averse to corporate partnerships.

 CRM's Benioff: How we're getting around the 'loyalty is dead' problem   
 6:57  PM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  01:16 
 Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff told CNBC on Monday that consumer ""loyalty is dead.""
 ""Loyalty is dead. It is,"" Benioff told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer. ""Because it's all about your community. Isn't that how you buy anyway, from your friends? Don't you want to join a community and be a part of a community?""
Speaking from Dreamforce, Salesforce's annual technological convention, Benioff said that Salesforce clients like Marriott International are realizing how hard it is to retain their customers.
 ""They realize loyalty is dead,"" Benioff said, adding that Marriott has found a way to engage consumers in new ways, like offering room keys that download straight to their smartphones.
""They want to have this huge community of hundreds of millions of consumers map out where they are on their journeys and get all those consumers into those Marriott hotels,"" the CEO continued. ""Walk in, have a great experience, have your key right on your phone, and welcome back to Marriott. That's a customer experience.""
News corporations like 21st Century Fox, a Salesforce client, are feeling the lack of loyalty as cord-cutters quash cable news subscription numbers.
On Monday, reports surfaced that Fox was in talks to sell most of its assets to Disney in order to concentrate its focus on news and sports.
""What part of media doesn't need to connect with their customers more smartly?"" Benioff said. ""And you can do it today with data.""
And data, particularly consumer data, is the key to customer retention in in the 21st century, the CEO said.
""Your greatest opportunity for your customer is your last customer. And that's the reality,"" Benioff told Cramer. ""You want to have a community and all of your customers are on a journey with you. You could be on a retention journey with your customer. You could be on a get back into our business journey. You could just be on a renewal journey. You've got to map those journeys out.""
As the world enters what Benioff and Dreamforce are calling ""the fourth industrial revolution"" — the rise of artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, quantum computing and other innovations — community is exactly what industries must strive to preserve, Benioff said,
""The question is, what are we going to do with all of these technologies? And look, there's a threat here, which is: Is it creating more inequality? Is it dividing us? Well, in some cases, it is,"" the CEO said. ""Is it disconnecting us, or are we going to use this technology to raise ourselves up and create more equality, be more connected, be more united? And that's why people are at Dreamforce. They're here to come together and to get empowered.""

 Salesforce stock rose 2.5 percent after hours on Monday after the company disclosed guidance for its 2019 fiscal year for the first time. The guidance suggests the company could post revenue growth of up to 20 percent.
 In a statement the company said it would bring in $12.45 billion to $12.5 billion in revenue for the fiscal year, which will end on Jan. 31, 2019. According to FactSet, analysts estimated an average of $12.46 billion in revenue for the period, which falls at the lower end of the guidance range.
In August the company estimated it would bring in $10.35 billion to 10.4 billion in revenue for the full 2018 fiscal year, which would be up 23-24 percent year over year. The high end of the guidance for the 2019 fiscal year implies a 20 percent revenue increase.
 And the actual revenue may be higher, based on past performance. ""For the revenue target, as is customary for the company, we think initial forecast will likely prove to be conservative as management is likely to walk the numbers higher,"" Mizuho analysts Abhey Lamba and Parthiv Varadarajan wrote in a note. 
Also on Monday Salesforce announced a partnership with Google that touches on using Google public cloud infrastructure and integrating with Google cloud applications.
Salesforce is set to hold its annual investor day at its Dreamforce conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. The company reports earnings for the third quarter of its 2018 fiscal year on Nov. 21.

From left, Salesforce intern Jiatao Gu, chief scientist Richard Socher and research scientist James Bradbury.
 Salesforce on Tuesday revealed its latest progress around ways to translate text from one language into another without human input.
The translation system comes close to being the most accurate there is today by one measurement, and the researchers have ideas about how to improve it.
 ""We want to see it deployed in a lot of places,"" Salesforce chief scientist Richard Socher told CNBC in an interview at the company's Salesforce IQ office in Palo Alto, California.
In recent years, web companies like Facebook and Google have been the ones leading the way in terms of incorporating artificial intelligence into their products. Now Salesforce is among the companies drawing on AI to improve the software that people at big companies use. That could help Salesforce as it competes with the likes of IBM, Microsoft and Oracle.
Salesforce established its AI research lab following its 2016 acquisition of Socher's start-up, MetaMind. The group has doubled in size since then, Socher said. Like many other corporate research organizations, Salesforce Research regularly publishes results of its research and releases code online for free for others to explore. 
In this case, Salesforce circumvented technology called long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) that have become popular for machine translation. Instead, they chose to build on a system called Transformer, which Google unveiled earlier this year.
Translation has been revolutionized by the use of a trendy type of AI called deep learning, which involves training systems called artificial neural networks on lots of data and then getting them to make inferences about new data.
But the neural network-based systems can be slower to make inferences than more traditional architectures, as Socher and four of his collaborators -- Jiatao Gu, James Bradbury, Caiming Xiong and Victor O.K. Li -- point out in a new academic paper. Simply put, their model comes up with the best words for a translation in parallel, instead of in sequential order, which provides a speed boost. 
Bradbury explained some of the team's work with an analogy.
""You have a whole panel of professional translators, and they're all in separate cubicles somewhere,"" he said. ""You want to get a translated sentence, but you don't let them talk to each other. When you ask each of them to output one word, they're not going to make the right guesses about what each other is thinking. They're going to produce something that totally is gibberish. That's the problem that we ended up solving."" 
While Salesforce already offers technology that's based on work from its research lab, machine translation isn't in use in Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or any other product. That could change in the next few years, though.
""I think we'll see especially for technical documentation"" that it can come in handy, Socher said.

 How Salesforce-Google will help buck Amazon   
 6:58  PM ET Tue,  7 Nov 2017 |  01:09 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer knows that playing offense and defense at the same time isn't easy, especially for a business.
 ""Yet whenever I speak to a truly competitive company, that's exactly what they're doing — playing both offense and defense using the power of digital, using the power of technology. They have no choice; if they don't embrace technology they'll be left behind,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
That's why Cramer saw Salesforce.com's partnership with Alphabet's Google, which was announced on Monday, as so important.
 The combination would pair Salesforce's customer relations management systems with Google's analytics and cloud platforms, giving clients more holistic ways to view customer data.
Cramer said the partnership would benefit retailers that compete with Amazon and would prefer not to pay for Amazon Web Services for their cloud-based needs.
""You don't pay your opponent when you're fighting them tooth and nail, not if you can avoid it,"" Cramer said. ""The problem has been that Amazon Web Services, with its amazing analytics that works seamlessly with Salesforce, really does give you an edge you couldn't find anywhere else, at least not until this Salesforce-Google team-up.""
The ""Mad Money"" host pointed to Monday's reports of Amazon launching its first two furniture brands, a sign that the e-commerce colossus could be moving into the furniture industry. 
Whether Amazon will make a wholehearted effort to enter the furniture space remains unclear, but furniture stocks from RH to Williams-Sonoma still suffered considerable losses on the news.
Cramer said that Amazon Web Services (which also partners with Salesforce) gives those retailers advantages in telling their stories and reaching new customers.
But if Amazon becomes a direct competitor, paying for its services becomes less attractive, particularly with Google offering a similarly effective analytics and marketing platform, he said.
""It's defense and it's offense. And judging by the declines of the stocks in the brick-and-mortar segment of this market ... it seems like not enough companies in that sector have a digital strategy that is strong on both sides of the field,"" Cramer said.
But companies, especially retailers, with a sound digital strategy now have an alternative to Amazon that could help them maintain their competitive streak against the e-commerce colossus.
""The bottom line is, no matter what the industry, if you own shares in a company that doesn't have not a digital strategy, but a winning digital strategy, your goose is cooked, as the other guys in the sector will set the oven at 500 degrees and burn your stock to a crisp,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.

Salesforce chairman and CEO Marc Benioff.
 At Dreamforce two years ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had a prime speaking spot and Salesforce's Marc Benioff touted the blossoming partnership between the two companies.
 Those days are gone. 
On Tuesday, Benioff used part of Salesforce's investor day meeting at Dreamforce to talk up Salesforce's expanded partnership with Google and its growing relationships with Amazon, Cisco, Dell and IBM. 
 But he didn't include Microsoft in that group, even after the companies made a big deal about their work together in 2014 and again in 2015.

 CRM's Benioff: How we're getting around the 'loyalty is dead' problem   
 6:57  PM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  01:16 
 It's a complicated relationship. Microsoft and Salesforce compete in areas like business intelligence and customer relationship management software. Beyond that, Microsoft outbid Salesforce for LinkedIn in 2016, and Microsoft previously tried to buy Salesforce.
This week, Salesforce made some moves of its own onto Microsoft's turf, integrating more deeply with both Google and Facebook.
At the investor meeting, Kirk Materne of Evercore asked Benioff if it would be possible for Microsoft and Salesforce to ""come back together on behalf of customers.""
Here's a transcript of what Benioff said in response:
 No, there's always one person in the room who's using a Surface laptop, so I get that. And it's you. Who else is using a Surface laptop? Raise your hand. OK, we have three people. And how many are using Macs? Raise your hand. How many iPads? OK. How many PCs? And then we've got the three Surface. You know, look. They're 1 percent of the CRM market. You know the numbers. I like having competitors. But what I just get blown away with is how they just can't keep, you know, that management team in place. They just keep leaving Microsoft. You know that. And I think they don't have confidence in that ability to execute in that business. So that has weighed to our favor, and customers feel that. You know because you go to these conferences just like I do. There is no conference like this that they do and that's the — in my opinion, the mark. That is — why is it that they don't have anything like this? That when they put on a conference like something — it's always the resellers who come together, and then -- where are these people? Now, that isn't to say they don't have, like, Build, where they get these really high-end developers using the IDE. You know what I mean? Is that the conference I've been to where I'm like, Oh, yeah, these are all the -- and they're all Windows -- they have a Windows fever. And they have Windows API fever at the conference.

19,2017-11-15,Marc Benioff: Salesforce would not exist today without Steve Jobs  ,"In a recent interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff discussed his relationship with late Apple founder Steve Jobs and said that his company would not exist today without him. 
 Benioff was a 19-year-old college student in 1984 when Jobs gave him his first job as an assembly language programmer at Apple. The two kept in touch over the years, and Benioff says that when he was starting Salesforce, Jobs would invite him to his office to tutor and mentor him. 
""He was one of the greatest mentors I had,"" says Benioff.

Apple chief executive Steve Jobs unveils a new mobile phone that can also be used as a digital music player and a camera, a long-anticipated device dubbed an 'iPhone.' at the Macworld Conference 09 January, 2007 in San Francisco, California.
 In the early 2000s, Benioff looked to the tech legend for advice when he was feeling stuck about the direction of his company. Jobs advised him to do three things. 
""One, Salesforce better be 10 times larger in 24 months or less, or else it's over,"" Benioff says Jobs told him. ""Two, you have to close a huge massive customer, like Avon...and three, you've got to build an application economy.""

 Benioff says he went home to brainstorm ways to put those ideas in to action. He thought of developing a huge marketplace for apps, but when Salesforce tested the product in focus groups, people responded that it was more an exchange than a store.

 AppExchange launched in 2005. In 2008, Benioff received a call from Jobs asking him to come to his team's office for a big announcement. To his surprise, the announcement included Apple's launch of the App Store. 
""It was like a spiritual moment,"" said Benioff, ""because we had already launched our AppExchange three years before.""
After the event, Benioff congratulated Jobs on the launch and told him as a gift he was giving Apple the trademark and appstore.com URL he had purchased years ago thanks to his advice. 
""That was a great moment for me because I just remember that he had a huge impact on me personally and on Salesforce,"" Benioff added.  
Jobs impacted many business leaders beyond Benioff. Following Jobs' death in 2011, Bill Gates wrote a blog post about the Apple founder's influence not only on his own life, but on the world. 
""The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come,"" wrote Gates. ""For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it's been an insanely great honor.""

 The two most important things to watch in Salesforce's upcoming earnings report   
 4:21  PM ET Fri, 17 Nov 2017 |  01:23 
 Cloud computing company Salesforce.com is set to report quarterly earnings Tuesday, and one strategist is watching closely, as it's one of the few remaining large tech names to report this earnings season. The technology sector has posted a strong round of earnings, said Mark Tepper, CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners, and Salesforce.com shares have outperformed technology over the course of the year. He will be watching for whether the company can keep up, given the stock's hefty valuation of 66 times forward earnings, according to FactSet data. Here's what he will be looking for to confirm that. • The trend in the company's international growth will be most interesting to Tepper, he explained Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" He said there is more opportunity to be had internationally. • ""We've seen 74 percent of sales coming from the Americas over the course of the last several years. We want to see that trend down, and we want to see more revenues coming from overseas,"" he said. • He is also looking at its bottom-line results to see the extent to which expenses associated with overseas expansion are reflected in its net profits. Tepper added in an email to CNBC that this could prove to be a short-term headwind on profitability. • Salesforce.com's top-line results are likely to benefit from its varied cloud offerings and spending on digital marketing, he added. Analysts are expecting earnings of 37 cents per share, according to FactSet estimates. Salesforce.com shares have advanced 57 percent year to date.  Bottom line: Trends in international growth will be important to watch for in the company's earnings report next week.

21,2017-11-20,Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff: 'There's no finish line when it comes to equality'  ,"In addition to leveraging new technology and increasing revenue, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has another top priority for the $75 billion tech company.
 In an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow, Benioff said that closing the gender and racial pay gap is ""top of mind.""
""I am deeply concerned that we are at a precipice right now,"" the CEO says. ""We need to decide what kind of a society we're going to have going forward.""
 Salesforce has spent a total of $6 million since 2015 in adjusting compensation and bonuses in an effort to close the gender and racial wage gap within the company. The company has also started tracking the number of women holding leadership positions.

 Benioff says that much of a company's culture stems from ""the tone from the top,"" and he's committed to making his message clear.

 ""Do we have enough women on our board of directors?"" he says. ""Do we have enough women in our management team? Do we have enough women in middle management?""
""The answer is generally no, we don't,"" Benioff tells Harlow. ""We wear that and we recognize that.""
Benioff joins a growing number of male teach leaders, including Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who have spoken about the importance of women and diversity within their own companies.
OpenTable CEO Christa Quarles told CNBC Make It that in the wake of the leaked internal memo penned by former Google engineer James Damore, which criticized the company's diversity efforts,  Silicon Valley leaders had a quick and positive response. Quarles feels that more managers, both men and women, are coming together to have conversations on the topic.
""I do believe that if you bring men along for the ride,"" Quarles said, ""you're going to be a lot more successful.""
Benioff says that Salesforce has a long way to go, but so far, he's shown no sign of letting the issue slide.
""There's no finish line,"" he says, ""when it comes to equality.""

 Salesforce beats on bottom line   
 7:31  PM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 |  01:09 
 Enterprise software company Salesforce.com saw its stock sink on Tuesday after it reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter of its 2018 fiscal year, which ended on Oct. 31.
 Salesforce stock was about 2.1 percent lower in premarket trading Wednesday.
 EPS: Excluding certain items, 39 cents per share vs. 37 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $2.68 billion vs. $2.65 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. 
 Salesforce forecast fourth-quarter profit slightly below market expectations, however, even as profits and revenues rose on the back of strong demand for its cloud-based sales and marketing software.
The company said it expects a fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 32 cents to 33 cents per share, excluding certain items, on revenue of $2.80 billion to 2.81 billion. Analysts had expected the company to produce 34 cents in earnings per share, excluding items, and $2.79 billion in revenue for the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.
As a whole, the company's revenue was up 25 percent year over year, according to the company's earnings statement. Almost all of Salesforce's revenue comes from subscriptions and support, and that business segment generated $2.49 billion in revenue; analysts had expected it to hit $2.45 billion in revenue, according to FactSet. But the company's professional services revenue for the quarter, of $193.7 million, was below the FactSet estimate of $201.4 million.
The company also promoted Bret Taylor to be its new president and chief officer. Taylor, who is a Twitter board member, was previously CEO of the start-up Quip under Salesforce following the Quip acquisition in 2016. Meanwhile, Alex Dayon will become president and chief strategy officer after being the company's president and chief product officer. During the company's Tuesday conference call with analysts, CEO Marc Benioff said both Taylor and Dayon will report to him.
Some analysts had been positive about the company in the days leading up to earnings. ""Our checks indicated that its large deal pipeline remains strong while the competitors remain at bay,"" Mizuho analysts Abhey Lamba and Parthiv Varadarajan wrote in a Nov. 12 note.
In its fiscal second quarter, Salesforce beat expectations and raised its guidance for the entire fiscal year. In its fiscal third quarter, Salesforce refreshed its Service Cloud offering and went live on public cloud provider Amazon Web Services' data center infrastructure in Canada.
Salesforce raised its guidance for its entire 2018 fiscal year, pegging it at $10.43 billion to $10.44 billion. Analysts had been expecting $10.39 billion in revenue for the full year.
Salesforce stock is up 59 percent since the beginning of the year, according to FactSet.

Marc Benioff, CEO of SalesForce speaking the 2018 WEF in Davos, Switzerland.
 For the past year, weekly senior staff meetings at global firm Salesforce have been attended by an artificial intelligence (AI) machine known as ""Einstein.""
 Marc Benioff, the cloud-based software company's CEO, revealed Thursday that he relied on the software every Monday morning.
Speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, Benioff was asked to cite an example of how AI could help the world crunch big data.
 ""I have my top 30 or 40 executives around my table,"" he said. ""And we figure out how we are doing as we look at all of this analysis.
""But now I have a new person with me and it's kind of an empty chair. We have a technology called Einstein.""
Benioff said that after he has worked around his room of executives he then quizzes his AI assistant. ""I ask Einstein, 'I heard what everybody said but what do you actually think?'""
 The Salesforce boss said he has been using the technology for a year now, and recently Einstein questioned the reports of one European employee.
""And Einstein said, 'Well, I don't think this executive is going to make their number, I'm so sorry.'""
Benioff said the executive was visibly upset by the claim but after Einstein had processed all the data, the AI machine was able to identify the problems in real time.
""And I could say, 'Well, you've got this problem, and this person hasn't got that in place, and you didn't do this over here.'""
