Visitors queue to play the video game 'Call of Duty, Infinite Warfare' developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision during the 'Paris Games Week' on October 26, 2016 in Paris, France.
 Video game publisher Activision Blizzard's shares leaped Friday after unexpectedly strong fourth quarter results and a share buyback announcement.
 The Santa Monica, California-based company reported adjusted earnings of 92 cents a share for the fourth quarter, 19 cents above estimates, while revenue of $2.45 billion also topped expectations. The company said it had 447 million monthly active users in the quarter, including a record number of monthly active users in the Blizzard division.
Activision Blizzard attributed the solid results to its successful multiplayer shooter game ""Overwatch"" and its acquisition of ""Candy Crush"" maker King Digital last year. The company is known for blockbuster franchises like ""Call of Duty"" and ""World of Warcraft.""
 The firm also announced a two-year buyback program of $1 billion in outstanding common stock, beginning Feb. 13, 2017.
Shares gained more than 18 percent in Friday trade. With Friday's gains, the stock has surged 30 percent so far this year.

 Trading Nation: The best in tech?   
 3:14  PM ET Thu,  3 Aug 2017 |  02:04 
 Activision Blizzard has been on a stealth rally this year, soaring nearly 76 percent, and traders are betting on an even bigger rally ahead.
 The video game giant is the best performing tech stock in 2017, quietly hitting an all-time high on Thursday.
According to Mark Tepper of Strategic Wealth Partners, the gaming industry is growing at around 16 percent a year, and that has grabbed the attention of investors.
 ""We'd be owners. Activision is a really intriguing play. The growth opportunity's huge,"" Tepper said Thursday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""
Tepper added that gaming is ""becoming more social, which means people are playing longer and longer, and the profit per user is growing at 6 percent. This particular company, Activision, they've got the leaders in gaming with Call of Duty, Overwatch, Candy Crush. I'm getting the Candy Crush invitations every day on Facebook, so we'd be a buyer.""
Matt Maley of Miller Tabak said that while he likes the stock at current levels, he would proceed with caution when looking at the tech sector.
""I like the stock here, and especially if it breaks off from its current level, because it would give it a nice higher high,"" he explained. ""[But] as good as Activision looks, there is a yellow flag in the tech stocks overall because the SOX semiconductor index, which has been a key leading subgroup for the tech stocks, is starting to roll over a bit.""
 The tech ETF, XLK, is the best-performing sector this year — surging more than 22 percent.
Maley reiterated that investors should be cautious. ""This really is a yellow flag. If we see further weakness in the stocks, and we have stocks like Micron continuing to break down, that's going to turn a yellow stock into a red stock, and maybe we'll see a little bit more of a breather in the tech rally,"" Tabak warned.
Activision posted better-than-expected earnings of $0.55 per share on $1.42 billion in revenue and reported 407 million monthly active users in the second quarter.

A scene from ""Overwatch"" game.
 Wall Street analysts predict Activision Blizzard is the future of media and entertainment as it enters new businesses such as esports, consumer products and advertising. ""With its stable of core franchises and a multitude of future growth opportunities, ATVI is building a Disney-type media business for the 21st Century, but with (much) higher operating margin,"" Jefferies analyst Timothy O'Shea wrote in a note to clients Friday.
 ""We see large opportunities around eSports, ads, mobile games, full-game downloads, and consumer products. But for 2Q, the big beat was driven by in-game spending, the biggest opportunity of them all.""
The video game maker's shares fell more than 3 percent midday Friday a day even after it reported better than expected second-quarter earnings results.  Activision Blizzard has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market with the shares up 77.2 percent year to date through Thursday versus the S&P 500's 10.4 percent return.
 O'Shea reaffirmed his buy rating and raised his price target for Activision Blizzard to $78 from $68, representing 22 percent upside from Thursday's close.
The analyst cited how the company sold the first seven teams in its esports Overwatch league for approximately $20 million each. He expects Activision Blizzard will be able to create a ""NFL-style"" business on the game with ""broadcast rights, ads and sponsorships."" In addition, O'Shea noted the company has beaten its earnings per share guidance in 90 percent of the last 21 financial quarters. In similar fashion, Baird is bullish on the game maker's future growth markets. ""We remain encouraged by the company's extensive portfolio of key franchises, and believe growth opportunities remain as new titles, growing esports offerings, and improving monetization trends continue to generate upside potential,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in note to clients Thursday. Sebastian reiterated his outperform rating on the company and increased his price forecast to $68 from $60.
Also on Friday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to buy from neutral.

A McDonald's restaurant in St. Petersburg, Russia.
 U.S. companies most exposed to Europe, such as McDonald's and Activision Blizzard, should benefit from the U.S. dollar's slump, Credit Suisse said.
 ""We on the Global Equity Strategy team believe that the dollar is likely entering a long-term bear market,"" Andrew Garthwaite, Credit Suisse's managing director and global equity strategist, said in a note with a team of analysts Tuesday.
""Independent of their sector, we like US corporates with significant euro exposure that are Outperform-rated by CS analysts. Of these companies, Alexion, Gilead, McDonald's, Activision Blizzard and Carnival have positive earnings and sales momentum,"" the report said.
 US companies with significant European exposure that are rated outperform by Credit Suisse
 Source: Credit Suisse
Another stock on the Credit Suisse list of Europe-exposed stocks, Priceline, hit an all-time high Tuesday.
Over the next 12 months, Credit Suisse's FX strategists expect the U.S. dollar to weaken the most against the euro and the Japanese yen, falling 3 percent against each, in contrast to a 2.5 percent decline for the overall U.S. dollar index. The index tracks a basket of global currencies, of which the euro has the greatest weight at more than half.
Garthwaite estimates every 10 percent decline in the U.S. dollar index adds about 5 percent to U.S. earnings per share since about 42 percent of S&P 500 sales come from overseas. A weaker dollar makes U.S. goods cheaper for foreign buyers. 
Within the S&P 500, Garthwaite pointed out the technology sector has the greatest overseas exposure at 59 percent of sales and the semiconductor subsector generates an even higher 82 percent of sales from outside the U.S.
""A weaker US dollar should be another tailwind helping technology to continue its outperformance,"" Garthwaite said.
Technology has climbed more than 23 percent this year as the top performer in the S&P 500 and the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has gained 22 percent. 
The U.S. dollar index has fallen to lows not seen in more than a year and dropped in July for its first five-month losing streak since 2011. 
The euro has climbed to highs not seen in more than two-and-a-half years as euro zone economic data has improved and the European Central Bank appears ready to cut back on stimulus.
That said, the U.S. dollar index isn't a one-way trade lower. The currency index turned higher Tuesday to hit its highest in more than one week after the Bureau of Labor Statistics said job openings hit a record high in June.
The dollar remains more than 8 percent lower for the year.

 Capital Group Equity Portfolio Manager Carl Kawaja said he  thinks Sony is on its way to becoming a ""significant company"" again.
 ""I think they are on the verge of coming out of that"" decline, Kawaja said Wednesday at the Sohn Conference in San Francisco. ""I think they are on [their way to] becoming a significant company once again.""
Kawaja said he likes Sony for its new management, especially its chief financial officer, Kenichiro Yoshida. The Japanese company also has strong businesses opportunities in gaming, image sensors and music streaming, he said.
 Kawaja pointed out that Sony is under-appreciated by the market because despite the breadth of its business units, the company has a market value of about $50 billion, around the same size as Activision Blizzard. 
Los Angeles-based Capital Group sells a variety of mutual funds and had $1.4 trillion in assets under management, as of the end of last year.
Wednesday's event is the West Coast version of the prominent investment conferences which began in New York and are best known for hedge fund managers making market-moving presentations. The Sohn conferences benefit pediatric cancer and other causes for underserved youth. The conference is presented in partnership with CNBC.

 It is time to take some profits on the red-hot video gaming stocks after a huge run, according to one Wall Street analyst who nailed the rally.
 Cowen reduced its rating for Activision Blizzard shares to market perform from outperform, citing the risk its new esports league will do worse than expected.
This is the firm's first downgrade of the video game maker in nine years, according to its analyst. Activision Blizzard shares have risen more than 600 percent since the end of 2008 through Friday versus the S&P 500's 182 percent return.
 ""We remain confident about the trajectory of Activision's core business, with Call of Duty likely to rebound this year and Black Ops 4 likely due for release next year. However, we have a significant bit of nervousness around the debut of Overwatch League,"" analyst Doug Creutz wrote in a note to clients Monday.
The analyst said a significant portion of Activision Blizzard's valuation premium versus its industry peers is ""based on investor optimism around the potential for esports to be a large profit generator in the future.""
The company's vaunted Overwatch esports league is slated to launch on Dec. 6 with 12 teams.""As this is the first time a publisher has ever attempted to launch a major esport from scratch, we expect OWL 1.0 to be a learning experience, and thus believe that the probability of reality failing to meet investor expectations is relatively high,"" he wrote.
Activision Blizzard and Take-Two shares are up 75 percent and 118 percent respectively year to date through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 14 percent return.
The analyst reiterated his $66 price target for Activision Blizzard shares, representing 4 percent upside to Friday's close.
Creutz also lowered his rating to market perform from outperform for Take-Two shares Monday, citing concerns over the company's lengthening gap between title releases.
While Take-Two's ""digital initiatives have certainly borne fruit, the frequency of highly successful title releases still has a significant bearing on the company's average earnings power,"" he wrote.
""From a tactical perspective, we also believe that many investors are in TTWO shares specifically in anticipation of RDR 2's release, with a meaningful risk of a post-launch sell-off in shares.""
Red Dead Redemption 2 is scheduled to be released in the spring of 2018, nearly eight years after the first Red Dead Redemption. The analyst reaffirmed his $83 price target for Take-Two shares, representing 23 percent downside to Friday's close.
Shares of Activision Blizzard and Take-Two declined 2.8 percent and 3.5 percent respectively midday Monday following the reports.
Activision Blizzard and Take-Two did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A cosplayer dressed as Blackhardt from 'Overwatch' attends the C2E2 Crown Champions of Cosplay at McCormick Place on April 22, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois.
 Activision Blizzard reported earnings and revenue that beat expectations Thursday and raised its full-year guidance.  
 Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:
 EPS: 60 cents vs. 49 cents expected according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates Revenue: $1.90 billion vs. $1.74 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates 
 Stock initially fell as much as 4 percent but has since recovered to trade 2 percent higher in the after-hours session.
Analysts had projected a mixed third quarter for Activision Blizzard, as the gamemaker behind ""Candy Crush"" and ""Call of Duty"" seeks to stake its claim in the burgeoning esports industry.
Activision Blizzard reported a dip in monthly active users for the quarter at 384 million — down 6 percent from the previous quarter and down 20 percent year over year. 
Activision Blizzard's King game segment — which released ""Candy Crush Saga"" five years ago — saw 100 million fewer monthly active users year over year. 
Here's how each segment did compared to revenue estimates for the third quarter:
 Activision: $759 million vs. $690 million expected according to StreetAccount Blizzard: $531 million vs. $508 million expected according to StreetAccount King: $528 million vs. $483 million expected according to StreetAccount 
The company raised its full-year guidance and now expects adjusted earnings per share of $2.08 on $6.68 billion in revenue. Activision Blizzard had previously projected adjusted full-year earnings of $1.94 on $6.40 billion in revenue.
Activision Blizzard's Overwatch esports league, which turns the popular sports title professional, is expected to launch in December. But some analysts are concerned the league may not be an immediate success.
""We're building the League for the long term, and in our view, the opportunity rivals what you see in professional sports from a lot of perspectives but starting with the demographics of the audience,"" CEO Robert Kotick said on an earnings conference call. ""The first season is really about building a solid foundation."" 
To be sure, Activision Blizzard is still one of the biggest names in the gaming industry and is well-positioned to take on rivals Electronic Arts and Take Two in the esports market. 
The company, in line with the rest of the industry, is pushing digital game sales as physical sales continue to fall. Earlier this month, reports said physical sales of the company's second ""Destiny"" title were approximately 50 percent below those of the original. 
The company's stock has rocketed 80 percent year to date, ahead of the report.

 Crazy post-earnings action in Starbucks & Activision Blizzard   
 11:51  AM ET Wed,  8 Nov 2017 |  00:57 
 When the stock market acts unexpectedly, CNBC's Jim Cramer says you just have to roll with the punches, like investors did with the stocks of Activision Blizzard and Starbucks on Friday.
 Both companies reported their quarterly earnings after Thursday's bell. Activision Blizzard, the video game giant behind ""Call of Duty"" and ""Candy Crush,"" beat analyst estimates and raised its full-year guidance. Shares popped in early-hours trading on the better-than-expected results.
Meanwhile, shares of Starbucks shed more than 3 percent after the coffeemaker reported a revenue miss, slowing domestic same-store sales and slashed long-term guidance.
 ""But when the market opened this morning, Activision Blizzard's stock collapsed while Starbucks' stock soared,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""How the heck is that even possible? Well, you see, it's all in the expectations.""
When a company's earnings results are lower than Wall Street's expectations, its stock typically declines. When they are higher than what the Street expects, the company's stock tends to rally.
In Starbucks' case, most of its larger shareholders saw the growth rate cut as ""a given,"" Cramer said. Smaller investors who weren't expecting the guidedown sold the stock on Thursday, but buyers who expected it bought into Starbucks on Friday morning, erasing its losses.
The stock soared further after Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson's interview on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street,"" in which he talked about the company's 20 percent dividend increase, share buyback program, mobile pay improvements and accelerating growth in China.
Activision Blizzard's management, on the other hand, made the mistake of talking about holiday sales competition on its post-earnings conference call, the ""Mad Money"" host said.
News of the company's expanding esports business and professional Overwatch league fell on deaf ears.
""What's ironic here is that I think that Activision Blizzard should be bought and bought aggressively, which is something we told members of the ActionAlertsPlus.com club many times today,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""But you know what? I would not chase the stock of Starbucks here unless we knew for sure that the guidance they gave, the new guidance, wasn't too optimistic.""

 Goldman: Activision shares to get a boost from Overwatch, Diablo sequels   
 2:10  PM ET Tue, 12 Dec 2017 |  00:48 
 Activision Blizzard's upcoming franchise title launches will be big blockbuster sellers, according to one top Wall Street firm.
 Goldman Sachs raised its rating for Activision Blizzard shares to buy from neutral, predicting the company will report profits above expectations in 2019 and 2020.
""We believe the recent sell-off in Video Game stocks has largely been due to technical factors relating to positioning around tax reform, and does not reflect any change in fundamentals for the group. We therefore see attractive entry points across our coverage, particularly for ATVI,"" analyst Christopher Merwin wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We are raising our 2019 and 2020 estimates on account of a robust multi year pipeline of games — Diablo, Overwatch 2, and a Blizzard mobile title — which we don't think Street estimates are fully taking into account.""
 Activision Blizzard shares are up 75 percent year to date through Monday compared with the S&P 500's 19 percent return. The stock is 6 percent off its Nov. 3 52-week high of $67.03.
The analyst increased his 12-month price target for Activision Blizzard shares to $73 from $67, representing 16 upside to Monday's close.
Merwin predicts the company's next ""Diablo"" game will be released in 2019 and sell 15 million units. He also forecasts ""Overwatch 2"" will launch in 2020 and sell 20 million units in its first year. The analyst noted how the previous ""Diablo"" and ""Overwatch"" titles sold 30 million units in three years and more than 16 million units in its first year respectively, according to his estimates.
""When adding in the potential for non-recurring titles — Diablo, Overwatch 2, and Blizzard mobile — we believe Street estimates … seem rather conservative, particularly in 2019 and 2020,"" he wrote.
As a result, Merwin estimates Activision Blizzard will generate earnings per share of $3.04 in 2019 versus the Wall Street consensus of $2.90. He also predicts the company will report earnings per share of $3.40 in 2020 versus the $3.19 average estimate.
Activision Blizzard shares are up 1 percent Tuesday after the report.

 Analyst: Gamers are upset about microtransactions in Activision's 'Destiny 2'   
 10:26  AM ET Wed, 24 Jan 2018 |  00:51 
 Player interest in Activision Blizzard's ""Destiny 2"" is dropping, which will hurt the game publisher's add-on revenue this year, one Wall Street firm predicts.
 Cowen reiterated its market perform rating on Activision Blizzard shares, citing increasing evidence players are leaving the ""Destiny"" community.
""While Call of Duty: WWII clearly had a great holiday, which likely sets up strong franchise live services revenue in 2018, Destiny 2 is struggling right now with player engagement appearing to be on the wane,"" analyst Doug Creutz wrote in a note to clients Tuesday entitled ""Destiny is Not in a Good Place.""
 ""We are a bit cautious that potentially disappointing live service revenue there could at least partially offset upside from CoD in 2018,"" he said
Creutz reaffirmed his $66 price target for Activision Blizzard shares, representing 7 percent downside to Monday's close.
He said several key ""Destiny"" video streamers have announced they will reduce content for the game in the future. He noted Twitch viewership for the game is at ""franchise-low"" levels averaging 4,000 to 7,000 viewers on Friday afternoons versus 14,000 to 17,000 for ""Destiny 1"" one year ago.
Creutz also shared four key reasons why he believes the game is faltering:
 1. ""Design decisions were made that have made D2 a less engaging, and less distinctive, game than D1. In particular, key aspects of the D2 end game feel neutered compared to D1.""2. ""Microtransaction implementation, while not nearly as problematic as in Star Wars Battlefront 2, has still been a source of player unhappiness.""3. ""Bungie's [the studio that developed the game] apparent urgency in responding to player feedback has been disappointing.""4. ""Until recently, Bungie did a poor job communicating its road map going forward, particularly compared to the more open stance of many other live service games."" 
As a result, the analyst is not optimistic the company will be able to turn the ""Destiny"" franchise around.
""We do think Bungie still has some opportunity to fix the game's problems over the next year and recapture engagement, but we're not sure they have the ability to pull it off at this point,"" he wrote. ""We also note that Destiny currently has more serious competition in its genre from a refurbished Division (Ubisoft) and the indie title Warframe than it did three years ago, when D1 had its own share of player dissatisfaction.""
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Activision beats on bottom line   
 6:47  PM ET Thu,  8 Feb 2018 |  00:44 
 Video game publisher Activision Blizzard reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations on Thursday.
 Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:
 EPS: 94 cents vs. 93 cents expected, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $2.64 billion vs. $2.55 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters 
 Shares of Activision gained nearly 5 percent after the news. They were last seen trading slightly below that level, but were still 3 percent higher from their closing price. 
Analysts had expected the company to give conservative guidance. 
On Thursday, Activision said it expects adjusted full-year earnings of $2.50 a share on net bookings of $7.45 billion. Prior to the earnings release, Wall Street had forecast fiscal 2018 earnings of $2.57 a share on $7.41 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.
Here is what each of the company's businesses reported in revenue for the quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to Street Account consensus estimates:
 Activision: $1.34 billion vs. $1.40 billion expected  Blizzard: $599 million vs. $526.1 million expected  King: $516 million vs. $508.2 million expected 
King, the maker of ""Candy Crush,"" saw year-over-year growth in revenue, beating analyst expectations. The segment reported $516 million in net revenue, more than the $508.2 million expected by analysts according to Street Account.
Analysts had expected a solid quarter led by the successful launch of Activision's ""Call of Duty: WWII."" The video game debuted in early November and surpassed $1 billion in sales after about six weeks, according to the company. The title went on to become the top grossing console game of the year globally, the company said Thursday. 
""We believe a strong Q4 is largely baked into investor expectations at this point, so post-earnings stock action could hinge on the initial outlook for 2018,""  Piper Jaffray analysts  Michael J. Olson and Yung Kim wrote in a note to investors in January. 
Meanwhile, the video game giant behind ""World of Warcraft"" is making a big bet on esports,  kicking off the inaugural season of its Overwatch League last month. That holds the promise of new revenue streams. 
""All of the commercial opportunities that exist in professional sports are opportunities that are available to us also,"" CEO Bobby Kotick told CNBC in January. ""Plus you have virtual items. You have over-the-top advertising opportunities that wouldn't exist in traditional sports.""
As of its Thursday close, Activision Blizzard's stock is up about 68 percent over the last 12 months, compared with the S&P 500's 12 percent return.

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Activision Blizzard expects earnings of $2.50 a share on $7.45 billion in revenue for fiscal 2018. A previous version of this story misstated those figures.
