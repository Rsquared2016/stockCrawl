 In 25 years, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish   
 12:55  AM ET Wed, 22 Feb 2017 |  01:35 
 U.S. technology giant Dell and Hollywood actor Adrian Grenier are making waves as they launch their global pilot program to turn the tide on ocean pollution. By pulling plastics out of the ocean and recycling them into a commercially viable way, they hope to keep harmful micro plastics from troubling ocean waters.
 Dell's pilot program is on pace to use 16,000 pounds of ocean plastics in 2017. Grenier, star of the HBO series ""Entourage"" and a famed environmentalist, is one of the speakers at the World Ocean Summit in Bali, Indonesia this year. 
The 40-year old became a strong advocate for ocean conservation when he started to ""personally notice there was less fish and more plastic"" in waters, he told CNBC's Street Signs on Wednesday. In 2015, he co-founded the non-profit Lonely Whale Foundation, which champions ocean action.

 Deeming the ocean ""the most under-served"" ecosystem, Grenier explained that the connection between the sea and humanity is closer than some might think.
""There are whales that have been beached and when there's an autopsy, they find all sorts of things inside their bellies. And it's not just whales, its marine birds and fish,"" he said. ""By the way, some of us do enjoy fish and we also ingest that. So, scientists are finding plastic within humans because of the ocean problem.""
With the intention to create a circular economy, Dell teamed up with Grenier's foundation and is collecting plastics from waterways, beaches and shorelines before they break down into micro plastics.

 After the plastics go through processing and refinement, Dell mixes the ocean plastic with other recycled HDPE plastics to make packaging trays for its laptops. The transition to ocean plastics packaging for Dell's XPS 13 2-in-1 notebook will begin in April 2017 — the company's first such wide-scale production.
The World Ocean Summit runs from February 22 to 24 and features financing a sustainable ocean economy at the top of its agenda. Grenier, too, is looking to ""make contacts and see who wants to join [the foundation] in helping to scale [its] program to take ocean-bound plastic and put it into the supply chain of different companies.""

 Dell announces pay-as-you-go cloud financing model   
 11:17  AM ET Mon,  8 May 2017 |  01:03 
 Dell is launching a pay-as-you-go model for its cloud services business as an alternative to the offerings of rivals Amazon, Microsoft and Google, CEO Michael Dell told CNBC on Monday.
 The change in pay model was ""a natural evolution,"" he said on ""Squawk Alley.""
""We've been gradually embracing this for some time, but we talk about this as consumption models. So, pay-as-you-grow, pay-as-you-use, pay-per-use — and we're absolutely embracing that. It's what our customers are asking us to do, and we're happy to do it,"" said Dell.
 Dell said leading software as a service companies are starting to realize the public cloud is too expensive, which has led companies like Dropbox to pull out. ""Because the operating cost of the infrastructure itself is too large of a cost relative to their overall P&L,"" he said.
""We've seen a bit of a boomerang effect where, you know, customers have run to the public cloud and say, 'Hey, wait a second, this is more expensive,'"" said Dell.
In an interview with CNBC, Dell also said this new offering would be good for Snap — which is a large user of cloud services and reports earnings for the first time this week. 
""I guarantee you we can save them some money,"" he said.

All references must be sourced to CNBC.
KELLY EVANS: WELCOME BACK. JUST MINUTES AGO SALESFORCE ANNOUNCED A STRATEGIC AGREEMENT WITH DELL TECHNOLOGIES WHERE DELL WILL EXPAND THE USE OF SALESFORCE'S CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT OR CRM PLATFORM. IN A CNBC EXCLUSIVE WE ARE NOW JOINED BY SALESFORCE CEO MARC BENIOFF AND DELL TECHNOLOGIES CEO MICHAEL DELL. WELCOME TO BOTH OF YOU. THIS IS A VERY CROSS COUNTRY TYPE OF INTERVIEW HAPPENING HERE. IT IS WONDERFUL AND WE'LL MAKE SURE WE CAN KIND OF KEEP THINGS MOVING AROUND. BUT, MARC, LET ME JUST ASK YOU FIRST WHAT IS SO KEY TO YOU ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT?
MARC BENIOFF: WELL, I THINK, YOU KNOW, EVERY COMPANY IS GOING THROUGH A DRAMATIC DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION TODAY, BUT I DON'T THINK ANY IS GOING THROUGH A BIGGER TRANSFORMATION THAN DELL. LOOK, THERE'S NO CEO WHO HAS DONE A BETTER JOB OF THAT THAN MICHAEL DELL. HE TOOK HIS COMPANY PRIVATE. NOW HE HAS ACQUIRED EMC. HE HAS CREATED THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY COMPANY AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SALESFORCE AND DELL.
EVANS: MR. DELL, WHAT WILL THIS ALLOW YOUR CLIENTS TO DO OR YOUR CUSTOMERS TO DO NOW THEY COULDN'T PREVIOUSLY?
MICHAEL DELL: SO, ACROSS DELL TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE ALMOST 40,000 SALES PEOPLE AND ABOUT 200,000 CHANNEL PARTNERS, AND WE'RE ENABLING ALL OF THEM WITH THE SALESFORCE TOOLS AS WE HAVE REALLY FOR OVER A DECADE, AND NOW WITH THE COMBINATION OF DELL AND EMC AND VMWARE AND PIVOTAL AND VIRTUSTREAM AND RSA AND SECUREWORKS AND BOOMI, WE CREATED THIS NEW COMPANY, DELL TECHNOLOGIES AND SALESFORCE IS A FANTASTIC PARTNER.
EVANS: MICHAEL, IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT YOUR ETHOS, THAT THE COMPANY'S ETHOS AT THIS POINT IS VERY MUCH A BET ON THE PRIVATE CLOUD IN CONTRAST TO THE PUBLIC CLOUD SERVICES THAT AMAZON AND GOOGLE OFFER?
DELL: WELL, YOU KNOW, MARC IS BUILDING A CLOUD, YOU KNOW, LARGELY POWERED BY DELL TECHNOLOGIES. WHAT WE SEE IS THE CLOUD IS ACTUALLY NOT A PLACE, BUT RATHER A WAY OF DOING I.T. SO YOU'RE SEEING THIS MULTI-CLOUD WORLD EMERGE WHERE THERE'S CERTAINLY A PUBLIC CLOUD, THERE'S SOFTWARES AND SERVICE, THERE'S MANAGED SERVICE, THERE'S HYBRID CLOUD, ON PREMISE. THERE'S NO QUESTION WE ARE THE LEADER IN INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS. SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE SELLING MORE SERVERS AND MORE STORAGE AND MORE SOFTWARE DEFINED DATA CENTER, MORE VIRTUALIZATION, YOU KNOW, THAN ANYONE ON THE PLANET. THIS CLOUD AS AN OPERATING MODEL IS BEING DEPLOYED BROADLY. MARC IS DOING IT, THE PUBLIC CLOUDS ARE DOING IT, AND NOW YOU'RE SEEING THE SOFTWARE DEFINED DATA CENTER COME INTO LARGE COMPANIES AND EVEN SMALL COMPANIES. WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT'S $25,000, THAT STARTS AT ZERO MONEY DOWN, THAT WE CHARGE MONTHLY FOR. IT IS A CLOUD IN A BOX. SO, AGAIN, WE THINK OF CLOUDS NOT AS A PLACE BUT AS A WAY OF DOING I.T. ONE THAT MARC VERY MUCH PIONEERED.
EVANS: MICHAEL, ALL THE SAME, I DO RECALL YOU TOLD OUR JON FORTT NOT LONG AGO YOU THINK THE PUBLIC CLOUD IN SOME WAYS IS TOO EXPENSIVE. I THINK YOU ACTUALLY SAID YOU COULD SAVE SNAPCHAT SOME MONEY, AND I'M SURE THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES. IS THAT THE CASE? BECAUSE WE ALL KIND OF THINK OF THESE CLOUD SERVICES AS SUCH A CHEAP INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY? BUT ARE COMPANIES FINDING THEY CAN DO IT CHEAPER IN-HOUSE?
DELL: WE ARE SEEING A BOOMERANG AND REPATRIATION EFFECT AS COMPANIES RUN TO THE CLOUD WHAT THEY REALIZE IN THE PUBLIC CLOUD IS THAT NOT ALL WORK LOADS ARE APPROPRIATE. I'M CERTAINLY NOT SAYING THERE IS A ROLL FOR THE PUBLIC CLOUD, THERE IS, BUT IT'S A MULTI-CLOUD WORLD. YOU WILL HAVE SOFTWARES AS SERVICE. WHEN YOU MODERNIZE AND AUTOMATE THE ON PREMISE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND PARTICULARLY WITH A SOFTWARE DEFINED DATA CENTER, USING THE LATEST TOOLS THAT WE HAVE, WE'VE HAD MANY CUSTOMERS TELL US THAT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE OF A PUBLIC CLOUD FOR THE PREDICTABLE PART OF THE WORK LOAD, WHICH FOR MANY CUSTOMERS IS 85-TO-90%. MARC, HIMSELF, AS HE WENT TO GO BUILD OUT HIS CLOUD, HE FOUND THAT WAS LESS EXPENSIVE TO BUY EQUIPMENT FROM US THAN TO PUT IT ALL IN THE PUBLIC CLOUD. AND MANY CUSTOMERS ARE FINDING THE SAME THING.
EVANS: MARC, I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT. JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE PUTTING DELL INSIDE A LOT OF YOUR OFFERINGS. WHY IS THIS A FURTHER STEP? SO TALK – YOU CALL THIS AN AGREEMENT, BUT I DON'T KNOW. YOU ARE WORKING TOGETHER A LOT, MARC. IS THERE MAYBE SOMETHING MORE? IS THIS A BUDDING ROMANCE HERE? A BROMANCE?
BENIOFF: WELL, YEAH, MICHAEL AND I DEFINITELY LOVE EACH OTHER. BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WHAT MICHAEL SAID IS 100% RIGHT, WHICH IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING A COMPANY LIKE SALESFORCE, YOU NEED A LOT OF RELATIONSHIPS TO BUILD A GREAT COMPANY. AND DELL HAS BEEN A CRITICAL, CRITICAL RELATIONSHIP FOR US TO BUILD OUR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE. OF COURSE, WE HAVE A PHENOMENAL RELATIONSHIP WITH AMAZON, WITH AWS. WE HAVE A PHENOMENAL RELATIONSHIP WITH IBM USING SOME OF THEIR CLOUD SERVICES AND WATSON. THAT HAS BEEN AN AI RELATIONSHIP, AN AI ALLIANCE WITH US THAT'S BEEN REALLY IMPORTANT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOMEBODY LIKE DELL, WHAT'S POWERFUL HERE FOR US IN THE UNITED STATES, WE RUN OUR OWN DATA CENTERS, WE NEED THIS INCREDIBLE CAPABILITY THAT MICHAEL OFFERS. NOT JUST IN COMPUTING, BUT ALSO IN STORAGE AND SO MANY OTHER KEY AREAS, NETWORKING, ON AND ON. IT'S ALL MADE POSSIBLE BY THIS INCREDIBLE COMPANY THAT HE HAS PUT TOGETHER AND THIS IS TRANSFORMATIONAL FOR OUR INDUSTRY. AND THAT IS WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT DELL AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT DELL AND SALESFORCE COMING TOGETHER TO CREATE A DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, NOT JUST FOR DELL BUT ALSO FOR ALL OF OUR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS.
EVANS: MARC, THE INTERESTING THING RIGHT NOW, AND AS MICHAEL HAD PUT IT, SORT OF MOVING INTO A MULTI-CLOUD WORLD, THERE ARE A LOT OF CUSTOMERS WHO JUST WANT A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO PICK FROM. AT THE SAME TIME, AND I FOUND IT KIND OF HILARIOUS THAT CLOUD COMPUTING WON THE PREAKNESS ON SATURDAY, IT DOES FEEL LIKE WE'RE AT THE TOP OF A BIT OF A HYPE CYCLE WHEN IT COMES TO ALL OF THESE OFFERINGS. SO, WHAT SETS THIS – YOU CALLED IT A TRANSFORMATIONAL DEAL – WHAT SETS THIS AGREEMENT APART FROM THE OFFERINGS ALREADY IN PLACE ACROSS THIS INDUSTRY?
BENIOFF: WELL, YOU KNOW, SALESFORCE JUST TURNED 18. AND YOU KNOW THAT THIS YEAR WE'RE PASSING $10.3 BILLION IN REVENUE. WE JUST REPORTED OUR RESULTS LAST QUARTER, GROWING 25% FOR THE QUARTER. AT THIS GROWTH RATE, NO SOFTWARE COMPANY HAS EVER GROWN FASTER. AND WHAT MADE THAT POSSIBLE IS CLOUD COMPUTING. NOT THE HORSE. BUT THE IDEA THAT COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO BUY THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AND CAPABILITIES TO GET GOING QUICKLY. THE REALITY IS MICHAEL HAS A PHENOMENAL OPPORTUNITY INFRONT OF HIM TO HELP SO MANY COMPANIES, NOT JUST OURS, BUT SO MANY COMPANIES BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT THAT MEANS HIS SALES, HIS SERVICE, HIS MARKETING NEEDS TO BE DEPLOYED RIGHT NOW AND HE NEEDS TO CREATE CUSTOMER SUCCESS RIGHT NOW. WE ARE GOING TO HELP HIM DO THAT.
EVANS: UNDERSTOOD. THIS WASN'T EASY TO PULL OFF THIS KIND OF – YOU KNOW, WE HAVE CALIFORNIA, WE HAVE TEXAS, WE HAVE NEW YORK. GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US TODAY. MARC BENIOFF AND MICHAEL BELL.

 });Enterprise software company Pivotal Software, which was spun out of EMC and its subsidiary, VMware, a few years ago, is looking at an initial public offering by the middle of next year, according to sources familiar with the matter. They did not give details on the size of the estimated float.

Rob Mee, CEO, Pivotal Software
 The San Francisco-based company is an offshoot of software development consulting firm Pivotal Labs, which was previously acquired by EMC. Pivotal Software started with cloud technology from VMware, big data capabilities provided by EMC and a $105 million investment from General Electric.
It is also backed by major names like Ford, which led a funding round along with Microsoft and others that valued Pivotal at $2.8 billion.
 When asked about the IPO, Pivotal CEO, Rob Mee, told CNBC, ""We'll definitely do it when the market conditions and the business conditions are just right.""
Last year, VMware, EMC and Pivotal became subsidiaries of Dell Technologies.
Pivotal helps companies build, test, deploy and update software applications that can run either on public cloud such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure or on private cloud.
Mee said there is an emphasis on doing knowledge transfer at the firm that allows developers to continuously learn and that Pivotal does not hold anything back as competitive advantage.
""Everything that we do is open-source ... in that mode of openness, now that we provide cloud technology as well, which we have built over the last four years, (the cloud business) has become a big growth engine for us,"" said Mee.
Last year, the cloud business saw a 130 percent on-year increase, with its flagship software — Pivotal Cloud Foundry — selling over $270 million in annual bookings.
Mee said he expects the business to grow again in 2017 because there is a realization among well-heeled legacy companies that they need to develop agile, cloud-based software to remain on par with their industry disruptors.
For years, established companies have been on the defensive as they tackled threats from venture-backed start-ups, many of which created new markets for e-commerce, ride sharing, social networks and others, and reaped the commercial benefits.
Industry experts say that cloud computing has become a crucial part of the business for most companies. Earlier this year, Gartner said the global public cloud services market is expected to grow 18 percent in 2017 to $246.8 billion, up from $209.2 billion in 2016, but may taper off over the next few years. Cloud application services are predicted to grow 20.1 percent to $46.3 billion this year.
""The future for cloud is bright ... adoption will increase within the majority of organizations,"" Michael Warrilow, research vice president at Gartner, told CNBC. ""There is definitely a place for smaller companies to use big public cloud providers for their advantage.""
Businesses are now thinking in terms of what Mee called a ""DevOps"" (Development Ops) mindset, where there's greater collaboration between software developers and information technology professionals to create cloud-focused solutions that can be modified quickly to change business needs.
""Companies want a multi-cloud strategy,"" he said.
Pivotal counts over a third of the Fortune 100 companies as clients, including six of the top automakers, seven of the largest banks and five major insurers in the world.
Indeed, the firm addresses a pain point that consultants at PwC previously called the ""Goldilocks syndrome"", where changing regulations, productivity pressures and complex customer engagement models left businesses unsure how much to customize their software. Too much leaves a system expensive to maintain, while generic versions force firms to cram their business model into the software's function.
""Software development is optimized for continuous change is essentially what it is,"" said Mee. ""Prior to that, software development had tried to limit change because it was seen as risky. It turns out that in order to move safely, you have to move much more quickly.""
Pivotal has also expanded its presence Asia, and picked up key customers including Singapore's largest lender DBS Bank and Australian telco giant Telstra.
Though legacy companies in the region have yet to face the same kind of disruption their counterparts in the U.S. have experienced, Lionel Lim, managing director for Asia Pacific and Japan at Pivotal, told CNBC that Pivotal's strategy in Asia is to go after the large customers first. ""Because they will be the ones that'll be hit first,"" he said.
Mee added, ""The timing is really good for us to step up investment in Asia in a big way.""

 Dell considering sale to VMware in what may be tech's biggest deal ever   
 1:33  PM ET Mon, 29 Jan 2018 |  02:13 
 Dell Technologies could emerge as a public company through a reverse-merger with VMware, the $60 billion cloud computing company it already controls, according to people familiar with the matter.
 The reverse merger, whereby VMware would actually buy the larger Dell, would then allow Dell to be traded publicly without going through a formal listing. It would also likely be the biggest deal in tech industry history, giving investors who backed Dell's move to go private in 2013 a way to monetize their deal, while helping Dell pay down some of its approximately $50 billion debt.
VMware's stock fell sharply on the news. At midday, it was down 8.5 percent. 
 While Dell may also pursue a more traditional initial public offering, said the people, a reverse merger would allow the company to avoid a new public offering. Dell hasn't decided on a strategic option and is also considering several other paths forward, including other acquisitions or buying the remaining stake of VMware it doesn't own, as has been previously reported. Dell is unlikely to sell the company outright or sell its stake in VMware, one of the people said. News of Dell's interest in returning to the public markets was previously reported by Bloomberg.

 VMware could buy Dell in reverse merger   
 8:52  AM ET Fri,  2 Feb 2018 |  02:40 
 VMware was seen as the crown jewel in 2015 when Dell acquired EMC for $67 billion. That gave Dell 80 percent of VMware, which was an early pioneer in a technology called virtualization. That process gave companies a way to run the large computers in their data centers more efficiently by packing multiple ""virtual"" computers on a single piece of hardware.
While the technique is still widely used, VMware's growth prospects have been tempered as companies have moved more of their infrastructure from their own data centers to large cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft. In 2016, the company agreed to let customers run its software on arch-rival Amazon's cloud service, an admission that the cloud model is taking precedence.
The reverse-merger is one of the more audacious strategic initiatives being looked at by Dell and its advisers, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private.  Dell's board of directors will meet next month to consider a slew of options, many of which are still in the early stages of examination, including the reverse merger. 
If VMware were to buy Dell, VMware would issue shares to Michael Dell and Silver Lake, the private owners of Dell. The owners could then sell shares on the public market as a way of monetizing their investment in Dell, the people said.
The exact valuation of Dell isn't known because the company is private. Dell took itself private in a $24.4 billion deal in 2013. It then acquired EMC for $67 billion in 2015, a deal that still stands as the largest technology acquisition of all time.

 Theoretically, a VMware acquisition for Dell would top that, making it the largest technology deal ever. Dell acquired more than 80 percent of VMware when it completed its deal for EMC in 2016. VMware's platform virtualization software was a key reason Dell pursued EMC two years ago.
While VMware's revenue has consistently grown each year, that has slowed. Annual sales rose 6.7 percent in 2016 from 2015 after six consecutive years of double-digit percentage growth. Still, net income of $1.2 billion was an all-time high for the company for 2016, and 2017 full-year estimates suggest the company will top that mark. 
Spokespeople for Dell and VMware declined to comment.

 Dell considering sale to VMware in what may be tech's biggest deal ever   
 1:33  PM ET Mon, 29 Jan 2018 |  02:13 
 Dell Technologies on Friday confirmed that it is considering a series of options, combining with VMware or a public offering of Dell.
 CNBC reported earlier this week that Dell Technologies could emerge as a public company through a reverse-merger with VMware, the $50 billion cloud computing company it already controls.
Dell did not provide any details about how a deal with VMware would be structure and reiterated in the statement that ""nothing has been decided and alternatives are just being considered at this stage.""
 VMware, which saw its shares climb about 1 percent in pre-market trading on this news, issued its own statement Friday morning but didn't delve into any details about a potential deal with Dell.
""Dell has been a tremendous partner since it became our majority owner and as we've accelerated our growth,"" said VMware CEO Pat Gelsinger, in the statement. ""We look forward to Dell's continued support as we work to execute our growth plans in the years ahead.""
VMware was seen as the crown jewel in 2015 when Dell acquired EMC for $67 billion. That gave Dell 80 percent of VMware, which was an early pioneer in a technology called virtualization.
