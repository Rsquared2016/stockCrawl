 Priceline beats on top & bottom lines   
 7:12  PM ET Mon, 27 Feb 2017 |  00:50 
 Priceline shares gained 3 percent in extended trading Monday after the company reported earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations.
 Here is how the company did compared with analyst expectations:— EPS: $14.21 vs. $13.01 expected, according to Thomson Reuters' consensus— Revenue: $2.35 billion vs. $2.32 billion expected, according to Reuters— Gross bookings: $15.11 billion vs. $14.57 billion expected, according to FactSet's consensus 
Priceline posted fourth-quarter earnings of $14.21 a share on $2.35 billion in revenue. Those figures easily topped comparable year-earlier earnings per share of $10.73 on more than $1.99 billion in revenue.
 CEO Glenn Fogel said the company saw ""accelerating growth in room nights booked for the full year 2016 over 2015.""
Shares of the travel technology company initially gained about 3 percent in after-hours trading. The stock later pared those gains and was last seen more than 1 percent higher.
Priceline has skyrocketed 30 percent in the past 12 months, hitting an all-time intraday high of $1,664.99 as recently as Feb. 23.
In its third-quarter earnings report, Priceline said its restaurant booking site OpenTable would pare back its growth strategy. As a result, the company said its earnings were negatively impacted by a $941 million impairment charge due to a slower expansion strategy at OpenTable.
""While OpenTable will continue to pursue ... growth opportunities, they will do so on a more measured and deliberate basis,"" Priceline said in a statement.
Earlier this month, shares of competitor TripAdvisor shed more than 10 percent after reporting revenue that missed analyst expectations.

 The hotel industry in the United States is going after travel websites like Expedia and Priceline, according to documents seen by Bloomberg.
 Shares of Expedia and Priceline closed slightly negative on Friday. Trivago's stock closed down more than 1 percent.
The American Hotel & Lodging Association, which counts Marriott and Hyatt as members, believes that the booking companies are monopolistic, and is looking to lobby against them.  
 ""We have publicly opposed such consolidation with the Justice Department and outlined how the Expedia and Priceline duopoly hurts consumer choice and the small businesses in our industry, which represent some 60 percent of all the hotels in the U.S., who are struggling to compete as a result of the gouging commission rates charged by the [online travel agencies],"" the American Hotel & Lodging Association said.

 According to Bloomberg, the documents said potential marketing for the hotel group's effort could have a Monopoly game theme featuring Expedia and Priceline ""to better underscore that the individual companies are really owned only by two major players."" 
The American Hotel & Lodging Association also pushed for lawmakers to pass the Stop Online Booking Scams Act, which was introduced last year and would require third-party travel sites to disclose to customers that they aren't actually the hotels' websites. The group says such websites can be deceptive, resulting in ""lost reservations, extra charges or alternative accommodations.""
""Listing on our platforms is completely optional and free,"" a spokeswoman for the Priceline Group, Leslie Cafferty, told CNBC.
Sarah Gavin, vice president of communications at Expedia, told CNBC that the company plays ""a small part"" in the travel market. 
As of Friday's close, shares of Expedia are up nearly 24 percent year-to-date, while Priceline shares rose nearly 30 percent in the same period.
