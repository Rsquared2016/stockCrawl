 Think Time Warner deal will go through: Rivada Networks CEO   
 6:18  AM ET Wed,  1 March 2017 |  03:40 
 A $15 billion spectrum contract currently favored to be awarded to AT&T could impact its bid for Time Warner. That's according to Declan Ganley, the CEO of Rivada Networks, who says ""it is hard to imagine the so-called 'FirstNet' contract not being an issue for the Federal Communications Commission.""
 FirstNet is the authority, created by Congress, tasked with building the first high-speed wireless broadband network in the United States dedicated to public safety providers such as police and firefighters.
Unlike other spectrum allocations, this is the first to allow one operator a uniform block in all 56 U.S. states and territories.
 Rivada Mercury, a consortium including Rivada, Intel and network giants Ericsson, Nokia and Fujitsu, had been in the bidding for the FirstNet contract against AT&T.
But Rivada Mercury was excluded from the selection process leaving AT&T as the only company in the running for the contract at the end of 2016. Rivada has sued the U.S. government for what it says is its ""wrongful exclusion.""

 The U.S. Court of Federal Claims in Washington will hear oral arguments in this case today.
""I believe that we will end up winning the case and ultimately the FirstNet contract to roll out the nationwide public safety broadband network,"" Ganley said.
The contract will give the winner 20 megahertz of spectrum in the low band space and is considered premium; often being described as the equivalent of ""beachfront property"" in real-estate terms.
According to some expert analysts, including those at Wells Fargo and UBS, the value of the FirstNet contract in spectrum terms is about $8 billion based on current auction prices. This comes with up to $7 billion in funding from FirstNet to help deploy and operate the network.
The spectrum for allocation is 13 percent of the total low band availability in the United States, which added to the 34 percent already owned by AT&T, would give it control of almost half the market.
Analysts at Wells Fargo have said the contract would be ""very positive"" for AT&T's stock.
At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai told CNBC ""there is currently no reason for the AT&T-Time Warner deal to be reviewed.""
When asked whether the FirstNet contract could change his mind he said: ""I couldn't comment on anything that could alter the analysis of a merger review.""
John Hodulik, a managing director at UBS and industry expert, said: ""I don't think a FirstNet win would change that fact, despite the spectrum holding it would give AT&T.""
He added that if the Department of Justice decides to block the deal, the ""spectrum holdings won't be the issue.""
The AT&T Entertainment Group CEO John Stankey told CNBC that the Time Warner acquisition would give the network giant an important holding of intellectual property.
Stankey added that ""content models were changing so rapidly that IP was essential to be able to innovate in the advertising space and innovate with monetization.""
Commenting on the FirstNet contract, Stankey said that AT&T was ""anxious"" to hear about the decision and said the company is ""ready to go if we're fortunate enough to be awarded that business.""

6,2017-05-31,Time Warner CEO: Net regulations unfairly favor Google and Facebook  ,"Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Jeffrey 'Jeff' Bewkes, chairman and chief executive officer of Time Warner Inc.
 Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said Wednesday that existing U.S. regulations covering internet content unfairly favor Facebook and Google and that his company agreed to be acquired by AT&T to better compete with those technology giants.
""You have the FCC putting regulations on cable and telco companies, you have the FTC putting regulations on Facebook that are much more lax. I'd like to see it be even,"" Bewkes said in response to a question about so-called Net Neutrality rules during an onstage interview at the Code Conference in Ranch Palos Verdes, California. 
 Time Warner last year agreed to be acquired by AT&T for $85 billion in a deal that will provide the wireless giant with a stable of news and entertainment content while giving Time Warner new ways of distributing its shows.
AT&T will also get valuable data on its end users, which Bewkes says it needs to better compete for advertising dollars amid stiffer competition from the tech industry.
""We're increasingly competing with West Coast global businesses that want to get in the video business,"" Bewkes told the gathering of tech executives.
Google's YouTube unit now hosts one billion hours of video viewing per day, CEO Sundar Pichai told Wall Street analysts in April, during a conference call to discuss the first-quarter earnings of its parent company, Alphabet.
Facebook is also making a bigger push into video and is reportedly getting ready to roll out its own original shows sometime in June.
Those two Silicon Valley giants accounted for 85 percent of the growth in digital advertising spending last year, according to an annual report on the Internet presented at the conference earlier Wednesday from Mary Meeker, a partner with venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins.
To garner a bigger chunk of that growth, Time Warner needs better data on those who watch its networks, including CNN, HBO, Showtime and Comedy Central.
""We're trying to get more data, to compete more effectively with a much bigger set of data that the digital companies have,"" Bewkes said.
The mega-merger, which Bewkes said is ""good for America,"" is expected to close this year after FCC Chair Ajit Pai said in February the agency doesn't expect to review it.
Cable and telecom companies, including AT&T, have in the past argued against the net neutrality rules enacted two years ago under former FCC chair Tom Wheeler, saying that they unfairly favor firms that use lots of network traffic.
Those rules prevent internet service providers from favoring or discriminating against network traffic from any particular provider, such as Google, Facebook or Netflix. Industry watchers widely expect those rules to be undone by the FCC, which now has a Republican majority.

 Time Warner just handed Snapchat a $100 million lifeline   
 2:07  PM ET Mon, 19 June 2017 |  00:32 
 Shares of Snap snapped back to life on Monday after the announcement of a new deal with Time Warner.
 Time Warner will make shows such as scripted dramas and comedies for the ephemeral messaging and augmented reality platform. Snapchat will also get ads from HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. over the next two years, the companies said in a statement.
The deal is valued at $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter. The Wall Street Journal, which previously reported the news, said that talent like Ellen DeGeneres and Samantha Bee could be part of the arrangement.
 The number of shows each day on Snapchat will grow from one per day to three per day by the end of this year, the companies said.
""This partnership is another exciting step as we continue to branch out into new genres, including scripted dramas, comedies, daily news shows, documentaries and beyond,""  Nick Bell, vice president of content for Snap, said in a statement.
Snap shares rose about 3 percent, breaking above $18 a share mid-day Monday. Shares of the company closed at their IPO price of $17 a share on Thursday, after struggling to gain traction in the markets after March's public offering.

 The Time Warner-AT&T merger could close within 60 days, sources close to the deal told CNBC Thursday. 
 Some speculated that President Donald Trump might try to stop the deal because of his feud with CNN, whose parent company is Time Warner.
In October, AT&T reached an agreement to buy Time Warner for more than $85 billion. 
 Time Warner shares gained 1 percent following the report.

11,2017-07-14,AT&T CEO Stephenson: 'I'll still be CEO' after Time Warner acquisition  ,"Peter Larsen | CNBC
Randall Stephenson
 AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told CNBC he won't be changing his title after the telecom giant completes its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner.
 Stephenson wrote in an email to ""Squawk Box"" host Joe Kernen that a Bloomberg article saying he will become executive chairman after the combination is ""full of speculation.""
""I will not be changing my title,"" Stephenson added. ""I'll still be CEO.""
 On Friday, a Bloomberg report said Stephenson would become executive chairman after the merger with Time Warner. The report also said Stephenson would oversee a pair of CEOs who would independently manage the combined company's telecommunications and media businesses.
Stephenson did not address any other aspect of the report with CNBC.
However, sources told CNBC's David Faber that Bloomberg's reporting is largely accurate about the leadership structure, but perhaps didn't get the titles right.
The Wall Street Journal also reports that AT&T plans to separate its telecom operations from its media assets after the deal closes.
AT&T executive John Stankey will be in charge on the media side, while the telecom side will be run by John Donovan, another AT&T veteran, according to the Journal and Bloomberg.
Multiple sources told Faber that current Time Warner Chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes will be moving on within a year of the merger's closing.
Bewkes told CNBC in October 2016, when the move was first announced, he planned to stay at the new company for one or two years.
The deal, which has been under regulatory review, is expected to close before year-end, and perhaps as soon as mid-September, people close to the deal told Faber.
In February, Stephenson told CNBC the ""one-track"" Justice Department review should not delay the original timetable for closing the deal.
Donald Trump, while on the presidential campaign trail last year, vowed to block the deal. Time Warner owns CNN, which Trump frequently criticizes as ""fake news.""
But as president, Trump's position is unclear.

 More than 600 gigabytes of files left unsecured on an Amazon server by third-party communications company BroadSoft were leaked last month.
 The four million Time Warner Cable records contain the personal details of its customers, and include usernames, email addresses and financial transaction information,  according to Gizmodo.
""Certain non-financial information of legacy Time Warner Cable customers who used the MyTWC app became potentially visible by external sources,"" Time Warner Cable parent Charter Communications said in a statement to CNBC.
 Charter clarified that once the unlocked server was discovered, Broadsoft immediately removed the information and began a joint investigation into the incident. More sensitive customer information, such as credit card information or Social Security numbers, was not apparently compromised in the leak, the Gizmodo report said.
""There is no indication that any Charter systems were impacted,"" Charter said.
Shares of Charter declined less than half a percent in midday trading Friday, to $396.83 per share.

 AT&T misses on earnings expectations   
 5:34  PM ET Tue, 24 Oct 2017 |  00:37 
 AT&T reported quarterly earnings and revenue that came in just shy of analysts' expectations on Tuesday.
 Here's how the company did:
 EPS: 74 cents vs. 75 cents expected, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $39.67 billion vs. $40.10 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters Wireless net adds: 3.0 million vs. 1.97 million expected, according to StreetAccount Mobility postpaid churn rate: 0.84 percent vs. 1.08 percent expected, according to Street Account 
 In the year-ago quarter, the mobile giant reported adjusted earnings of 74 cents on $40.89 billion in revenue.
The postpaid churn rate, or the percentage of subscribers who cancel their service, was 0.84 percent for the quarter. The total was lower, therefore better, than Wall Street's expectation of 1.08 percent, according to StreetAccount.
Although earnings and revenue came in slightly below Wall Street expectations, AT&T maintained its full-year guidance. Analysts project that AT&T will report full-year earnings of $2.93 per share on $160.86 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.
After the report, shares of AT&T slipped 1 percent in after-hours trade.
On Monday, AT&T extended its deadline to close its proposed acquisition of Time Warner amid pending regulatory approval.
The two corporations reached an $85 billion agreement in October 2016, giving themselves a year to close the deal. The original deadline was Oct. 22.

 Justice Department may sue to block AT&T-Time Warner deal: Dow Jones   
 10:57  AM ET Thu,  2 Nov 2017 |  03:20 
 Time Warner shares fell Thursday after a newspaper reported that the Department of Justice is considering an antitrust lawsuit to block AT&T's acquisition of the media company.
 Time Warner share price was down 4.1 percent after The Wall Street Journal reported that the department's antitrust division is preparing for litigation in case it decides to sue to block the deal. AT&T's stock was down 1.2 percent.
At the same time, the department and the companies are discussing possible terms that would allow the deal to receive the government's approval, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
 AT&T representatives have met with Justice officials in recent weeks, and the department hasn't made a final decision, but the two sides aren't close to an agreement, the Journal's sources said. 
""When the DOJ reviews any transaction, it is common and expected for both sides to prepare for all possible scenarios,"" AT&T said in a statement. ""For over 40 years, vertical mergers like this one have always been approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitors from the market. While we won't comment on our discussions with DOJ, we see no reason in the law or the facts why this transaction should be an exception.""
Time Warner and the Department of Justice declined comment. 
AT&T reached an agreement tobuy Time Warner for more than $85 billion last October. In July, sources told CNBC the deal could close in as soon as 60 days.

 AT&T CEO says he has not offered CNN sale to DOJ   
 4:39  PM ET Wed,  8 Nov 2017 |  03:59 
 AT&T has ""no intention"" of selling CNN despite the Justice Department's demand the company sell it in order to approve the Time Warner acquisition, according to CEO and chairman Randall Stephenson.
 ""Until now, we've never commented on our discussions with the DOJ,"" Stephenson said in a statement. ""But given DOJ's statement this afternoon, it's important to set the record straight. Throughout this process, I have never offered to sell CNN and have no intention of doing so.""
Sources told CNBC that the Justice Department wants AT&T to sell Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, or DirecTV as condition for approval of the $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner deal.
 In addition, DOJ sources told NBC News AT&T offered selling CNN during a meeting on Monday regarding the proposed merger. The DOJ's Antitrust Division ""flatly rejected it"" because it would not solve potential anti-competition issues. Justice Department officials told NBC News there are multiple ways to solve issues regarding the AT&T-Time Warner deal, but selling CNN would not resolve concerns.
""The Department is committed to carrying out its duties in accordance with the laws and the facts,"" a DOJ spokesperson said in response to Stephenson's statement. ""Beyond that, the Department does not comment on any pending investigation.""
Time Warner shares were down 6 percent after the reports. AT&T's stock was up 1 percent.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized CNN as fake news on his social media Twitter account in the past year.

 The company previously said it expected the deal to close by the end of 2017.
When asked about the deal earlier Wednesday at the Wells Fargo Media and Telecom Conference in New York, AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said:
""We are in active discussions with the [Department of Justice]. Those are continuing on. I can't comment on those discussions, but with those discussions, I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain.""
Stephens said the AT&T acquisition of Time Warner is a ""vertical integration"" merger across industries. He noted that the government has not blocked a ""vertical"" deal in more than 40 years.
AT&T announced the cash and stock deal to acquire Time Warner in October 2016. 
Time Warner shares dropped 4 percent on Nov. 2 after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department's antitrust division was preparing for litigation in case it decided to sue to block the deal.
The Financial Times first reported on Wednesday that the Justice Department told AT&T and Time Warner it must sell CNN. The New York Times later reported that either CNN or DirecTV must be sold.

 DOJ demands AT&T sell CNN for Time Warner acquisition approval, FT reports   
 2:18  PM ET Wed,  8 Nov 2017 |  04:16 
 Update: AT&T CEO and chairman Randall Stephenson said he has ""no intention"" of selling CNN despite the Justice Department's request. Read more here. 
 Time Warner shares were down 6 percent Wednesday after the Justice Department demanded that CNN's parent be sold before a merger with AT&T can be approved.
CNBC confirmed the Justice Department's demand that Turner Broadcasting or DirecTV be sold before approval of the $85 billion merger. 
 AT&T's stock price was up slightly.
Earlier Wednesday, AT&T's chief financial officer John Stephens said the timing of the deal was ""now uncertain.""
President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized CNN as fake news in the past year.

 Stephens spoke about the negotiations with the government at a conference Wednesday morning.
""We are in active discussions with the [Department of Justice]. Those are continuing on. I can't comment on those discussions, but with those discussions, I can now say that the timing of the closing of the deal is now uncertain,"" he said, according to a FactSet transcript. ""With regards to the transaction, everything continues as we've expressed in the past.""
The AT&T executive spoke at the Wells Fargo Media & Telecom Conference in New York. The company previously guided for the deal to close by the end of 2017.
Stephens noted the AT&T acquisition of Time Warner is a ""vertical integration"" merger across industries. He cited how the government has not blocked a ""vertical"" deal in more than 40 years.
AT&T announced an agreement to acquire Time Warner in October 2016 for a cash and stock deal valued at more than $85 billion. 
Time Warner shares dropped 4 percent on Nov. 2 after The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department's antitrust division is preparing for litigation in case it decides to sue to block the deal.
Time Warner declined comment on the development. 
The FT first reported the Justice Department told AT&T it must sell CNN and later the New York Times reported either CNN or DirecTV must be sold.

 The DOJ's AT&T-Time Warner case is political: Bibb   
 7:01  PM ET Wed,  8 Nov 2017 |  04:28 
 Antitrust lawyers were scratching their heads Wednesday over published reports that the Justice Department is insisting that AT&T sell its CNN cable network, or its DirecTV satellite television unit, if it wants to win approval to buy Time Warner.
 ""If that is indeed the case, to me it would seem to be at least a break in recent precedent,"" Kevin Arquit, co-head of the antitrust practice at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, told CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""
Government opposition to mega-mergers like the proposed $85.4 billion AT&T-Time Warner deal usually center on concerns that they will reduce competition and raise prices for consumers. The move would combine Time Warner's vast collection of content, from movies to cable TV networks, with AT&T's sprawling network of cable, satellite and phone subscribers.
 But antitrust lawyers said that, in recent years, the remedy for those concerns in media industry mergers has been a consent decree with the acquiring company promising not to engage in anti-competitive behavior.
""The Department is committed to carrying out its duties in accordance with the laws and the facts,"" a Justice Department spokesman told CNBC. ""Beyond that, the Department does not comment on any pending investigation.""
The government's reported divestiture demands came as a surprise to investors, who sent Time Warner shares down more than 6 percent on fears the deal might not go through. AT&T's stock rose more than 1 percent.

 AT&T CEO says he has not offered CNN sale to DOJ   
 4:39  PM ET Wed,  8 Nov 2017 |  03:59 
 AT&T was apparently expecting the deal to go through without complications, saying previously that it expected the acquisition to close by the end of this year.
""Until now, we've never commented on our discussions with the DOJ,"" Randall Stephenson, AT&T's chairman and CEO, said in a statement. ""But given DOJ's statement this afternoon, it's important to set the record straight. Throughout this process, I have never offered to sell CNN and have no intention of doing so.""
The surprise stemmed in part from comments last year from the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, who said in a TV interview shortly after the deal was announced that he did not view AT&T's plan to buy Time Warner as ""a major antitrust problem.""
Delrahim was nominated by President Donald Trump to head the Justice Department's antitrust division and confirmed in September.
Delrahim, a former attorney and registered lobbyist, has expertise in media industry mergers. He was registered as a lobbyist for Comcast in 2009 and 2010, before Comcast's deal to buy NBC Universal, and was registered as a lobbyist for AT&T in 2007, according to opensecrets.org.
Thursday's reports also touched off speculation that the Justice Department's insistence on a divestiture could have political overtones, after Trump's outspoken criticism of CNN's coverage of his administration. Trump accused CNN and other media outlets of unfair coverage. Last year on the campaign trail, Trump, criticized the proposed AT&T-Time Warner deal and vowed that as president his Justice Department would block it.
""To have at the 11th hour this, you know, this development is troubling,"" Adonis Hoffman, former chief of staff and senior legal advisor to the FCC commissioner, told ""Closing Bell.""
""We know that the president has had problems with CNN,"" he said. ""Based on the CNN reporting, that's understandable. But the fact that this is a vertical merger with very little competitive impact would seem to me that there would be a green light on the regulatory front.""

 Cramer Remix: Why an AT&T-Time Warner combo would be worth buying   
 9:48  PM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  00:59 
 The increasingly complicated deal talks between AT&T, Time Warner and the Department of Justice didn't stop CNBC's Jim Cramer from being bullish on the potential merger.
 ""The combined companies actually have better cash flow than if you break them up,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said during a special Veterans Day show at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. ""But [in] either case, AT&T represents a bedrock institution that has a lot of cash flow. I've been recommending it. It's got a 5 percent yield. I think it can go higher.""
Cramer added that, if AT&T were to merge with Time Warner, the combined entity's dividend would be safer than if they remained separate companies.
 ""I want the deal to go through because I think the combined companies would be terrific, but I'm not against it, particularly for income,"" Cramer said.
 Leadership characteristics
 David A. Grogan | CNBC
Jim Cramer on the campus of West Point on Nov. 9th, 2017.
 Cramer has noticed that some folks on Wall Street find it difficult to reconcile how veterans relate to the world of business.
""I think there is some commonality, because leading an enterprise these days is all about the same processes that cadets learn here,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said at West Point.
""No wonder veterans do so well in business,"" he continued. ""A winning strategy is a winning strategy — doesn't matter whether you're talking about the military or the private sector.""
On a difficult day for the major averages, which slid on reports of a Senate Republican proposal to push tax reform back to 2019, Cramer thought it was important to note some key traits often taught to the military that have helped executives lead their companies through hard times.
 Johnson & Johnson CEO on tax reform
 Adam Jeffery | CNBC 
Alex Gorsky on Mad Money.
 The government must collaborate with businesses if it wants to solve some of society's most pressing problems, Johnson & Johnson Chairman and CEO Alex Gorsky told CNBC on Thursday.
""It takes all of us working together,"" Gorsky, a West Point graduate, told Cramer. ""If we're going to solve issues like health care, if we're going to take on issues about how do we grow our economy, how do we create more high-paying jobs, that requires industry and the government working together.""
Gorsky also spoke to tax reform, which The Washington Post reported on Thursday was facing competing bills from Senate and House Republicans.
 Cramer's top cybersecurity picks
 Mary Catherine Wellons | CNBC 
Mark McLaughlin, president and CEO of Palo Alto Networks.
 Cramer knows that the cybersecurity industry isn't going anywhere but up anytime soon.
""Cybersecurity is, unfortunately, a secular growth business, meaning that long term, hackers and digital terrorists [are] going to keep trying to steal our data and mess up our systems,"" he said. ""That's why I think it's worth circling back to the companies that combat this stuff, especially since the whole cohort pulled back today, so it's a good opportunity. When a secular growth group pulls back, you need to use the weakness to dip your toe in the water.""
Cramer started with Mimecast, a cloud-based data security company that came public less than two years ago. With shares up 72 percent so far in 2017, Mimecast specializes in protecting employees' email accounts at large companies.
Emails may not sound like the most exciting medium for mitigating cyberattacks, but it's anything but stale: in September, Mimecast's CEO told Cramer that hackers are increasingly realizing that humans, not computers, are the ""weakest links"" when it comes to breaches.
 Hiring veterans
 Finally, in honor of the special Veterans Day program, Cramer highlighted why some of the world's top companies have made the pledge to hire more veterans.
""Allow me to put this in money-making terms: If you're running a business, people with military backgrounds make fabulous employees — disciplined, smart, highly trained, think on their feet, able to handle high-pressure situations. But beyond that, what I've seen in my long history as an investor and in interviewing CEOs is that veterans make great executives,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
From Verizon to Hilton Worldwide to Amazon, Boeing and the major banks, scores of companies have vowed to add more veterans to their ranks, and Cramer said that they deserve accolades and respect for their commitments.
""We do not spend enough time talking about leadership in this business, but it's a huge component of what makes companies successful, which is why some of the best chief executives I've ever had the good fortune to meet were veterans,"" Cramer concluded.
 Lightning Round: KO's not fizzling out long term
 In Cramer's lightning round, he zoomed through his take on some cadets' favorite stocks:
Coca-Cola: ""For long term, yes. For long term, they've got a good CEO. He's doing a lot. My problem with Coca-Cola is that my kids would say, 'Dad, it's so bad for you, I'm not going to have it.' They need to diversify and get something else going, but I think this new man at Coca-Cola is doing a good job.""
CVS Health: ""I think this one is dramatically oversold. I think people are too worried about Amazon. I think it's a well-run company. If they make an acquisition that is in managed care, the stock is going to go higher. I like CVS.""

 AT&T, Time Warner deal under pressure from Justice Department: Wells Fargo analyst   
 6:42  AM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  03:16 
 AT&T and the Justice Department could be on their way to a major court battle, which one analyst believes the company stands a strong chance of winning.
 The fight centers on AT&T's hopes to acquire Time Warner and news Wednesday that the government wants the company to first sell Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, or sell DirecTV. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the company has no intentions of divesting itself of those holdings.
Paul Gallant, a Washington analyst at Cowen Research, thinks the company won't have to.
 ""If this does go to court, we think AT&T holds a strong position and would likely prevail,"" Cowen said Thursday in a note to clients.
The company has three advantages, according to Gallant: The deal is ""vertical"" so it would be difficult to prove harm to the marketplace as it does not eliminate a rival; the DOJ would bear the burden of proof that the deal is anti-competitive; and the department's earlier attempts to negotiate behavioral conditions for approval indicate that it knows a legal case isn't strong.

 Gallant compared the saber-rattling over the Turner properties to President Donald Trump's earlier threat to pull the broadcasting license of CNBC-parent NBC over what he deemed as unfair news coverage.
Trump has a notoriously contentious relationship with CNN, which he often takes to task for ""fake news.""
""We think AT&T's merger approval chances would be further improved if there's meaningful criticism in the coming days of Trump possibly using antitrust law to target CNN, and either the president or DOJ decide a court challenge isn't worth it, especially with DOJ likely to lose the court case,"" Gallant wrote.
The deal is valued at $85 billion and had been expected to close by the end of the year. Sources have told NBC News that AT&T previously had offered to sell off CNN, but was told that won't be enough. 
The DOJ said it does not comment on ongoing matters and has declined comment on the AT&T-Time Warner deal as well. 
""The Department is committed to carrying out its duties in accordance with the laws and the facts,"" it said in statement. ""Beyond that, the Department does not comment on any pending investigation.""
Later, a government official familiar with the discussions told CNBC that the DOJ presented AT&T with several options by which it might be willing to satisfy antitrust concerns, but never demanded a CNN sale.
AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment.
While seeing the department's case as weak, Gallant said the potential for a court battle could extend the timeline for closing. 
""While we view the DoJ's position as at least partially politically motivated, they do have the power to at least elongate the acquisition process,"" he said. ""Deal risk has clearly gone up.""

 AT&T's Time Warner bid hits snag   
 11:27  AM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  02:11 
 AT&T would likely be ""a pitiful, helpless giant"" without its $85 billion merger with Time Warner, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.
 Cramer spoke a day after the Justice Department demanded that AT&T sell Turner Broadcasting, which includes CNN, or sell DirecTV, as a condition for approval of the deal.
Cramer said the Justice Department ""thesis"" about the deal is flawed.
 ""This has got to be one of the more arbitrary and capricious potential prosecutions I've seen,"" Cramer said.
""I think the Justice Department is trying to create some sort of thesis that this is some sort of colossus,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""Give me a break.""
Some commentators questioned whether the Justice Department's demand was political because President Donald Trump has frequently criticized CNN for its coverage.
AT&T chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson said in a statement he has never offered to sell CNN and does not have any intention of doing so.
Cramer was also perplexed why the Justice Department would want AT&T to sell DirecTV: ""I mean where is the antitrust there?""
""One guy has NFL and the other is the beginning part of March Madness. I mean I don't get that,""  the host of CNBC's ""Mad Money"" said.

 Government official tells CNBC that AT&T’s CEO offered sale of CNN   
 2:20  PM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  02:47 
 The Justice Department pushed back Thursday on allegations that it is trying to get AT&T to sell CNN and other properties as part of its plans to acquire Time Warner. In another strange twist to the deal, AT&T's CEO backed up that account. 
 Instead, the DOJ presented AT&T with several options by which it might be willing to satisfy antitrust concerns, but never demanded a CNN sale, a government official familiar with the discussions told CNBC.
The official called the accusation that the government was trying to force a CNN sale ""shocking"" and countered that AT&T was attempting to make the matter political.
 ""They're trying to make this a political issue. It's not,"" the official said.
The government suggested that AT&T sell either Turner, which owns CNN, or Direct TV, the official added.
In an unusual back and forth played out in the media, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said the company would not consider divesting CNN. Stephenson himself gave credence to Thursday's statements out of the DOJ.
""I have never been told that the price of getting the deal done was selling CNN,"" Stephenson said at the DealBook conference in New York.
Sources had told CNBC that the government had demanded a sale of the Turner properties or Direct TV to approve of the deal.
The Justice official said the department would prefer that AT&T abandon the deal altogether. Failing that, the department would like to see a sale of either Turner or Direct TV — but also is open to other ideas that would satisfy antitrust concerns.

 AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson: 'I have never been told that the price of getting a deal done was selling CNN'   
 1:38  PM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  02:19 
 AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson insisted on Thursday that the company was not told it had to sell CNN in order to get approval for its merger with Time Warner.
 ""I have never been told that the price of getting the deal done was selling CNN, period. And likewise I have never offered to sell CNN,"" he said. ""There is absolutely no intention that we would ever sell CNN."" 
Stephenson spoke at The New York Times DealBook Conference in New York City on Thursday.
 Stephenson's comments came a day after the finger-pointing over whether the Justice Department demanded as a condition of approving AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner that CNN parent Turner Broadcasting or Direct TV be sold off. 
Time Warner owns Turner Broadcasting. AT&T owns Direct TV.
The Justice Department pushed back Thursday on allegations it is trying to get AT&T to sell CNN and other properties. Instead, the DOJ presented AT&T with several options by which it might be willing to satisfy antitrust concerns, but never demanded a CNN sale, a government official familiar with the discussions told CNBC.
Stephenson said selling CNN goes against one of the key things AT&T is trying to accomplish with the merger — boosting its advertising capability.
""There is a lot of information and data that we think can be used to stand up a new advertising business. Pairing that with the Turner advertising inventory is a really powerful thing, we believe. That is what we aspire to do. Selling CNN makes no sense in that context,"" he said.
While Stephenson was emphatic about not selling CNN, he refused to say whether Direct TV was a subject of discussion with the DOJ.
Instead, he stressed the ""confidential"" nature of the negotiations.
Meanwhile, if the issue did head to court, Stephenson said his team is prepared.
""We have been working very diligently on a litigation strategy and a litigation plan,"" he said. ""If we get to a place, we'll have to ask ourselves — is a negotiated settlement a better or worse outcome than if we litigate. If we feel like litigation is a better outcome, then we will litigate.""

President Donald Trump listens to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson during the 'American Leadership in Emerging Technology' event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on Thursday, June 22, 2017.
 AT&T will seek access to communications between the White House and Justice Department about the Time Warner deal if the government sues to block the $85 billion takeover, Bloomberg reports, citing sources.
 The two companies declined to comment on the report. Representatives from both the White House and Department of Justice denied they had communicated about the deal.
""No one from the White House instructed me as to this or any other transaction within the Antitrust Division's authority,"" Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for antitrust, said in a statement relayed to CNBC by the White House. 
 ""The President did not speak with the Attorney General about this matter, and no White House official was authorized to speak with the Department of Justice on this matter,"" Raj Shah, White House principal deputy press secretary, said in a separate statement.
AT&T announced the takeover last fall, but the deal has yet to close. Last week, reports alleged that in order for the Justice Department to approve the sale, CNN would have to be sold. Critics have said the White House weighed in against the deal, noting that President Donald Trump has often tweeted his criticism of CNN as a purveyor of fake news.
The Justice Department has pushed back on the allegation it would require the sale of CNN. A government official familiar with the discussions told CNBC that in order for the deal to go through, the Justice Department has suggested AT&T sell its subsidiary DirecTV or Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting unit, which owns CNN. 
AT&T CEO and Chairman Randall Stephenson also said in a statement last week the company has ""no intention"" of selling CNN.

 DOJ fails to secure support from state attorneys general in AT&T fight: Sources   
 2:19  PM ET Wed, 15 Nov 2017 |  01:48 
 The Justice Department is still likely to proceed with a case to block AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner despite failing to secure support from multiple state attorneys general.
 Sources told CNBC that federal officials reached out to 18 state AGs and sent a draft complaint to at least seven of them, but so far no states have committed join the case. The DOJ is still likely to bring one, the sources said.
The $85 billion merger was announced last year but has dragged on as the government reviews it for anti-trust matters.
 CNBC earlier reported last week that the government could sue to block a transaction unless AT&T agrees to sell Turner Broadcasting, owner of the CNN cable news channel, or its DirectTV division. But the Justice Department has pushed back on the idea it is trying to force a sale of either of those assets, and AT&T's CEO has said he has no intention of selling CNN.
Last year, the Justice Department under the Obama administration teamed up with 11 states to challenge Anthem's $54 billion acquisition of Cigna, and with eight states to block Aetna's $37 billion of Humana. Both deals were canceled earlier this year.

 There's a 75% chance of AT&T-Time Warner getting done: Liberty Media's John Malone   
 12:09  PM ET Thu, 16 Nov 2017 |  02:18 
 An AT&T takeover of Time Warner, without a sale of CNN, is still quite likely, media mogul John Malone told CNBC on Thursday. 
 ""I was quite surprised to see that divestiture was proposed or offered,"" Liberty Media Chairman Malone said in an exclusive interview with CNBC's David Faber at the Liberty Media annual investor meeting. 
""Today, I would be 75 percent of it getting done on the current terms, without divestiture,"" Malone said. He said a month ago he would have given the deal ""100 percent probability of getting done with behavioral agreements."" 
 AT&T agreed to buy Time Warner last fall in a massive $85 billion deal. But in the latest challenge for the deal, CNBC reported last week the Department of Justice could sue to block the takeover unless AT&T agrees to sell its DirectTV division or Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting, owner of CNN.
The Justice Department has pushed back on the idea that it is trying to force a sale of either of those assets, while AT&T's CEO has said he has no intention of selling CNN.
""These deals generally get done,"" Malone said. ""Frankly I have not read what the government's case is.""
Malone is widely respected as one of the most astute dealmakers in media and cable. He built and ran his cable empire TCI from the 1970s and sold it to AT&T in 1999 for roughly $50 billion. The investor has a net worth of nearly $8 billion, according to Forbes.

 DOJ argues AT&T-Time Warner deal would harm competition and thwart innovation   
 6:31  AM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 |  01:35 
 The Justice Department's suit against the AT&T's $85 billion merger with Time Warner is not likely to have a broad impact on the stock market, but it could chill activity in the media sector, analysts say.
 The companies said they would fight the lawsuit, which is unusual in that it seeks to halt a vertical merger, meaning the businesses do not directly overlap but do complement each other. The Department of Justice will now have to prove that the combination would be harmful.
""It's not totally shocking. It didn't come completely out of left field,"" said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. ""It is odd in the sense for the market to be dealing in deregulatory environment under a Republican administration and under a Republican-controlled Congress to have this come out. It's just a little odd. It makes you wonder where you really are on the regulatory front.""
 Analysts say the focus on the AT&T, Time Warner deal raises questions about the 21st Century Fox's efforts to sell off its assets, such as its film or television studios. Interested buyers reportedly include Comcast, parent of CNBC, and Disney.
Paulsen said the stock market could respond negatively if it appears that the administration is becoming more aggressive against mergers in general, but for now it's likely to be contained. ""This certainly puts a wet blanket over media deals,"" said Paulsen.
Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at Lindsey Group, said the market has been ignoring negative news on the deal.
""It's a weird time. I'm of the belief the stock market is not the same discounting mechanism it was,"" he said. ""Unless the worry is smack in the middle of their face they don't care. They are thinking about tax reform and everything else pales in comparison… Even if it's a 2018 passage…they're staring at that 20 percent corporate tax rate and they're drooling.""
Paulsen said the DOJ focus on AT&T and Time Warner may be a one off. He said it does raise questions about whether the deal is getting attention because President Donald Trump has said he opposed the deal and because of his sparring on Twitter with Time Warner's cable news network, CNN. As a candidate, Trump said his administration would reject the deal because it put too much power in too few hands.

Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Randall Stephenson (L) and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Time Warner Jeffrey Bewkes listen to testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on the proposed deal between AT&T and Time Warner in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2016.
 AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson told reporters Monday that he has never disagreed so much with the DOJ over basic facts on a deal. The CEO said he did not know whether the objections are about CNN, and that that the companies would not agree to divest the cable news network or give any appearance of compromising the First Amendment.
The Justice Department said the deal harms consumers and stifles innovation. Earlier this month, there were reports that the government had demanded AT&T sell Turner Broadcasting, the operator of CNN, or AT&T's DirectTV as a condition of approval, but the government has pushed back on those reports.
The government also has tried to get state attorneys general to join tis suit but so far none have signed on.
""Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitors from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently,"" said AT&T general counsel David McAtee ,in a statement.
Craig Moffett, founder and analyst with MoffettNathanson, said there are reasons Justice could go after the merger.
""I don't think it's fair to say it's either political or there are no vertical issues because there are,"" he said. AT&T would have leverage against its competitors by owning such programming companies as HBO.
""Perhaps the president approached the DOJ, but let's assume that's not the case,"" said Moffett. ""Here's the reason where it actually could raise prices for consumers. Seventy percent of the country consumes Time Warner content through some platform other than AT&T, and as long as AT&T becomes a supplier to its direct competitors, it has an incentive to raise the price to its direct competitors.""

Jeffrey 'Jeff' Bewkes, chairman and chief executive officer of Time Warner Inc., listens during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2016.
 Shares of Time Warner fell 1.1 percent on Monday on the back of reports that the U.S. government is set to make an antitrust announcement.
 The media company's stock was trading near the flatline before the news hit at about 3:15 p.m. New York time. AT&T shares, which is trying to complete a purchase of Time Warner for $85 billion, jumped about 1 percent before closing 0.4 percent higher.
 NBC News said, citing a source, that the announcement will involve AT&T. Reuters also reported, citing a source, that the Justice Department will sue AT&T to prevent it from buying Time Warner.
AT&T and Time Warner have been seeking regulatory approval to complete the merger. 
Earlier this month, there were allegations that the Justice Department demanded CNN be sold before approving the deal. The government pushed back against this notion, with an official telling CNBC the department just presented AT&T with several options by which it might be willing to satisfy antitrust concerns. It didn't, however, demand a sale of CNN.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters in a briefing that she was not aware of President Donald Trump or anyone at the White House encouraging pushing for the deal to get blocked.

 AT&T/Time Warner deal would give competitors incentive to raise prices: Analyst   
 5:51  PM ET Mon, 20 Nov 2017 |  06:12 
 The Department of Justice is suing to block AT&T's $85 billion deal to buy Time Warner.
 ""Today's DOJ lawsuit is a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrustprecedent,"" said David McAtee, senior executive vice president and general counsel of AT&T, in a statement. ""Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefitconsumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently.""
AT&T has already started a website to make its case for the deal. 
 Time Warner shares began falling into the close on Wednesday as news outlets began reporting the DOJ was planning a major antitrust action after the bell. The department later called the deal ""illegal"" and ""harmful"" to consumers.
The action was sure to stir controversy because of President Donald Trump's adversarial relationship with CNN, which is owned by Time Warner. Trump has repeatedly criticized CNN's reporting, calling it ""fake news.""
Just last week, Trump tweeted: ""While in the Philippines I was forced to watch @CNN, which I have not done in months, and again realized how bad, and FAKE, it is. Loser!""
 TWEET: While in the Philippines I was forced to watch @CNN, which I have not done in months, and again realized how bad, and FAKE, it is. Loser!
 ""That's really the big elephant in the room,"" David Goodfriend, president of Goodfriend Government Affairs, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell,"" referring to Trump's adversarial relationship with CNN. ""If there's politics involved, we'll find out when we see how the Justice Department deals with another big media merger that's pending, and that's the acquisition by Sinclair Broadcasting Group of Tribune Media.""
The DOJ has denied allegations it was blocking this deal to somehow punish the companies for CNN's news coverage and a DOJ official denied that once again on a call with reporters to discuss the lawsuit.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also told reporters in a briefing Monday that she was not aware of President Trump or anyone at the White House encouraging pushing for the deal to get blocked.
The next step for the fate of the merger is in the courts with the DOJ now having to prove that the combination would violate the law. AT&T was quick to point out that the DOJ has not successfully blocked a so-called vertical merger in court in nearly 50 years. Vertical mergers are when two companies on separate positions in the same supply chain combine, in this case content (Time Warner) and media distribution (AT&T).
The DOJ is likely to argue that while it is a mostly vertical merger, the combination would harm consumers by raising costs. Sources told CNBC last week that the Justice Department had reached out to at least 18 state attorneys general to join a case against the deal, but had not found any takers.
""We are confident that the Court will reject the Government's claims and permit this merger under longstanding legal precedent,"" added AT&T's McAtee in the statement.

 Faber on DOJ blocking AT&T/Time Warner merger: DOJ officials are confident they will prevail in court

 The Justice Department sued on Monday to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner, calling it an ""illegal"" combination that harms consumers and stifles innovation, DOJ officials said.
 AT&T and Time Warner announced their $85 billion merger last year, but the closing has been dragged out by the government's antitrust review. 
It is the latest salvo in a drama more than one year in the making. Earlier this month, reports circulated that the government had demanded AT&T sell Turner Broadcasting, operator of the CNN news network, or DirectTV as a condition of approval, though the government pushed back at those reports.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Time Warner Jeffrey Bewkes (L) speaks with Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Randall Stephenson before a Senate Judiciary Committee Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on the proposed deal between AT&T and Time Warner in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2016.
 A Justice Department official told reporters on Monday that the merger would raise prices for consumers and potentially block creators of media content from distributing their product without paying more money. Time Warner owns various networks in addition to CNN, including TBS, TNT and Cartoon Network. It also has lucrative sports broadcasting deals.
The government was also working to get state attorneys general to support a lawsuit, but so far none has signed on, the Justice official said on Monday.
In a statement on Monday, AT&T's general counsel, David McAtee, said, ""Today's DOJ lawsuit is a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent. Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently.""
The lawsuit says the merged company would have the power to make its video distributor rivals less competitive by raising their costs, which would be passed on to consumers. The merged firm could also hinder the growth of online distributors that it sees as a threat to the pay-TV model.
But AT&T's CEO, Randall Stephenson, said during a press conference late Monday the government's argument ""defies logic.""
 The case was filed in a D.C. federal court under the direction of the Justice Department's newly installed antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim. He was only recently confirmed by the Senate and seemed to signal his intentions last week in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington.
Delrahim was critical of the attempts of prior administrations to make ""behavioral remedies"" conditions to approve of big corporate mergers. Such remedies are supposed to create fairness and protect consumers but create extra burdens on regulators, he said. 
The Justice Department has disputed it made the sale of Turner Broadcasting or CNN a condition of approval. A Justice Department official said Monday that the government made a ""good faith"" effort to resolve the harm to competition while allowing significant parts of the deal to move forward. 
Stephenson said during the press conference that a sale of CNN was a ""nonstarter,"" adding that the company was confident it would not have to sell any assets. 
Traders have said in recent days that a government move to block the deal could put a chill on merger activity. So far this year, there have been more than 9,000 mergers announced in the U.S., worth an estimated $1.2 trillion, according to Dealogic. Within the U.S. media sector, there have been 209 deals announced this year for an estimated $32 billion. 
What's missing this year, however, traders said, were the huge deals that characterized 2016.
While the merger market seemed to awaken since Labor Day, ""this could kill it again,"" said Nancy Havens, an event-driven trader who takes bets on stocks of companies before they complete their deals, about Delrahim's stance. ""It makes the future antitrust approval of mergers much more difficult.""
AT&T's Stephenson said as much on the conference call. The lawsuit would have ""nothing but a freezing effect on commerce.""
Justice officials were seen as headed to a lawsuit no matter what. But Delrahim, who has lobbied on behalf of AT&T in the distant past, said in an interview on Canadian television last year he didn't see the deal as having a major antitrust problem. 
Last year the Justice Department under the Obama administration teamed up with 11 states to challenge Anthem's $54 billion acquisition of Cigna, and with eight states to block Aetna's $37 billion of Humana. Both deals were canceled earlier this year.

Pedestrians walk past the Time Warner Center in New York on October 23, 2016.
 There are three important points to make about the complaint that the Justice Department has filed under Section 7 of the Clayton Act to block the AT&T/Time Warner merger: (1) The main theory of the case is relatively straightforward and plausible. (2) Bringing this case into court for litigation may be unusual but is not surprising; and (3) The concern about political influence in making this decision is an unfortunate cost of candidate and President Trump's disregard for the institutions of justice.
 (1) The theory of the case: According to the complaint, Time Warner commands a high price for Turner's very popular networks (TNT, TBS, CNN, and the Cartoon Network). AT&T owns Direct TV, a satellite service, that competes with cable and fiber optic systems in various geographic markets all around the country. The merger will allow AT&T/Time Warner to negotiate for even higher prices for Turner content than Time Warner could before the merger because the merged firm can credibly commit to walking away from a deal if, say, cable company A balks at the price.
Why would it be credible to give up the licensing revenue from company A now, when it wasn't credible before? The theory is that if the merged firm did stop providing Turner programs to company A, the merged firm could convince some of A's customers, who will no longer get Turner networks, to switch to DirectTV, which would be carrying Turner, and that the gain from those switches would be large enough to make the threat to walk away from the table credible.
 What's bad about that behavior? The complaint alleges that company A would give in to the threat, pay AT&T/Time Warner more money for Turner programming, and pass those higher costs (or at least most of them) along to its customers. This means that consumers would be injured. Even if that didn't happen, these competitors of DirectTV would be less able to compete with the merged company because their costs would be higher than DirectTV's. This, too, would be anticompetitive.
Are there possible problems with the government's theories? Of course. A major question is how plausible its economists' estimates are on key parts of its theory: how many of company A's customers would drop their cable subscription without Turner's networks, how many would switch to DirectTV (rather than just cutting the cord), and how profitable would the new customers be.
And would the gain in DirectTV's profits be greater than the loss in licensing revenue that AT&T would suffer if it walked away from the bargaining table without a deal. After all, a credible threat must be a profitable threat. Finally, there is the question whether the price increases that cable companies will end up paying will really amount to ""hundreds of millions of dollars,"" as the government alleges, and how much of that will be passed on to consumers.
But if the government can prove its allegations, then it will have met the standard required in the Clayton Act: proof that the merger's effect ""may be substantially to lessen competition.""
(2) How unusual is this case? Vertical mergers have been subject to the Clayton Act since it was passed in 1914, but the first such case wasn't brought until 1949, involving DuPont's acquisition of GM stock. There was a fair amount of litigation against vertical mergers in the 1960s and 1970s, by the government and by private parties, but litigation declined sharply in 1980s.
More recently, enforcement against vertical mergers has returned, but there has been no litigation in court. Cases have been settled with consent decrees, decrees that many criticized as too weak. So it is not really surprising to see this case being brought. What is more surprising is that the government was unwilling to take a weak settlement, for example, a promise by AT&T not to engage in such negotiating tactics, a promise which would have been difficult to enforce.
(3) The politics of this case have been unfortunate. Political values are important in antitrust, but political pressure on government enforcers undercuts their ability to make professional judgments about enforcement policy. Had this exact case been brought by a Clinton Administration, commentators would have been applauding antitrust enforcers for finally getting serious about vertical mergers and ""just saying no.""
Instead, because of candidate Trump's remarks last October that the merger is ""a deal we will not approve in my administration,"" coupled with his hostility toward Turner-owned CNN, we look at the government enforcers with suspicion. Perhaps that suspicion is warranted, perhaps not. But we are now seeing the cost we pay when our institutions of justice are undermined at the highest levels.

Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Randall Stephenson (L) and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Time Warner Jeffrey Bewkes listen to testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on the proposed deal between AT&T and Time Warner in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2016.
 Strategas Research analyst Dan Clifton says AT&T appears to have failed in its lobbying efforts for its Time Warner deal, and if other deals fail, it could be for the same reason. 
 Clifton, head of Strategas policy research, has set up a proprietary system to evaluate lobbying efforts by companies involved in mergers. 
""The AT&T-Time Warner merger failed to meet the lobbying threshold where deals seem to get approved,"" he notes, adding the situation was ""further complicated by the politics surrounding CNN and the growing antitrust pessimism building on the right and left.""

 DOJ suit could have 'chilling effect' on further media mergers: New Street's Jonathan Chaplin   
 3:51  PM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 |  03:21 
 AT&T has traditionally been successful with lobbying, but it missed the mark this time. Clifton said he uses about a half dozen different metrics in his ratings of potential merger success. ""There is a clear relationship between how many resources these companies are focusing on getting their deal approved and whether that deal gets approved,"" he said.
The Justice Department shot down AT&T's merger with Time Warner and filed suitto block the deal. The companies have vowed to fight the DOJ, which they say is making an unprecedented stand. The AT&T merger is a so-called ""vertical"" deal, linking related assets that complement each other but do not specifically overlap, as in other antitrust situations.
 Source: Strategas Research
The deal has also been opposed by President Donald Trump, who said Tuesday it was not good for the country. Trump first voiced his opposition to the merger when he was still a candidate. 
There were also reports that the DOJ was seeking to have Time Warner dispose of CNN, but government officials have pushed back on that. However, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said while he does not know if CNN was a factor, the companies will not shed the cable news network and will not tolerate the appearance of any assault on the First Amendment, which guarantees freedom of the press.
Clifton said his work shows that the $66 billion proposed Monsanto/Bayer AG merger should go through based on lobbying efforts. But he notes that the deal, under scrutiny in Europe and the U.S., is trading about $10 below the $128 offer price, possibly showing some doubt.
""Monsanto has made the investment,"" he said.
But deals where the spread is tight look more likely to succeed. Those include Calpine, which received a $15.25 offer from Energy Capital Partners. The spread between the offer price and market price is less than 2 percent away from the deal price. Announced deals between Northrop Grumman and Orbital, and Deltic Timber and Potlatch also have spreads of less than 2 percent beween the market price and the offer price.
""We're trying to capture how many resources they're putting into the deal approval relative to the size of the deal. Those companies that have a seat at the table are going to know what concessions they need to make,"" Clifton said. ""There are some companies that try to do a merger and they have zero lobbying associated with it. When you're doing a large deal, you have to have skin in the game on the lobbying front.""
Update: This version clarifies that Monsanto's merger with Bayer AG appears like it would be approved based on Strategas' lobbying study.

Randall Stephenson
 Now that the Justice Department has sued to block the $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner merger and AT&T has vowed to fight it in court, we've learned two things for sure:
 AT&T doesn't know a real gift when it sees one. And AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson should probably stop talking so much if he doesn't want to bring more scrutiny to the industry and its constantly rising cable bills. 
The official reasons the DOJ gave for its decision were that the deal will harm consumers with higher prices and potentially stifle innovation. But the growing suspicion is that President Donald Trump's continuing feud with Time Warner asset CNN is behind the effort to block the deal until AT&T agrees to sell off CNN first.
 That suspicion gained some traction today with the news that the Justice Department's new antitrust chief, Mark Delrahim, didn't voice any real objections to this same merger deal a year ago.
Despite that, the administration is denying any singling out of this deal for political reasons connected to CNN. Of course, President Trump himself has done little lately to avoid the appearance of personal anger at the news channel:
 Trump cnn tweet
 This is where AT&T continues to be missing a major opportunity. If AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson really believes what he said Monday about how the government's move ""defies logic,"" then this move really is about CNN. And selling CNN for a decent price, when the network is riding a relative ratings high, might be easier now than it has been in many years. Potential buyers include  Comcast (parent company of CNBC), Verizon, Disney, Bloomberg, Sinclair, CBS,  and Hearst. According to Wells Fargo analyst Marci Rykvicker and Reuters Breaking Views, CNN could be worth as much as $10 billion. 
CNN's recent rise is very much connected to the Trump presidency and the unique viewer interest in all things connected to this White House. But even if he's re-elected, Donald Trump won't be in office forever. This very well might be a temporary high for CNN and AT&T would be foolish not to consider that, antitrust issues or not. 
Of course, those who believe that AT&T caving to real or imagined Trump administration pressure to sell a news channel is a chilling development for the First Amendment have a point. But selling off CNN and having the network silenced are two different things and should be viewed in that less dire context. 
AT&T shareholders probably have a different set of priorities. If the merger will otherwise drive prices and profits up for combined AT&T and Time Warner assets, why not call the government's bluff and sell off CNN now and reap those benefits instead? 
Many experts believe that feud or no feud, there is something to the official DOJ objection to the AT&T-Time Warner combination. Craig Moffett, founder and analyst with MoffettNathanson, told CNBC Monday that the deal could easily lead to higher prices, especially for customers of Time Warner's HBO networks and programming.
And that's where Stephenson and his public comments come in. The AT&T CEO is treading on thin ice by claiming there's no logic in blocking the deal. He might be right that the DOJ under both parties hasn't blocked similar cable content and service provider mergers in the past. But many consumer groups consider that a problem that needs to be rectified by nixing this deal, not a justification for it. Cable TV subscription prices are going up and have been for a long time in what Consumer Reports calls an ""annual tradition."" The Consumers Union first noted the correlation of mergers to higher prices back in a 2003 report, and others have followed suit right up to this year with complaints about the repercussions of the Charter-Time Warner Cable deal.
CEOs are usually smart enough to steer clear of playing politics. Perhaps Stephenson believes he'll get some kind of political public relations boost by standing up to an administration that remains under serious fire. But on that level, he has less to gain than he has to lose.
He can still backtrack and avoid a costly legal battle that might end up in more problems for him and the entire industry than just the nixing of one big deal. The last thing AT&T and its peers need is extra scrutiny on costs even as lower cost streaming networks are encouraging more Americans every month to cut the cable cord.
It's been about two weeks since reports first surfaced that the DOJ was pushing back on this merger. So far, neither side is backing down. But only AT&T has the luxury of reversing course and still getting what it really wants. That's a luxury that may not last long as soon as the public gets a better idea of what this deal could cost them.
It's time for AT&T and Stephenson to grab that lifeline and stay silent all the way to the bank.

 Jim Cramer: It drives me 'crazy' DOJ is looking at AT&T deal in a static way   
 7:52  PM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 |  00:31 
 The government is myopic in its argument against the AT&T-Time Warner merger and doesn't comprehend the significant competitive threat from internet disruptors in the digital age.The Justice Department sued on Monday to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner, saying the deal will ""substantially lessen competition, resulting in higher prices and less innovation for millions of Americans.""
 AT&T announced an agreement to acquire Time Warner in October 2016 for a cash and stock deal valued at more than $85 billion.The crux of the government's case is AT&T will be able to leverage the power of Time Warner's content such as HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" and sports programming on TBS to raise pricing or gain subscribers at the expense of its competitors.But the DOJ's complaint fails to mention how AT&T is aggressively pricing its own innovative DirecTV Now internet TV streaming service, which cannibalizes its own satellite TV business. Consumers of the service have already received significant value ranging from free Apple TV boxes to cheaper HBO subscriptions.

DirectTV Now signage in the AT&T Vulture Lounge during the 2017 Vulture Festival at Highline Stages on May 21, 2017 in New York City.
 The internet television streaming service market is also currently booming. Consumers now have more choice and flexibility than ever before. Along with AT&T's DirecTV Now, there are well-funded other offerings such as Google's YouTube TV, Dish Network's Sling TV, Sony's PlayStation Vue and Hulu Live TV in the marketplace. 
 In addition, Disney announced plans in August to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018.
""You could not have a more vibrant competitive landscape than we have today and if anything this merger is going to cause people's cable bills or their TV bills to go down,"" AT&T outside counsel Dan Petrocelli told CNBC on Tuesday.
In fact, AT&T may be pursuing the deal from a position of weakness not strength. CEO Randall Stephenson described the competitive threat from the internet giants during the company's press conference Monday.
 ""Massive large-scale internet companies with market caps in the hundreds of billions of dollars are creating tons of original content and distributing it directly to the consumer. This is disrupting both industries, media and as well as the communications industry."" 
He cited how Netflix has more than 100 million subscribers and Amazon has an estimated 60 million Prime members. In addition, Stephenson noted Google and Facebook are now reaching billions of users.
In comparison the DOJ cited how AT&T has more than 25 million video subscribers across its television services in its lawsuit.
Even legendary cable industry deal-maker John Malone said his industry would not be able to catch up to Netflix due to the company's lead in size and large subscriber base.
The internet ""makes scale even more important in the media business, where scale always was important. It's all about scale,"" he said on Nov. 16. The billionaire investor noted the cable industry missed its opportunity to compete with Netflix in the past and said ""it's way too late"" now.
DOJ also seems to overstate the competitive moat for Time Warner's businesses.
Is ""Game of Thrones"" that different than what Netflix has been able to create with its original content offerings? No.
Does TBS have an irreplaceable advantage in its live sports offerings when Amazon, Facebook and Google are now bidding for the sports broadcasting rights with their massive balance sheets and distribution platforms? No.The government should look at the stock market's verdict on where the power resides and not risk interfering with the free-market's competitive dynamics.
AT&T stock has declined 19 percent year to date through Monday, while Time Warner shares have fallen 9 percent. The S&P 500 is up 15 percent in the same time period.
In contrast, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Netflix shares are up 50 percent, up 55 percent, up 31 percent and up 57 percent, respectively.

President Donald Trump speaks to the press before departing from the south lawn of the White House in Washington, DC on November 21, 2017.
 President Donald Trump weighed in briefly on the government's attempt to block the $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner merger. 
""Personally, I've always felt that that was a deal that's not good for the country. I think your pricing is going to go up,"" Trump said Tuesday to reporters outside the White House during an impromptu news conference.  ""But I'm not going to get involved, it's litigation.""
 The Justice Department filed a lawsuit Monday to block the deal, calling it ""illegal"" and saying it would raise prices for consumers and stifle innovation and competition. AT&T has vowed to fight the lawsuit in court, resisting suggestions it sell some of its divisions to win regulatory approval.
Last year on the campaign trail, Trump promised he would not let the just-announced AT&T-Time Warner deal go through, saying it would concentrate too much power in one company.

 AT&T counsel: We are going to defend this case and we expect to win it   
 9:51  AM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 |  10:25 
 ""There is no credible evidence"" that AT&T's proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of media powerhouse Time Warner poses any threat to industry competition or consumer prices, AT&T attorney Dan Petrocelli told CNBC on Tuesday.
 AT&T's lead outside counsel spoke one day after the Department of Justice sued to block the deal.
Regarding what he called a ""vibrant"" and ""competitive"" landscape for television and video distribution and content, Petrocelli argued: ""If anything, this merger is going to cause people's cable bills or TV bills to go down, not up."" 
 ""We want to go to court as soon as possible,"" he said on ""Squawk on the Street."" He said the ""good news"" was that the burden of proof is on the government. The last time the government won a case against this type of vertical merger —  one in which two companies don't directly compete in any business arena — Richard Nixon was president, he added.  ""Someone could call this fake antitrust.""
In a pre-emptive move last week, AT&T hired Petrocelli to serve as lead trial counsel in the case. Petrocelli, a partner at O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles, last year defended then-candidate Donald Trump against fraud lawsuits related to Trump University real estate seminars. He has also defended Time Warner and Disney in the past. His other clients have included Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling and the family of Ron Goldman in the wrongful death lawsuit against O.J. Simpson.
On Tuesday, Petrocelli pointed to a new live channel service from YouTube, a unit of Alphabet's Google, as ""a real bullet in the government's theory"" because it does not include content from the Turner networks, which are owned by Time Warner.""
""In today's world, consumers have so many options,"" he said. ""If they don't like someone's programming they can go over the top; they can go to all of these new services through the internet.""
AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson recently made a case that the content and distribution landscape has been shifting with the big tech companies becoming players in each. ""The idea that somehow we're going to take distribution and content and create something that's so powerful that we've disrupted Google, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, it borders on comical,"" he said at The New York Times' DealBook conference. ""What we're trying to do is build a platform that gives us an opportunity to compete with those guys.""
Petrocelli echoed Stephenson's sentiments. ""This allows Time Warner to hook up with the data that AT&T has, and to use all of that information to give consumers better product — one that is more innovative, one that's more customized.  And that's the world today,"" he told CNBC.
Earlier this month, reports circulated that the government had demanded AT&T sell its DirectTV unit or Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting, operator of the CNN, as a condition of approval. However, the government had pushed back at those reports, and AT&T said it had no intention of selling CNN.
While confident in his case, Petrocelli said that AT&T was open to settling its differences the government from ""Day 1.""
Asked on Tuesday whether the DOJ lawsuit was politically motivated, Petrocelli said: ""We don't know what was said by whom, to whom, when. In my experience things have a way of coming out in the course of litigation. So if there's anything there, it will probably unfold.""
The DOJ has said there was no contact with the White House on whether to bring this case.
The deal, announced in October 2016, was a hot topic on the presidential campaign trail. Trump, at the time, had said he would oppose the deal. But once he got into the White House, he remained mum.
There's been speculation that Trump's feud with CNN, a network he's repeatedly called ""fake news"" in tweets, may have been a factor in the DOJ's action But Stephenson has been a staunch supporter of Trump and of what many corporate leaders view as business-friendly policies from the president.
Complicating matters, Makan Delrahim, the DOJ's top antitrust official, said a year ago that the AT&T-Time Warner deal would be approved. He said his quotes from 2016 interview with a Canadian TV network were taken out of context.
But Petrocelli on Tuesday pressed the case. ""Nothing has changed in this deal from the time [Delrahim] made those remarks until today.""
AT&T said Monday the DOJ move was a radical departure from decades of antitrust regulation because the government does not usually fight what are known vertical mergers, deals between two companies that don't directly compete in any business arena.
A DOJ official countered, telling reporters the merger would raise prices for consumers and potentially block creators of media content from distributing their product without paying more money. The official said the AT&T deal would be more harmful to consumers than the 2011 Comcast-NBCUniversal deal, in part, because DirecTV satellite TV reach is nationwide. Comcast operates only in certain regions.
Stephenson said during a news conference on Monday that the government's argument ""defies logic."" He said a sale of CNN was a ""nonstarter,"" and he projected confidence that the company would not have to sell any assets.
""Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market,"" said AT&T general counsel David McAtee. ""We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently.""
— Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC's owner.
Correction: An earlier version incorrectly reported Petrocelli's role in the wrongful death lawsuit against O.J. Simpson. Petrocelli represented the family of slaying victim Ron Goldman.

 DOJ antitrust chief blocking AT&T-Time Warner deal didn't see a problem with it a year ago   
 12:32  PM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 |  01:16 
 When AT&T and Time Warner announced their $85 billion blockbuster merger in October 2016, politicians immediately said the deal would be scrutinized for its potential to raise prices for consumers.
 But then- Pepperdine University law professor Makan Delrahim, who had served in the Justice Department's antitrust division under President George W. Bush, offered a slightly more nuanced view in a Canadian television interview around the time the deal was announced.
The sheer size of the deal and the fact that it involved major media would certainly attract a lot of attention, he told Canada's BNN, but ""I don't see this as a major antitrust problem.""
 Delrahim, who also once lobbied on behalf of communications and technology companies, has since become antitrust chief in the Justice Department under President Donald Trump. On Monday, he sued to block the deal, calling it an ""illegal"" combination that harms consumers and stifles innovation.
Many legal minds — not least among them AT&T's legal team — have questioned the government's stance. It certainly would appear to be a major shift in thinking for Delrahim, at least as far as the views he shared during the Canadian television interview last year.
AT&T and Time Warner would be a ""vertical merger,"" one that combined AT&T's vast communications distribution network with Time Warner's marquee movie and television production assets, such as Warner Studios and the CNN news channel.
But this wasn't the type of vertical merger like Comcast's 2011 purchase of NBC Universal, he said, which combined a cable operator and a broadcaster, and it is not akin to a merger of direct competitors like DirectTV and Dish Network. 
""That's not to say that there aren't going to be some concerns and antitrust issues of you know, one distributor owning various content and it might somehow impact other distributors, but it doesn't raise the same challenges as some of those other transitions have brought,"" Delrahim said last year.
Dan Petrocelli, AT&T's outside counsel, told CNBC on Tuesday the last time the government won a case challenging a vertically integrated merger was during the Nixon administration. The government has the burden of proof, and it hasn't been able to win these cases. On Delrahim's comment last year, Petrocelli said: ""The reality is he was absolutely right. It doesn't pose any problem whatsoever.""
The DOJ didn't immediately return a call for comment.
Here is a transcript of the portion of the Canadian television interview in which he discusses the transaction:
INTERVIEW DATED: OCT. 24, 2016
QUESTIONS ARE PARAPHRASED, ANSWERS ARE VERBATIM
Delrahim: ""This certainly is an interesting deal. We've already heard over the weekend in Washington both the Republican and Democrat leaders of the Senate antitrust subcommittee issue a statement expecting a close examination of this transaction. You know, I've been reading a bit over the weekend and there has been some talk about the regulatory aspects. You know, this is more of what we would call a vertical merger, a content with distribution rather than two competitors merging. I anticipate that the FCC will have little if any role and it will be a pure antitrust … it shouldn't be – just the sheer size of it and the fact that it's media I think will get a lot of attention, however I don't see this as a major antitrust problem.""
Q: Given that Donald J. Trump has stated publicly that this is a deal that he would not allow to go through, and even though you don't think it will come up against any regulatory hurdles, can you maybe flesh out for us what potential regulatory hurdles there could be that could kill the deal?
Delrahim: ""Sure. It'll go through the typical merger review going through the antitrust division of the Justice Department. In the United States, one of the interesting parts of it is that there is a law, and the agency — if they find that it somehow is harmful to competition and that the exact legal standard is 'it substantially lessens competition' – then they will bring a lawsuit. They would have to go to court before an independent federal judge and prove their case, and the burden's with the Justice Department. Unlike other areas, or a deal that requires FCC review, this would be not so much up to an administration – an administration can oppose it — however a judge would also have to agree with them. There's very defined legal and econometric standards for these. For example, when I was at the Justice Department, the division brought a lawsuit against Oracle's acquisition of Peoplesoft. The DOJ thought that that was harmful to competition, they sued, went before a court, and a court disagreed with the DOJ, saying it didn't meet its burden, and the merger went through. There certainly is a lot of power within the administration, however, it's not the ultimate power.""
Question: Are comparisons between this deal and the Comcast-NBC Universal deal fair?
Delrahim: ""I have seen some of the comments and some of them are misplaced in that you have a broadcaster and a cable company coming together or you have two competitors like AT&T and T-Mobile trying to merge. Comcast-Universal with the NBC transition: The part that is different – certainly there are similarities in that you're buying a content producer and the various media assets that NBC Universal had – however, NBC was a broadcaster, which is a form of distribution, which was being bought by Comcast, which was a cable operator trying to buy media. Here, because Time Warner — and some of the confusion may be the fact that Time Warner doesn't own any cable operations anymore, they sold those off and so you're just dealing with pure content. That's not to say that there aren't going to be some concerns and antitrust issues of you know, one distributor owning various content and it might somehow impact other distributors, but it doesn't raise the same challenges as some of those other transitions have brought. Like DirectTV-Dish at one point attempted to merge and those two competitors would have raised a whole different set of issues than this would. From a technical standpoint, I think these folks would have an easier route toward approval than a merger of two competitors.""

 Analysts believe AT&T has a strong case in court against the Department of Justice over its deal to acquire Time Warner.
 The Justice Department sued on Monday to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner, calling it an ""illegal"" combination that harms consumers and stifles innovation, DOJ officials said.""After reviewing DOJ's lawsuit against AT&T-Time Warner and watching AT&T's press conference, we still see a settlement as possible and, failing that, we believe AT&T would prevail in court,"" Cowen's research team wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
""DOJ always bears the burden in court. But here we believe it will face a higher-than-normal burden because it needs to explain its departure from longstanding clearance of vertical transactions.""
 AT&T announced an agreement in October 2016 to acquire Time Warner in a cash and stock deal valued at more than $85 billion.AT&T's chief financial officer, John Stephens, said on Nov. 8 that the acquisition of Time Warner is a ""vertical integration"" merger across industries. He cited how the government has not blocked a ""vertical"" deal in more than 40 years.In similar fashion, Raymond James downplayed the DOJ's case against the AT&T-Time Warner merger.
""We believe the department's case appears weak as it ignores precedent and conveniently ignores the shifting digital nature of the industry. We also note that there have not been any state attorneys general that have sided with the department,"" analyst Frank Louthan wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""We do not believe AT&T will entertain any divestitures or wholesale/resale remedies. … We believe the case law and significant legal precedent for this deal heavily favor AT&T.""
The two companies' shares are underperforming the market so far this year. AT&T stock has declined 19 percent year to date through Monday, while Time Warner shares have fallen 9 percent. The S&P 500 is up 15 percent in the same time period.
Cowen reiterated its market perform rating on AT&T shares, while Raymond James reaffirmed its outperform rating for the company.

Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes (right), and AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson listen to testimony during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on Capitol Hill, December 7, 2016, in Washington, DC. The subcommittee heard testimony regarding a proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner.
 The Justice Department's lawsuit to block AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner seems more like a detour than a permanent shift in the federal government's antitrust strategy.
 The lawsuit, filed Monday in a D.C. federal court, had many lawyers and antitrust scholars wondering about the government's case. It hasn't successfully blocked a vertical deal like this in several decades, lawyers noted. And this time it appears to be partly politically motivated.
President Donald Trump has made no secret of his disdain for CNN, Time Warner's cable news channel that he has frequently called ""fake news."" And last year on the campaign trail he promised he would not approve the AT&T-Time Warner deal under his administration.
 Reports earlier this month said the Justice Department was seeking a sale of Turner Broadcasting, the parent of CNN, or Time Warner's DirectTV division to win approval of the merger.
AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said Monday the issue of CNN was the ""elephant in the room"" with regard to the DOJ lawsuit but he promised to fight the government in court. In the meantime, he said, the action ""throws a great deal of uncertainty on anyone contemplating M&A.""
Lawyers said Tuesday that regulators typically don't scrutinize vertical deals, which put different types of businesses that don't compete with each other under one roof. In this case, AT&T is the distribution network while Time Warner creates television shows and movies that get distributed on networks.
A vertical deal earlier this year between the e-commerce giant Amazon.com and the organic grocery chain Whole Foods Market closed relatively quickly after approval by the Federal Trade Commission. In contrast, the AT&T review has lasted longer than one year.
""Subjecting the AT&T-Time Warner merger to much more rigorous review (which has resulted in litigation) than the Amazon-Whole Foods deal makes little sense,"" said Michael Santorelli, director of New York Law School's Advanced Communications Law and Policy Institute. ""And it bolsters the perception that antitrust officials are out of touch with the realities of the modern market.""
The Whole Foods deal was approved before Makan Delrahim was confirmed as chief of the antitrust division at the DOJ, a position he only recently assumed. Delrahim is a former antitrust lawyer in the administration of George W. Bush and a former lobbyist. Last year, he said of the AT&T deal, ""I don't see this as a major antitrust problem.""
Most of the AT&T review was conducted by Justice Department staffers before Delrahim's arrival in office and it wasn't until he got there that he could examine the evidence, a government official told CNBC on Tuesday. In a letter to Sen. Elizabeth Warren earlier this month, about a month after Delrahim's Senate confirmation, a Justice Department assistant attorney general said that all investigations in the antitrust division are initiated and conducted in a ""fair, professional and impartial manner."" 
Until now, a pro-business administration had been viewed as favorable to the M&A scene, especially compared with an aggressive antitrust effort at the end of the Obama administration that resulted in the unwinding of several deals, including proposed tie-ups of Cigna-Anthem and Aetna-Humana, both shot down by a court earlier this year.
""A fair amount of mergers will go through,"" said George Hay, an antitrust expert who teaches at Cornell Law School. ""I don't think we're seeing a rejuvenated antitrust effort. This is a merger that would have been looked at seriously by any administration.""
Whether it puts a temporary chill on the deal market remains to be seen. Globally, $3.1 trillion worth of deals have been announced in 2017, with $1.2 trillion in the U.S., according to Dealogic. That is the lowest in dollar amount since 2013, though the number of deals has been relatively consistent.
Deals in the U.S. media sector in particular total $32 billion so far this year, the lowest in dollar terms since 2011.
There are 99 deals pending at the moment, according to Dealogic. Four of the 10 largest, including AT&T-Time Warner, were announced in 2016. Four other deals out of the top 10 have been announced since September, including Broadcom's massive $105 billion deal for Qualcomm.
And there are other deals that have been discussed but not formally announced, including a possible tie-up of pharmacy giant CVS Health with insurance giant Aetna and a sale of 21st Century Fox's movie and television production divisions to either Comcast or Disney. [Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.]
The Justice Department argues that the AT&T-Time Warner combination would kill competition, raise prices for consumers and stifle innovation. But it has a tough fight ahead, lawyers said, and it faces an opponent in AT&T with deep pockets to litigate the case.
Robert McDowell, a former commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission under the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, said on CNBC Tuesday that AT&T had the law on its side.
""It's a weak case,"" he said. ""Get the popcorn.""

 Lionsgate exec says the Disney-Fox deal is good news for them   
 5:48  PM ET Fri, 15 Dec 2017 |  04:44 
 Media mergers and acquisitions are a hot button topic. And while Lions Gate Chairman Michael Burns applauds the recent deal between Disney and Twenty-first Century Fox, he says not all media deals are created equal.
 Burns had nothing but good things to say about Disney's more than $52 billion deal with Fox,  arguing the mega-merger serves Lions Gate, a production and distribution company known for such films as the ""Hunger Games"" series.
""I think the deal is good for us, it certainly validates content,"" Burns said on CNBC's ""Fast Money."" 
 Lions Gate, which  not only produces films, but has 45 shows on 90 different platforms is diverse enough to survive, Burns said. And it helps that the big deal will strengthen smaller players, like Hulu, which can then purchase more content from Lions Gate.
""Lions Gate thrives in chaos,"" he added.
It also helps Lions Gate, Burns said, by reducing competitors in the market.
""I would guess they'll stick to big franchises, the movies they can promote in theme parks,"" he said. ""I  think the movies will have fewer big, wide releases than the two as separate companies.""
When it comes to Time Warner and AT&T, the two companies whose talks have been called ""illegal"" by the Justice Department, Burns isn't quite so confident. He said he worries the deal would give the conglomerate a monopoly, and create incentive to hurt smaller companies. 
""What's most important to us is to make sure that we, if approved, are treated fairly. If we're not going to be treated fairly, then of course we would be against it,"" Burns said.
And Lions Gate isn't just sitting idly by. Burns said the company has been approached by regulators to give their opinions on the matter. 
""We are more than an interested party,"" he added.

 AT&T posted fourth-quarter results that bested Wall Street expectations on Wednesday.
 The company said it saw strong wireless customer growth as well as fewer subscriber cancellations than the Street had projected. AT&T also gave strong guidance for fiscal 2018.
The stock rose more than 3 percent in after-hours trade as more than 5 million shares changed hands.
 Here's how the company did compared with what analysts expected:
 EPS: 78 cents vs. 65 cents expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $41.68 billion vs. $41.19 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters U.S. wireless net adds: 2.7 million vs. 2.2 million expected according to StreetAccount Mexico wireless net adds: 1.3 million vs. 1.1 million expected according to StreetAccount Postpaid churn rate: 0.89% vs. 1.15% expected according to StreetAccount 
AT&T said it added a total of 4.1 million wireless customers in the fourth quarter. The company said 2.7 million of those new customers were in the United States, more than the 2.2 million the Street had expected.
The company also said it saw its lowest-ever fourth-quarter subscriber cancellation rate. The postpaid churn rate was 0.89 percent for the quarter. The total was lower, therefore better, than Wall Street's expectation of 1.15 percent, according to StreetAccount.
For 2018, AT&T said it expects adjusted earnings of about $3.50 per share. Analysts had previously forecast that the company would report full-year earnings of $3.05 per share.
Randall Stephenson, chairman and CEO of AT&T, said in a statement he expects tax reform and ""regulatory rationalization"" to have a positive impact on both the economy and the company.
The company said it expects its 2018 effective tax rate to be about 23 percent. AT&T said that rate will likely lead to an additional $3 billion in cash. For the year,  the company said it expects free cash flow of about $21 billion.
In December, AT&T said it will give $1,000 bonuses to more than 200,000 U.S. employees, citing the passage of tax reform. The company also said it plans to spend an additional $1 billion in the United States after the recent tax overhaul.
The new tax law slashes the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from the previous rate of 35 percent.  AT&T said in its 2016 annual report that its effective tax rate was 32.7 percent.
The company could also stand to benefit from the FCC's recent repeal of net neutrality regulation. This new landscape allows AT&T more flexibility to control the pricing and speed of content for its internet customer. AT&T has said, however, it will not make big changes to the way internet services are delivered.
In a Wednesday earnings call, Stephenson said this ruling is a step in the right direction. He said, however, that Congress needs to create legislation that governs internet companies and protects consumers. Stephenson said that the industry needs the ""long-term predictability"" and clarity on issues like customer privacy and internet regulation.
But the mobile giant faces political headwinds amid increased scrutiny of mega-mergers. Late last year, the Justice Department challenged AT&T's pending merger with Time Warner. President Donald Trump has said the deal is  ""not good for the country"" because it might lead to higher prices for consumers.
But Stephenson said in Wednesday's release that the company looks forward to presenting its case in court and finalizing the Time Warner deal.
Stephenson said during the earnings call that closing the acquisition is AT&T's top priority for 2018. He said the AT&T was surprised that the government moved to block the deal, calling the proposed acquisition a ""classic vertical merger between two companies that don't even compete with one another.""
""With 50 years of legal precedent, it's the type of business combination that the government has consistently approved with appropriate conditions,"" he said.
AT&T is slated to make its case for the merger on March 19.

President Donald Trump listens to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson during the 'American Leadership in Emerging Technology' event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on Thursday, June 22, 2017.
 President Donald Trump doesn't have a lot of friends in Silicon Valley. However, as his administration delays approving the AT&T-Time Warner merger, he is unintentionally making life much easier for the biggest technology companies. 
 The Justice Department's decision to sue to block the $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T has clogged up the future of the legacy media business as executives wait to see what's possible — and what isn't — in a Trump administration. Meanwhile, tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet's YouTube, and Facebook are free to spend billions on original content, buoyed by the rising growth that traditional media companies lack.
""For the first time, I don't understand what's possible regulatorily when it comes to horizontal integration or to vertical integration, and even whether or not behavioral remedies will be meaningful again,"" said Leo Hindery, managing partner of InterMedia Partners and the former CEO of both TCI and AT&T Broadband, once the largest U.S. cable company. ""There are now inconsistent strategies from company to company and people are stepping every day into each other's sandboxes.""
 The threat of tech giants moving in on traditional media businesses is one of the reasons Rupert Murdoch decided to sell $52.4 billion worth of 21st Century Fox assets to Disney in December, according to people familiar with the matter. That sale included Fox's movie studio, some cable channels and stakes in Sky, Endemol Shine Group and Hulu, as well as regional sports networks.

 Outlook for mergers and acquisitions market is robust going into 2018: Deutsche Bank   
 4:18  AM ET Fri, 15 Dec 2017 |  02:43 
 Murdoch is concerned the largest technology companies will outspend Fox and other TV-first programmers on new content and sports rights in the coming years, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Media companies are trying to respond by getting bigger and bulking up their balance sheets to compete.
Fox shelled out $3 billion for Thursday Night NFL rights for the next five years in a deal announced last week. The price to broadcast football games keeps rising even as NFL ratings have declined for the second consecutive season. That's because traditional TV programmers like Fox need must-see live content to differentiate from on-demand services such as Netflix, which is spending up to $8 billion on content next year alone.   
Access to sports and live events is also important to keep the cable-TV ecosystem relevant -- high-demand content drives cable's bundling strategy, where it sells large groups of channels together. Total U.S. households paying for cable or satellite TV could fall to 92 million in 2018, according to a UBS estimate, down 11 percent from 2012, when pay-TV households peaked at 103 million. 
The combined market valuations of the big legacy media companies like Comcast, Disney, Fox and Time Warner is about $500 billion. That collective number trails the individual market caps of Apple, Amazon and Facebook.
Apple's market valuation, by itself, is around $830 billion. Amazon's is approaching $700 billion. Facebook is around $550 billion. Netflix's market cap, which is around $115 billion, tops both Fox and Time Warner.
 A brake on other deals
 Blocking AT&T-Time Warner has put the brakes on a series of domino deals that would drastically consolidate the media landscape. 
If AT&T-Time Warner isn't allowed to proceed, Time Warner, which owns HBO, CNN, Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. studio, will almost certainly look for a new merger partner. AT&T will also be forced to alter its strategy of vertical integration.
It's conceivable Disney may not be allowed to buy Fox either, though Trump did publicly congratulate Murdoch on the deal when it was announced, suggesting his approval. 
If AT&T-Time Warner is able to move forward, Verizon immediately becomes another potential buyer of big media. 
Comcast, CNBC's owner, could also consider topping Disney's bid for Fox, according to people familiar with the matter. No decision has been made by Comcast on a topping bid yet, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision is private. Disney is already preparing itself for a Comcast topping bid and considering responses in case, according to multiple people familiar with Disney's thinking. 
An unsolicited offer at a premium to Disney's bid could persuade enough Fox shareholders to vote against Murdoch. His family controls 39 percent of Fox's Class B voting shares but owns only 17 percent of all outstanding shares. Comcast executives suggested to Murdoch last year they would be willing to pay significantly more for Fox's assets than what Disney was offering, said the people. Murdoch still went with the Disney offer, in large part due to regulatory concerns with Comcast. 
Fox's international businesses are of particular interest to Comcast, which sees more potential growth outside of the U.S. than it does domestically. Spokeswomen for Comcast and Fox declined to comment.
""Many of our peers are re-evaluating their strategies,"" Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said during the company's Jan. 24 earnings call. ""So along the way, there may be opportunities for us to create more value for our shareholders, like we did with NBCUniversal. In this respect, it shouldn't be a surprise that we study every situation that comes along.""
Even if the U.S. district court upholds the Justice Department's decision to block the deal, Time Warner could sue again, bringing the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. That decision could be more than a year away, causing the media landscape to remain frozen for years.
""For the longest time, we had decades of very successful vertical integration, with common finish lines for the whole of the media and telecommunications industries,"" Hindery said. ""Not anymore.""
 Family planning
 Beyond the fear of Silicon Valley's impending takeover of live and original content, companies including Fox, CBS and Viacom are also looking for regulatory clarity so their majority owners can clear up estate planning issues. 
Murdoch's decision to shed Fox assets puts his son Lachlan in place to run the smaller Fox, according to a person familiar with Murdoch's thinking. It also allows his other son, James, the freedom to move away from the business if he chooses, the person said.

 Shari Redstone also isn't waiting for Time Warner, even though CBS and Time Warner could be natural merger candidates.
Sumner Redstone's daughter took control of her 94-year-old father's media empire, National Amusements, last year as his health declined. National Amusements owns about 80 percent of the common stock of CBS and Viacom. Redstone is now considering putting the companies back together after a false start last year.
John Malone has successfully orchestrated two programming mergers in just over a year, putting together Lionsgate and Starz in December 2016 and championing Discovery's decision to acquire Scripps last year. Malone controls about 28 percent of Discovery's voting shares. Lionsgate, now combined with Starz, may look for a larger buyer later this year, although it isn't yet in formal sales talks, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
The sudden push for massive media consolidation is largely driven by the realization that the media ecosystem is shifting from television to the Internet, even if the cable subscription model allows legacy media companies to profitably survive. Still, after decades of pushing for higher affiliate fees from TV operators, such as Comcast, Charter and Dish Network, TV programmers are now banding together to ensure their most popular channels survive and drive growth.
""In the opening scene of 'March of the Penguins,' the penguins are huddling up to get warm in a pack so large so that they can withstand the harshness of winter and survive a little bit longer,"" said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG who covers the media industry. ""This is what's happening to legacy media companies. They are banding together, trying to stay alive to survive another winter.""
Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

 AT&T CEO: We feel good about the Time Warner case   
 9:13  AM ET Fri,  9 Feb 2018 |  02:48 
 AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson said Friday it makes no sense for the government to oppose the telecommunications giant's $85 billion buyout of Time Warner on the grounds that content distributors and content creators under the same umbrella would be anti-competitive.
 He said major technology firms such as Netflix and Amazon are allowed to do the same thing.
""Reality is, the biggest distributor of content out there is totally vertically integrated. This happens to be something called Netflix. But they create original content; they aggregate original content; and they distribute original content. They have 100 million subscribers,"" Stephenson said on CNBC. ""Look at Amazon. They're doing the exact same thing. Amazon Studios, creating, aggregating, distributing; Google, YouTube, Hulu, this thing is prolific."" 
 AT&T has long-maintained that buying Time Warner is what's called a vertical merger, meaning AT&T's mobile network, satellite TV service DirecTV and high-speed internet solutions don't directly compete with any of Time Warner's businesses. 
AT&T is preparing to face off in court next month against the Justice Department, which in November filed a lawsuit to block the deal. The DOJ has argued the merger combining Time Warner's content-generating properties including HBO, CNN, Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. studio would give AT&T the ability and incentive to raise prices that it charges cable television, satellite and streaming video rivals for Time Warner content.
 The company is in litigation with hearings and depositions going on, said Stephenson, who appeared on ""Squawk Box"" in an interview from Pebble Beach, California, site of the AT&T Pro-Am golf tournament. He said the judge set to preside over the March 19 trial has committed to a quick proceeding.
Stephenson has been a supporter of Donald Trump during the campaign and as president. However, then-candidate Trump attacked the deal, which was announced in October 2016.
One day after last year's DOJ suit, Trump reiterated his feeling that the deal would not be good for the country because it might lead to higher prices for consumers. Trump has certainly made no secret of his disdain for Time Warner's CNN, which he has repeatedly called ""fake news.""
On Thursday, four House Democrats wrote the Justice Department to request documents related to the agency's suit to block the merger. ""We are deeply concerned by reports of inappropriate interference by the White House,"" said the letter signed by Reps. Jerrold Nadler, Elijah Cummings, David Cicilline and Gerald Connolly.
On AT&T's earnings conference call last month, Stephenson said, ""With 50 years of legal precedent, it's the type of business combination that the government has consistently approved with appropriate conditions."" He added that closing the Time Warner deal remains a top priority.
