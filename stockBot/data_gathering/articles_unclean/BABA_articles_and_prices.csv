JACK MA ON GLOBALIZATION AND INTERACTION WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP
JACK MA: My belief is that globalization is good. But it needs to be improved. Globalization should be inclusive to everybody. We should not, you know, throw out the baby, because the baby is crying too much. It's a good thing. But how can you improve it? Globalization only in the past 30 years. So what if we can improve next 30 years? I'm a believer, strong believer, that globalization can help create jobs, especially small businesses. Next 30 years, the technology is going to challenge a lot of job opportunities. So if we cannot help the local business going global, it's going to be a big problem. Today, I see so many small businesses. They're buying from this country, manufacturing there, design in the U.S.A., and sell to China. This is called global business.
DAVID FABER: Right. Supply chains are all over the place.
JACK MA: That's right.
DAVID FABER: There is absolutely. Globalization, many would argue, has been a benefit for the world economy, as you just said. However, you seem to be swimming against the current tide. I know you're talking about a replacement or a different organization than the World Trade Organization that you're sort of thinking about, that would empower small business. But when you have governments that are not embracing it the way they once did, isn't that a threat?
JACK MA: No. In the past 18 years, when I do internet in China, we got criticism every day. You know, something where you believe it, a lot of people criticize it. But if you really believe it, continue to do it, improve it. I've been doing like a crazy man. Last year, I fly in the air 870 hours. And this year, I will fly, maybe, over 1,000 hours in the air.
DAVID FABER: Why are you doing that? Why are you spending 1,000 hours in an airplane and visiting with world leaders? What's the point?
JACK MA: You have to push it. Convincing people globalization is good, convincing people free trade is good, convincing them that small business should be the driver of the globalization, the force. You cannot stop globalization. The world is getting so small, right? Internet, airplane tickets, and the people traveling around the world. How can you stop it?
DAVID FABER: You can't.
JACK MA: You cannot stop it. If you cannot stop it, improve it.
DAVID FABER: All right. So you go, and you talk to various world leaders, including the President of the United States earlier this year. Did he embrace what you're talking about? Because certainly, his platform has not been one that has necessarily embraced the ideas you're espousing.
JACK MA: I think he supported the small business and young people. And when I say, we are going to have a small business summit in the Midwest, in Detroit, he was so excited. He said, ""Jack, this is a great idea. Please do it. And if there's anything I can help, let me know.""
JACK MA ON JOBS AND CHINA DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION
JACK MA: We created more than 33 million jobs for China. And we believe that, even one online shop can create at least 1 million jobs.
DAVID FABER: It's an enormous number. It would be, obviously, a great benefit. But still, how would that work?
JACK MA: We already did a lot of things for Americans creating jobs in the past 18 years, when we do the B to B. Even in California, there are more than 20,000 small businesses using Alibaba platform to sell their products across the board, to buy products from outside, and assembling them and packaging them and sell them. Already create a lot of jobs. We proved the model. We proved this model in the other countries, too.
DAVID FABER: Apples grown in Washington State can end up in China.
JACK MA: Yeah, yeah, cherries. Yeah.
DAVID FABER: Or cherries. But it's got to be more than just apples and cherries, doesn't it?
JACK MA: June 18th, we had a small promotion. Within 15 minutes, or less than 15 minutes, we sold 2 million lipsticks. China's girl – women love this kind of stuff. So we think that this is the demand. By the way, I say, past 30 years, the domestic consumption of the United States drives the global economy and drives – supporting so many small businesses in America or China to sell things globally. Today, next 30 years, the domestic demanding power of China is going to drive millions and millions of small businesses globally.
DAVID FABER: And it has turned. But that economy that we've been waiting for is still in process. I mean, the Chinese economy is still an export-driven economy, not a consumption-driven economy, no?
JACK MA: China's changing. China is going to import $8 trillion in the next five years. China knows very well, China has to buy. Because as I said, 300 million middle class. They need high-quality products, high-quality services.
JACK MA ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, DATA AND JOBS
JACK MA: The first technology revolution caused World War I. The second technology revolution caused World War number-- war two. This is the third technology revolution. People are already unhappy. Because a lot of machine learning, artificial intelligence, killing a lot of jobs. So this is what I think. The way to figure out the job creation, one of the best ways, is to help small business to sell their local products across the board. And we have to prepare now. Because next 30 years, is going to be painful.
DAVID FABER: It's going to be painful.
JACK MA: Very painful.
DAVID FABER: Because of the changes that are going to take place.
JACK MA: Change of the technology, change of the –
DAVID FABER: You're going to have a lot of people with a lot of time on their hands, too –
JACK MA: Well, you know, the other thing people are—
DAVID FABER: How they might want to spend it on Alibaba watching movies and buying things. But –
JACK MA: Well, believe or not, I think next 30 years, people only work four hours a day and maybe four days a week. My grandfather worked 16 hours a day in the farmland to digging. He thinks he's very busy. We work eight hours, five days a week. We think we are very busy. By the next 30 years, people only work four hours. Normal people visit, like, 30 places. 30 years later, they will probably visit 300 places. So they will be a mobile population. So stop globalization. It is impossible. The only thing is that, how can we make the globalization more inclusive, the trade more inclusive, knowledge more inclusive? This is how we can deal with the instability of the world.
DAVID FABER: These are all very important issues. But a lot of them do come back to politics. They come back to governments and the willingness to invest and the willingness to make hard choices. I'm not seeing a lot of those hard choices being made right now in the world.
JACK MA: This is why I'm traveling, talking to all the government and state leaders and telling them, moving fast. If they do not move fast, there's going to be trouble. My belief is that you have to repair the roof while it is still sunshine.
DAVID FABER: Do you think the machines will win?
JACK MA: No. Humans will win.
DAVID FABER: They will?
JACK MA: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Machine is good for knowledge. But human being are good at the wisdom. So that is why I'm encouraging a lot of governments and talking to a lot of government officials. Pay special attention to the education system. If you want the machine is going to be smarter than human beings. This is for sure. Because the day where we design the machine, we know machine is powerful, stronger than us. When we designed the trains and buses, we know machines are going to run faster than us. When we have the computers, we have to know that machine is going to be smarter than us. But the human beings, they are not only smart. They have the wisdom.
DAVID FABER: And so artificial intelligence will never have wisdom?
JACK MA: No. Artificial intelligence is going to be very smart. So the smart – between smart and the wisdom, smart people know what you want. Wisdom people, wise people, know what they don't want.
DAVID FABER: I just continue to wonder what that world will look like over the next 30 years and whether we can survive –
JACK MA: It's going to be painful.
DAVID FABER: What's painful? What does that mean?
JACK MA: Well, you will see that some people, because the knowledge is not enough. The wisdom is not enough. So the new wave coming, the job is being taken away. Some people who catch up the wave will be rich, will be more successful. Some people will be more painful. The government, you know, the world is going to be data. The people will now have more data than the bosses.
DAVID FABER: You have a lot of data at Alibaba, don't you?
JACK MA: Yeah, we do.
DAVID FABER: And how are you focused on creating and obtaining more of it?
JACK MA: I think it's just the beginning of the data period. We think data is going to be so important to human life in the future. Compared to tomorrow, our data is nothing. Tomorrow, IOT, internet of things, everything connected. Everything will be—
DAVID FABER: Billions upon billions of devices connected.
JACK MA: We think that we are a big data company today. That was compared to yesterday. Compared to tomorrow, we are nothing.
DAVID FABER: Well, what will it let you do, having access to that data, as it accumulates more and more? What will it allow you to do?
JACK MA: Improve people's lives, improve the machines, to make sure the machine can do a better job to support human beings instead of machine do better job than human jobs. So I think that they – we don't know how data really can make money today. But we know we have to protect the security of the data, the privacy of the data. And when we know, one day, that data will empower the human being.
DAVID FABER: But you know a lot about your customers already, I would assume. I mean, they've spent a lot of time on the platform, what, 25 minutes a day, seven times a day. Many of them are younger. They're using their mobile devices. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.
JACK MA: Yeah, that's the beginning. Just today's data is like 100 years ago, people thinking about electricity is the lights, you know? But they never thought, 100 years later, we have a refrigerator and a washing machine. Everything is using electricity. So data. You know, we have to believe our kids will be much smarter than us using the data.
DAVID FABER: But you don't believe all that data, when used with artificial intelligence, will create wisdom. You don't.
JACK MA: No. No. No. Wisdom is from the heart. The machine intelligence is by the brain. Brain is about knowledge. You can always make a machine to learn the knowledge. But it is difficult for machines to have a human heart.
JACK MA ON ANBANG
JACK MA: Well, I think, as businesspeople, me, I do everything to make sure that my customers happy, employees happy, the society is good. It's healthy. Social responsibility is the key. Whatever we do, we try to make sure that the society is good. So I don't know what's going on with the others.
DAVID FABER: You don't.
JACK MA: I don't. But—
DAVID FABER: I mean, it's a small community of you giants in Chinese business. You don't know have any idea what happened to Chairman Wu?
JACK MA: I know these guys. I know Chairman Wu for years. But we do never talk about the what we think about. So sometimes, when I look at these businesspeople doing things, I say, ""Wow. I'm not going to do anything like that.""
DAVID FABER: And it doesn't concern you, when you see them without any idea of why they've been – disappeared?
JACK MA: I talked to some of them. Well, I talked to some of the people. I say, ""Hey, guys. If I were you, I would focus on customers. I would focus on not making money. I would focus on making value."" A lot of people so keen about making money. When they're keen about making money – so, I believe there are three things you should not touch: power, money, and the glory.
JACK MA ON FINTECH
JACK MA: Yeah, someday. It will be as known as Alibaba, probably be, I don't know, much more famous than Alibaba.
DAVID FABER: More famous? Why?
JACK MA: Yeah. Because I think the techfin that we are doing, we are enabling small businesses and young people to be able to reach financial support. The fintech is to empower the financial institute to be more powerful. Maybe they want to support their customers better. But we think that we should make the Ali into financing is something we want to do that how we can build up a system that can meet the needs of 21st century financial needs. And the second thing is how we can make financial really inclusive. So now, we are growing so fast in China. We are growing so fast in India, a lot of developing countries have been using that. Someday, there will be IPO. Not because we want to raise money, because we want let more people share and more people know about it, more people benefit.
DAVID FABER: That's what you said about Alibaba, too, when you took it public.
JACK MA: Well, yeah. So in today, China, we are making a lot of cities cashless society.
DAVID FABER: You believe China will be a cashless society?
JACK MA: Of course, yeah. We will keep on doing. Next five years, we already come to – in five years, we will make most of the cities cashless societies in China. Hangzhou, my city, is already cashless society, almost.
DAVID FABER: Although there's a lot of competition. I mean, WeChat, Tencent's WeChat Mobile is taking market share from Alipay, isn't it?
JACK MA: Well, when you do business, don't worry about competition. There's nowhere in this world there's no competition. You have to get used to it. So it's not about – this techfin is just the beginning.

But for those who fall behind, says Ma, the future will be ""painful.""
 At the heart of the fast-approaching technological new age, Ma says, is data. According to his projections for the future job market, skills associated with data and its analysis will become extremely valuable.

Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba group, delivers a speech during 2017 Global Smart Logistics Summit at Hangzhou Cloud Town on May 22, 2017 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province of China.
 Alibaba shares, already among the market's best performers, will surge as new marketing data services boost the e-commerce giant's financial results, according to JPMorgan.Analyst Alex Yao resumed coverage on Alibaba with an overweight rating and a 12-month price target of $190, representing 33 percent upside from Monday's close.  ""We believe Alibaba's core commerce is expanding from traffic monetization to data monetization and this trend will quickly expand to its media/cloud businesses,"" Yao wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""Such expansion not only allows Alibaba to tap into non-transaction-based corporate budget (e.g. market research, brand awareness, customer service), but also supports our investment thesis based on sustainable revenue/earnings growth.""
 Alibaba shares have rallied 62.5 percent this year through Monday, compared with the S&P 500's 8.9 percent return in that period. JPMorgan and Raymond James have the highest price targets among research firms following the stock, according to FactSet. The next highest target is $177 from MKM Partners. Yao said Alibaba has the ability to sell valuable data it collects on consumer buying decisions. He cited the company's profiles on more than 500 million customers that use various Alibaba services. The firm also recently launched its new ""Uni Marketing"" data solution, which measures the effectiveness of corporate ad campaigns. ""Financial returns from monetization of such data technology have yet to be factored into our estimates. We believe data monetization through ad products is a high-margin business by nature,"" he wrote.

3,2017-06-28,'They've lost interest': Alibaba exec claims Chinese counterfeit market is sputtering  ,"Everett Rosenfeld | CNBC 
Gao Hongbing, an Alibaba Group vice president and director of AliResearch, discusses the Chinese consumer at the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China.
 DALIAN, China — The Chinese market for counterfeits is petering out as consumers grow more choosy about quality and brand-names, a top Alibaba executive said Wednesday.
 Gao Hongbing, an Alibaba Group vice president and director of research arm AliResearch, offered some predictions on the fate of counterfeits in response to a question from CNBC at the World Economic Forum's ""Summer Davos"" meeting in Dalian, China. Knock-offs have long been a staple of China's consumer economy, and Alibaba has been repeatedly called out for what critics characterized as lax enforcement against such items.
Emphasizing efforts to combat counterfeits' proliferation, Gao acknowledged that ""there are some fake and counterfeit products sold online — there's no way to avoid that.""
 Still, he said, today's consumers in China have become increasingly ""aware"" of quality consumption — meaning that they are preferring to spend their money on genuine articles.
""I think they've lost interest,"" Gao said of the mainstream Chinese consumer's attraction to knock-offs. ""Therefore they like more high-quality and genuine products.""
The Alibaba executive added that young consumers are even more attuned to products' quality and branding. Therefore, he predicted, China's ""quality consumption"" will eventually be elevated to the top spot globally.

Alibaba Group Chairman Jack Ma
 Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is working on a Chinese-language device to rival Amazon's Echo, according to a report published Thursday by The Information.
The device could come as early as next week, people familiar with the matter told The Information. The device could potentially understand Chinese voice commands and, like the Echo, allow Alibaba's core users to buy products from shopping sites, The Information said. 
 Though Alibaba is often dubbed ""The Amazon of China,"" Alibaba founder Jack Ma has said that Amazon is closer to a retailer while Alibaba is more like a small business ecosystem. Still, the two companies compete in similar areas outside of shopping, including movies, cloud, groceries and artificial intelligence.

 });Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is ponying up $1 billion to boost its stake in Southeast Asian online retailer Lazada, ahead of Amazon's much-anticipated entry into the region. 
 On Wednesday, Alibaba said it will increase its stake in the company from 51 percent to about 83 percent, bringing its total investment to over $2 billion. 
 Krisztian Bocsi | Bloomberg | Getty Images
 The investment underscores increased confidence in Southeast Asia's growing e-commerce market, as millions of  first-generation internet users embrace online shopping.
 A commonly cited study conducted in 2016 by Google and the Singapore government's investment arm, Temasek Holdings, predicted the region's internet economy was expected to grow to $200 billion by 2025, primarily driven by growth in e-commerce.
""The e-commerce markets in the region are still relatively untapped, and we see a very positive upward trajectory ahead of us. We will continue to put our resources to work in Southeast Asia through Lazada to capture these growth opportunities,"" said Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba Group, in a prepared statement. 
Lazada did not say if the new investment from Alibaba was a pre-emptive measure to tackle Amazon's eventual entry into the southeast Asian market. Instead, in an emailed response, Lazada CEO Maximilian Bittner said, ""This investment is first and foremost an affirmation of Lazada's continued success, and of Alibaba's confidence in Lazada. It is also a commitment to the region.""
Bittner added, ""With Southeast Asia's e-commerce markets still being relatively untapped, we see a very positive upward trajectory ahead of us and Alibaba will continue to put its resources to work in Southeast Asia through Lazada to capture these growth opportunities.""
Alibaba said it will purchase shares of certain Lazada shareholders at an implied valuation of $3.15 billion. Last year, the tech giant bought partial stakes from Germany's Rocket Internet and British supermarket giant Tesco. 
The Alibaba-Lazada deals expand the Chinese e-commerce player's global footprint in markets including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. In a recent report, Alibaba said in the 12 months through the end of March, Lazada had approximately 23 million active buyers. 
Lazada has also invested further in the region by acquiring online grocer RedMart. It also launched a partnership with Unilever, aiming to tap a bigger slice of the region's online retail market. 
Additionally, it teamed up with brands to create a subscription-based membership program, LiveUp, for customers in Singapore. The service offers rewards and promotions from brands including Netflix, Uber, UberEATS, RedMart and Taobao Collection.
The Southeast Asian retailer said the partnership with Alibaba would allow Lazada to invest further in the marketplace, technology, payments and logistics to better support shoppers and merchants, many of which are small businesses. 
Last year, TechCrunch reported that Amazon had planned to launch local e-commerce services in Singapore in the first quarter of 2017. But earlier this year, the news site cited sources and said Amazon's much-anticipated entry was postponed. 
Alibaba and Amazon didn't immediately respond to CNBC's emailed requests for comment.

 But, he adds, for those who can adapt to the demands of the changing labor market by learning new skills, life won't be that bad. In a recent interview with CNBC, Ma outlines two ways he thinks automation will improve the lives of those who can keep their jobs.

Jack Ma, Chairman of Alibaba Group at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 1) Less time spent working 
 ""Believe it or not, I think in the next 30 years, people will only work four hours a day,"" Ma tells CNBC's David Faber, ""and maybe four days a week.""
That's a 16-hour work week. The billionaire sees it as the natural result of technology picking up more tasks humans once had to do. He notes that while his grandfather worked 16-hour days ""in the farmland digging,"" he himself works eight-hour days and future workers will work only four-hour days.

 Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has made a similar point, arguing that automation will allow people more time for ""interesting things"" and leisure activities. 
2) More time for travel 
Because automation will reduce the number of hours humans have to work, people will be able to travel more. Ma says that today people visit an average of 30 places in their lifetime but in the future, that number may be as high as 300.
""I think the good thing,"" Ma says, ""is that technology is going to improve people's lives.""

 Alibaba unveils smart speaker to rival Amazon Echo and Google Home   
 11:45  AM ET Wed,  5 July 2017 |  01:52 
 Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has jumped into the smart home speaker space.
 The company on Wednesday launched a device called the Tianmao JinglingX1 (Tmall Genie X1). It's Alibaba's version of Amazon's popular Echo device. The X1 is available only in China and speaks only Mandarin.
It was only a matter of time, as voice-activated personal assistants have taken off over the last year. Amazon introduced its Echo in November 2014, but over the last six months, Alphabet, Microsoft and Apple have jumped in with their own versions. EMarketer expects that nearly 36 million Americans will use a smart speaker at least once a month this year — a jump of almost 130 percent over last year.
 The biggest tech names in China have already been getting in on the action, too. Search giant Baidu has the Xiaoyu Zaijia and Alibaba's rival JD.com has the LingLong DingDong.
So while Alibaba may not be first to the Chinese market, the company believes that its artificial intelligence, troves of data and huge e-commerce platform will make it a leader. At a press conference in Beijing, an Alibaba executive said the X1 already has ""hundreds of skills"" in music, entertainment, online shopping, fitness and education.
The Tmall Genie X1 will cost the equivalent of $73 for the first 1,000 people purchasing one during a one month trial when it goes on sale Aug. 8.

6,2017-07-06,Alibaba among investors as Chinese bike sharing startup Ofo raises $700 million in fresh funds  ,"Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Ofo bicycles sit parked on a sidewalk in Shanghai, China.
 Chinese bike-sharing startup Ofo has set its sights on global expansion, saying on Thursday it raised over $700 million in a funding round that included Jack Ma's Alibaba Group.
 The funding round was led by Alibaba, Hony Capital and CITIC Private Equity, with additional participation from existing investors Didi Chuxing and DST Global. 
""We will further upgrade our service for better user experiences, accelerate our global expansion strategy and continue to lead the bike-sharing industry,"" said Dai Wei, founder and CEO of Ofo, in a prepared statement. ""Our vision is to unlock every corner of the world, and make Ofo the universal language."" 
 Ofo declined to disclose the valuation for the current funding round, but Dai told CNBC in April the company was worth more than $2 billion. 
China's bike-sharing industry has been heating up, with upstarts such as Ofo, rival Beijing Mobike Technology and others aiming to improve urban mobility in the country and promote greener transport. 
The concept of bike-sharing is simple enough: People use a smartphone app to unlock a nearby bike and ride to their final destination for a small fee, beating the clogged traffic in many Chinese cities. 
Investors have seen the potential for the market, and have poured sizable chunks of money into the segment. Before Thursday's funding news, Ofo said it had raised more than $650 million.
Last month, Mobike said it had raised over $600 million in a funding round led by internet giant Tencent Holdings and joined by Sequoia, TPG and Hillhouse Capital among others. 
By the end of the year, Ofo said it planned to deploy 20 million bikes to the bike-sharing ecosystem and to expand its services to reach 200 cities in 20 countries around the world. The company added that it currently has over 6.5 million bikes in 150 cities.

7,2017-07-12,Alibaba-backed Lazada says it's 'confident' it can take the competition  ,"E-commerce player Lazada, which is now majority-owned by Alibaba, is confident that its expertise in Southeast Asian markets can counter the looming threat from Amazon's much-anticipated entry into the region, a top executive told CNBC.
 Last year, TechCrunch reported that Amazon had planned to launch local e-commerce services in Singapore in the first quarter of 2017. But earlier this year, the news site cited sources and said Amazon's much-anticipated entry was postponed.
 Anthony Kwan | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Aimone Ripa di Meana, co-founder and chief marketplace officer of Lazada Group, speaks at the Rise conference in Hong Kong, China, on July 12, 2017.
 Aimone Ripa di Meana, co-founder and chief marketplace officer at Lazada, said the company's on-the-ground knowledge about each of the six regional markets in which it operates, its logistics network and the backing from Jack Ma's Alibaba Group will be advantageous in the face of competition.
 ""We feel very confident about what we've built so far — we have a very unique approach to business,"" Meana said. ""Having built teams that have been with us for a long time that function in a very organic way that know the markets, know the complexities that are in each market, which can't easily be replicated. I don't think knowing how to do (business in) Singapore is in any way relevant to how you build your business in the Philippines or Indonesia.""
He explained that the differences in each Southeast Asian market went beyond people and languages spoken. It involved things including the infrastructure set-up in each country to facilitate logistics and delivery, how the syntax of each local language affected the way search worked and also the behaviors of small and medium enterprises in listing their products and structuring their catalogs.
But the region is still lucrative for e-commerce as millions of first-generation internet users embrace online shopping. A frequently cited study from Google and Singapore investment firm Temasek Holdings predicted the region's internet economy to grow to $200 billion by 2025, driven mostly from growth in e-commerce. Meana said Alibaba's investments into Lazada, and the speculation surrounding Amazon's eventual push into the market, underscored the potential of the region.
""We are in a market that is at the beginning of its curve,"" said Meana. ""While obviously the numbers are vast and exciting, I think the opportunities that lie ahead are much larger than anything that's been built behind us.""
To be sure, Amazon has aggressively invested in markets outside the U.S. to grow its stake. For example, reports in India said Amazon has invested more than $2 billion to-date to compete with local e-commerce players Flipkart and Snapdeal.
Earlier this year Alibaba upped its stake in Lazada from 51 percent to about 83 percent, with over $2 billion invested into the company. Its affiliate Ant Financial, earlier this year, merged with Lazada's helloPay platform to bolster payments processing capabilities.
The backing allowed Lazada to move into Alibaba's ecosystem and make use of all of the innovation and features for sellers on their platform, said Meana. Those include offerings like a business intelligence portal and new promotional features that allow sellers to create shop decorations in the same way they would've done for an offline business.
To offer consumers more variety, Lazada launched its Taobao Collection store that curates and sells about 4 million products in English from Alibaba's Taobao marketplace — which is inaccessible to many non-Chinese speaking consumers in Southeast Asia.
Logistics operations, which Meana said is a key differentiator for Lazada, also benefit by tapping into Alibaba's technology, processes and approaches to delivery. Currently, Lazada has about 100 logistics partners in the region and its operations are split into two areas of business: last-mile delivery and a control tower that coordinates the most effective means of delivering parcels from merchants to customers.
 Lazada
 ""For a consumer or merchant, this is completely seamless. They don't need to make decisions or choices — all that is done by us, and in turn what that means is, a number of players that were maybe too small to catch the trend, that weren't able to enter e-commerce, are now being able to leverage our infrastructure and be part of this phenomenal growth that we're seeing in e-commerce,"" he said.
Delivery speed is another way that many online retailers attempt to differentiate themselves. For a region like Southeast Asia, Meana explained that fast delivery was not always feasible. That is, cross-border e-commerce, a growing part of Lazada's business, means consumers are more willing to wait for their parcels, he said.
Ultimately, Meana said, it's about maintaining a balance between being local and nimble — required for most online marketplaces — in multiple countries and having a regional structure to grow the business.
""That's clearly one of the great learnings of having built Lazada over the past five years — the interplay between having this regional structure and the economies of scale and scope to get there and then maintaining the nimbleness of the market,"" he said.
""It's not an easy balance, but it's something that we've invested a lot of time to get to and I don't think it's acquired or built in a day.""

","Alibaba stepped up its push to blend online and offline shopping with the launch of three new supermarkets in Beijing and Shanghai, as part of its ""new retail"" strategy, the company announced Monday. 
 From within those outlets — called Hema stores — customers can shop, dine and order groceries for delivery from their mobile phones and use Alipay to make payments. While the stores look like normal neighborhood supermarkets, Alibaba said every item has barcodes that can be scanned to reveal price and product information. 
""We believe the future of New Retail will be a harmonious integration of online and offline, and Hema is a prime example of this evolution that's taking place,"" Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba Group, said in a prepared statement.

 Users sign up for a Hema membership through their Taobao or Alipay accounts. 
Hema stores were first introduced in 2015 as an attempt to reinvent traditional supermarkets. To date, there are 13 of them in Shanghai, Beijing and Ningbo, and they serve customers located within a 3-kilometer radius to ensure shorter delivery times, according to Alibaba. 
Some analysts expect Alibaba's strategy to lead the market in going after China's large number of consumers who still shop offline. 
""The integration of grocery stores, food-service businesses and restaurants with new technologies and e-commerce has formed the embryo of the (online-to-offline) new retail,"" Julia Pan, analyst at UOB Kay Hian, said in a note last Friday. 
Pan added that China's ""online retail market is still under-penetrated at the rate of 15 percent of total retail market size, and Alibaba has an 11 percent market share of China's retail sales.""
She said it is likely there could be an ""increasing number of new retail stores launched in China"" following the introduction of Alibaba's strategy. 
Alibaba uses big data analytics to remember purchase preferences for each customer and make personalized recommendations on the Hema app. It also provides a data-driven selection of fresh food to customers based on their locations. 
The idea of e-commerce players moving into brick-and-mortar spaces has seen big moves in recent years — as internet companies attempt to capture more of the offline retail market. Most notably, earlier this year, Amazon said it planned to buy U.S. grocery store chain Whole Foods Market in a deal valued at $13.7 billion.

 This article is part of a ""Reporter's Notebook"" series, wherein CNBC journalists submit tales and observations from the field.
 China's shift from a country that copies ideas from the West to a tech and innovation powerhouse is no longer an aspiration — it's a fact.
That was the repeated conclusion last week at one of Asia's largest tech conferences.
 ""China is changing from the so-called copycat nation to innovation nation,"" Jing Ulrich, managing director and vice chairman of APAC at JPMorgan Chase, told audiences at the RISE conference in Hong Kong last week.
China's rise in technology has been spurred by the emergence of large companies such as Tencent, Alibaba and Baidu that paved the way for other local firms to follow.
 Leading innovation at home
 Both consumer appetite and government support led to the creation of new industries and the domestic dominance of Chinese firms in existing areas of technology.
For example, a new sector closely watched by investors is China's massive bike-sharing industry. Though there are several competitors vying for market share, two prominent companies stand out: Mobike and Ofo. They have both raised large chunks of money from local and overseas investors.
JPMorgan's Ulrich said Chinese companies are also leading in areas including mobile payments, internet finance, drone manufacturing, social media and artificial intelligence.
 ""Tencent especially — they're so powerful in China, people actually line up, take numbers trying to see them, to do business with them because of that powerful status""
-Bessie Lee, Founder and CEO, Withinlink
 Part of that success comes from the government's efforts to drive mass entrepreneurship and innovation. Last month in Dalian, Premier Li Keqiang said in a speech that, in the last three years, more than 15,000 enterprises were registered every day on average and about 70 percent of them were active in business. 
Ulrich told CNBC that China's mass-entrepreneurship drive shows the emphasis was to push ""innovation at the grassroots. That's going to help China go to the next level, in terms of economic development.""
And while the government is key, consumers are also driving technological advances in the country.
Alan Bollard, executive director at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Secretariat, said China is altogether ""moving to another zone, particularly driven by this huge middle class which is saying they want a whole lot of new technologies.""
Still, while Chinese companies are innovating in established technological categories, they are not yet broadly creating new classes of technology.
 Yet overseas success remains elusive
 Despite their massive presence in the domestic market, many Chinese tech companies struggle to find strong demand overseas. Outside China, Alibaba and Tencent, for example, face stiff competition from the likes of Amazon and Facebook — both U.S. brands are considered established major players in multiple markets and have amassed a loyal brand following. 
When Chinese tech companies arrive in U.S. and European markets, they need to start from scratch, according to Bessie Lee, founder and CEO at Chinese start-up incubator and early stage venture fund Withinlink.
 ""You see more mergers happening between number one (firm in a sector) and number two so that it becomes easier for someone to take over the market and make money.""
-Hans Tung, Managing partner, GGV Capital
 Lee, who was the former CEO of WPP China, contrasted that state of affairs to Chinese tech giants' dominance at home. ""Tencent especially — they're so powerful in China, people actually line up, take numbers trying to see them, to do business with them because of that powerful status,"" she told audiences at RISE, adding that success outside of China for these companies may look very different from their dominance in the domestic market.
While tech companies figure out ways to conquer markets outside China, the mainland also has to grapple with another key issue — jobs. Its massive population requires about a million new jobs every month while Beijing fends off competition from relatively cheaper places like Myanmar, according to APEC's Bollard. 
 Betting on the right horse
 But China's domestic market is still an attractive investment prospect for investors looking to ride on the wave of technological developments in the mainland.
In recent years, many Chinese start-ups have seen their valuations rise: Data from CB Insights show more than 50 Chinese companies with valuations above $1 billion. For one, Didi Chuxing, which dominates China's ride-hailing market, is valued at $50 billion — only behind rival Uber on the global list of ""unicorns.""
While some argue valuations for many tech firms are too high, GGV Capital Managing Partner Hans Tung told CNBC that it ultimately comes down to betting on ""the right horse.""
""Whoever ends up (becoming) number one in the category wins big because the market's massive,"" Tung said. ""So the premium you pay along the way (is) kind of being affected in a positive way by just the growth ahead.""
The key is to be able to pick one of the top two companies to bet on because, Tung explained, those firms often merge to expand their market share. Didi Chuxing was, for example, the result of a merger between two major ride-sharing companies Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache. 
""You see more mergers happening between number one (firm in a sector) and number two so that it becomes easier for someone to take over the market and make money,"" Tung said.

But there was a time when he couldn't even get a job at Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
 The early rejection taught him an important business lesson: ""You have to get used to failure,""  he says, speaking at the University of Nairobi.
After college, Ma applied for 30 jobs in his home city of  Hangzhou, China. He was rejected from every one.
 At KFC, 24 people applied for the job, says Ma, and while 23 were hired — he wasn't one of them.
The same thing happened when he tried to be a cop. This time four of five applicants were hired, all except Ma.

 Another time Ma lost out on a job to his own blood.
""My cousin and I waited for two hours [in a] long queue to be the waiter for the four star hotel in my city, on a very hot day,"" he says. ""My cousin's score was much lower than mine, [but] he was accepted and I was rejected!"" 
 A post shared by University of Nairobi (@universityofnairobi) on Jul 21, 2017 at 10:38am PDT
 Ma was even turned down by Harvard 10 times, he tells Charlie Rose in 2015.
""I told myself someday I should go teach there maybe,""  he laughs.
Although he can joke about it now, Ma says the continued rejection was painful. But it prepared him for his entrepreneurial future.
""If you can not get used to failure — just like a boxer — if you can't get used to [being] hit, how can you win?"" he says to the audience in Nairobi.
The fortitude came in handy when he founded Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba in 1999. In the beginning, Ma heard ""no"" a lot. 
""I remember year 2001, we went to raise some $5 million from venture capitalists in the USA and got rejected,"" Ma tells Rose. Despite the setback, he didn't stop. ""I said we [will] come back raising a little bit more."" 
Perhaps those VCs regret their decisions. Today, the company has a market cap of about $400 billion. When it went public 2014, it was the largest initial public offering ever.
Ma says he now passes around case studies about failure to colleagues at Alibaba, instead of reinforcing success. 
""When you read too many successful stories, people go crazy,"" he says during his talk in Nairobi. ""They think 'I can be successful.'""
But the truth is, says Ma, ""When you share a lot of failure stories, you learn.""

 It looks like options traders are trying to get in on Alibaba ahead of the company's Thursday morning earnings report.
 On Wednesday, more than two call options traded for every put option. Since call options gain value as a stock rises, while put options gain value as a stock falls, this could be seen as a sign that a high number of bullish bets are being placed.
In fact, out of the 20 most popular call or put options on any stock, two were Alibaba calls — specifically, the calls expiring on Aug. 18, with call prices of $160 and $165. Since Alibaba is currently trading at $159, and those calls expire Friday, traders buying these specific options are betting rather directly that the stock will rise on earnings.
 This sort of action has not been relegated to Wednesday. Stacey Gilbert, head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna, noted Tuesday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" that the stock's options have been ""incredibly popular"" and that most investors appear bullish.
""There's aren't a lot of investors suggesting that they're concerned about a pullback,"" Gilbert said. ""They like owning these options that have this embedded protection, but they want to have that upside exposure.""
By ""embedded protection,"" Gilbert means that those buying calls are not exposed to any losses the stock might see on earnings. A call simply grants its owner the right to buy a stock for a given price within a given time frame, not the obligation to do so.
To be sure, not every call trade is initiated by a bull. On Wednesday, many of the bigger trades in Alibaba appeared to pair the purchase of stock with the sale of an upside call. This structure, known as a ""buy-write,"" offers a touch of extra income which can protect against downside, but in exchange for that, caps an investor's potential gains.
More generally, options prices are currently implying an expected move for the stock of 6 percent higher or lower, Gilbert said.
The Chinese online commerce giant is expected to report earnings of 93 cents per share on $7.1 billion of revenue, according to FactSet's compilation of analyst estimates.

 Alibaba's rally continues following strong earnings   
 2:46  PM ET Thu, 17 Aug 2017 |  01:50 
 This year may finally be the year that global investors put Chinese internet companies alongside American giants like Facebook and Amazon.
On Thursday, Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant, said its profit for the three months that ended in June almost doubled, while its revenue rose more than half. But just as impressive a jump was its stock price, which has increased more than 80 percent so far this year. Now Alibaba and its biggest Chinese rival, Tencent Holdings, have valuations that hover around $400 billion.
By contrast, Amazon.com has a valuation of about $470 billion, while Facebook is at about $490 billion.

Investors are becoming more aware that Alibaba and Tencent have become central to the day-to-day entertainment, shopping and spending habits of China's middle class. Tencent, which offers  extremely popular video games and social media services, reported on Wednesday its own surge in quarterly profit, sending its shares higher still.
But like its American peers, high valuations lead to high expectations.
 The numbers
Alibaba said its fiscal first-quarter profit rose 94 percent to $2.2 billion, thanks to strong sales. Sales across its e-commerce businesses rose 56 percent.
Alibaba's sales have surged as Chinese statistics show consumers in the country continue to do more and more of their shopping online. In that sense, Alibaba's growth is tracking China's efforts to transform its economy to rely more on American-style consumption and less on government spending.
That does not make it infallible. Alibaba's results rely on its online marketplaces, which face growing competition and could someday be hit by a slowdown in growth either from the Chinese economy or from internet adoption in a still-developing country. To diversify, Alibaba has been expanding into entertainment and cloud computing and looking for new opportunities overseas, where it faces competition from its American peers.
 The technology
The strong growth also cloaks a more complicated picture. Over the past year, Alibaba's increase in revenue has outstripped the actual value of the goods being sold on its e-commerce websites. That means that the company has been able to earn more off the vendors who sell everything from name brands to knickknacks on its sites.
Alibaba makes money from vendors by charging them for advertising on its platforms, among other services. New technology and  some of its  corporate deals have given it access to new and better data that give it more power to target those vendors.
That approach has kept Alibaba's results strong despite a slowdown in growth of the total value of goods being sold on its platform. But it is not clear how long it can keep that phenomenon going, fueling its effort to find new consumers and expand into new businesses.
 Jack Ma goes to Washington
As part of that push, Jack Ma, Alibaba's charismatic founder, has been barnstorming across the American political landscape over the past year. A sort of ambassador for the company, Mr. Ma met with President Trump and held a conference in Detroit. His goal has been to persuade more American vendors to get on Alibaba and sell to a Chinese middle class that craves foreign goods.
By attracting more vendors from overseas, Alibaba is able to bring in more big advertising spenders, and support its revenue growth.
Helping his cause was  a settlement announced this month between Alibaba and Kering, the luxury goods giant that owns the Gucci brand and had filed a lawsuit in 2015 charging counterfeit goods had been sold from Alibaba's e-commerce websites.
 The Amazon aspect
As Alibaba looks abroad, it may finally directly compete with that other e-commerce giant, Amazon. In Southeast Asia, where Alibaba owns an online commerce platform called Lazada, it will probably face a new Amazon initiative in the region.
Some have wondered whether Mr. Ma is simply following Amazon's game plan. Just as Amazon has done, Alibaba has started a cloud computing business, bought into a high-profile newspaper, worked to begin creating its own entertainment content, and more recently made bold predictions about unmanned retail stores that will use smartphones to automatically charge customers.
Still, there are some ways in which Alibaba is different. The biggest one is its financial affiliate, Ant Financial, which is responsible for trillions of dollars in money transfers each year. As it looks to expand the business overseas, it has bid for MoneyGram, a remittance company that would give it new exposure to America. As American regulators review that deal, much will depend on Mr. Ma's political maneuverings.

 China has no practical alternative to Alibaba, online retail: Pro   
 2:56  AM ET Fri, 18 Aug 2017 |  01:14 
 Alibaba shares could see a 34 percent rally with the company's cloud division driving a ""re-rating"" of the stock, analysts said, following strong earnings from the Chinese tech titan. 
 On Thursday, Alibaba reported fiscal first quarter revenue of $7.51 billion, a 56 percent year-on-year rise, helping it to beat market expectations. 
Strength in the core e-commerce business as well as continued strength in cloud and digital entertainment and media helped the firm. 
 Alibaba has been one of the most-loved stocks by Wall Street with shares up more than 86 percent year-to-date. And it seems that analysts don't think this story is over.
A host of brokers raised their price targets for the stock following the results which were substantially higher than the $163.92 it closed at on Thursday. Nomura raised its price target from $170 to $201, Deutsche Bank lifted its one from $201 to $208, while Daiwa Capital Markets expects a handle of $205. 
 'Must-own stock'
 But one of the most bullish brokers was Raymond James who put a $220 price target on Alibaba, representing around 34 percent upside. Analysts say that continued but controlled investment in growth areas will support the stock.

 ""We expect Alibaba's vast data insight into Chinese shoppers to sustain its current online marketing revenue growth in the coming 1-3 years, while investment in digital entertainment, cloud, and new initiatives should be under control,"" Daiwa Capital Markets said in a note on Thursday.
""We notice that investor sentiment has improved notably after the recent investor day and thus continue to expect a re-rating of the stock in the coming 12 months ... We see Alibaba as a must-own stock in the China consumer/technology space.""
Cloud-driven 're-rating'
One standout spot in the earnings was Alibaba's cloud division. Revenue from cloud computing increased 96 percent year-over-year in the June quarter to $359 million. The number of paying customers exceeded 1 million for the first time.
 Alibaba has been ramping up investment in the cloud, building new data centers, and expanding across the globe. 
But cloud still only accounts for around 5 percent of total revenues. This could change analysts said. Amazon is a prime example. Investors are bullish on the U.S. e-commerce giant partly because of the success of Amazon Web Services, its cloud division. A similar effect could be seen with Alibaba in the longer-term, according to one analyst.

 Alibaba results read more like Amazon: Analyst   
 10:45  PM ET Thu, 17 Aug 2017 |  03:41 
 Neil Campling, head of technology, media, and telecoms research at Northern Trust Capital Markets, noted that Amazon trades at 65 times its full-year 2019 price to earnings (P/E) for 20 percent revenue growth. P/E is a valuation metric used by analysts. 
In contrast, he says that Alibaba trades on 25 times P/E for its fiscal year ending March 2019, for what is likely to be around 40 percent revenue growth. In other words, Alibaba's forward valuation is lower than Amazon's, but revenue is going to grow faster, especially as its cloud business grows. 
Campling has a ""buy"" rating on the stock and says that cloud performance could ""drive a re-rating to the Alibaba story in time, much like we feel AWS has for Amazon."" He believes Alibaba's valuation will go higher. 
""AliCloud is replicating the Amazon blueprint,"" Campling wrote in a note on Thursday. 
""Baba (like…. err, Amazon) keep drip feeding price cuts to entice more business, more partners, higher penetration which then maintains high growth and reinvestment in scaling out solutions. And as this scale occurs so the high original sunk fixed cost enables the companies to add on higher value add services and new solutions ... which ramps profitability.""

20,2017-08-21,"Google has no cloud business in China, which will make it hard to catch up with Amazon  Stocks that will shine  ","Source: Google
Diane Greene, Sr. Vice President for Google's Cloud businesses.
 In its bid to compete with Amazon Web Services, Google has opened data centers in four countries outside the U.S. this year and has plans to launch in five more before 2019.
 But one big market is not on the list: China.
Google's absence, which stems from a long-standing feud with the world's second-biggest economy, is costing the company business and making it harder to challenge AWS and Microsoft Azure in the rapidly expanding cloud infrastructure market. 
 Earlier this year, one of Google's marquee cloud clients, Snap, cited the service's unavailability in China as a reason that it may not be able to enter the market. Days later, Snap disclosed a deal with AWS, which opened a region of data centers in Beijing in 2014. 
Snap didn't say if China played into the AWS deal, but it's clear that Alphabet's cloud business is missing out on one of the biggest areas of growth in tech.
China's market for cloud infrastructure and software will more than quadruple by 2021 to $9.8 billion from $2.4 billion last year, according to IDC. To build a presence there, AWS partnered with a local company, Beijing Sinnet Technology, as did Microsoft, which teamed up with 21Vianet for data centers in Beijing and Shanghai. Internet data center licenses in China can't be granted to foreign companies.

 Without AWS, Amazon not even worth $100: Analyst   
 1:05  AM ET Wed,  5 April 2017 |  01:34 
 The market leader, according to Gartner, is Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which said last week that its cloud revenue for the latest quarter almost doubled to $359 million. Chinese internet companies Baidu and Tencent also have cloud offerings.
Without a physical presence in China, Google is at a major disadvantage in trying to serve emerging businesses that are turning to the cloud for computing, storage and a growing number of applications and features. Its closest data centers are in Taiwan and Singapore. 
AWS, meanwhile, is in the process of setting up a second Chinese region -- in Ningxia -- as well as opening a Hong Kong region.
Google already has a big gap to close. According to Synergy Research, Google is fourth in global cloud infrastructure with 5 percent of the market, trailing AWS, Azure and IBM. With such a small presence, Google has plenty of places it can grow and is opening cloud locations in countries including India and Brazil.
""Google today is in so few countries -- they have a lot of other fish to go fry,"" said Lydia Leong, an analyst at Gartner, in an interview.
 Google previously explored opening a data center in Hong Kong, but in 2013 the company told the Wall Street Journal that it altered its plans. Google executives have told partners that the company would like to set up a China-based cloud service ""eventually,"" tech website The Information reported in January.
Google didn't answer several questions about its strategy for China, and offered only the following statement by e-mail: ""No plans to bring Google Cloud to China.""
To understand why Google is a no-show in the Chinese cloud market, you have to rewind the clock to 2010.
That year, Google made a radical change in its operations in China, breaking with the country's practices of censoring internet content. Google shut down the local service, redirecting visitors from Google.cn (the mainland site) to the uncensored Google.com.hk in Hong Kong. When the Chinese government objected, Google put up a landing page telling users to navigate to the Hong Kong site.  
 'Have to cooperate'
 ""We heard about Google's plan of returning to China but so far there is not any clear message,"" said Richard Zhao, a senior research manager at IDC and an expert in China's IT market. If they're going to open, ""they have to cooperate with local partners to run public cloud services,"" he said.
It seems unlikely that Google Cloud would make a big push in China without the prospect of core services like search and Google Maps going live there as well. 
But in recent months, under the leadership of Diane Greene, Google's cloud business has shown a heightened level of autonomy. It was Greene who announced in June that Google would stop scanning Gmail users' emails to personalize ads. And in the first half of 2017, Alphabet's biggest growth in headcount was in cloud.
Ruth Porat, Google's finance chief, told analysts that the cloud growth is ""consistent with the priority we place on this business.""
Clearly, that priority has yet to reach China.

 MKM Partners raised its return expectations for Alibaba over the next year, declaring that the Chinese e-commerce company has the ""best fundamentals of the mega-caps.""
 ""We continue to rank Alibaba our top pick among Internet mega-caps and think the company has the best fundamentals of the group,"" wrote MKM managing director Rob Sanderson. ""We think [raising estimates] is warranted because of +50% organic growth in the segment, strong secular trends, dominant market position and +60% margin.""
Sanderson listed several reasons why MKM considers Alibaba's fundamentals the best on the Street, ahead of other industry titans like Amazon and Facebook. The list cited traffic growth, the potential for ad expansion and the adoption and acceleration of e-commerce in Southeast Asia as critical growth drivers.
 The analyst bumped his 12-month price target to $220 from $177, representing 26 percent upside from Tuesday's close. The new target embeds a 30 times multiple for the core commerce business and is tied for the highest projection by any analyst according to FactSet.
Alibaba, the favorite tech stock of hedge fund heavy hitters, recently reported better-than-expected earnings. Since the Asian e-commerce giant released earnings last week, its shares have soared nearly 10 percent. The price has almost doubled for 2017. 
""We think the stock will extend its gains on a very strong result,"" said Sanderson. ""Consumption growth in China and migration to online is a very long duration growth story and BABA's competitive position is extremely strong in our opinion.""
On Alibaba's conference call after the release of earnings on Thursday, Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai discussed the future of Alibaba's ""New Retail"" initiative, which anticipates changes in consumer behavior.
""The reason we were able to deliver these results is that we sowed the seeds years ago by investing in technology, by investing in innovation, by investing in people and by being bold with a vision that nobody thought was possible,"" said Tsai.
""Time, place and method of purchase and consumption will be different from what we're used to before. In this new world of consumption expectations, the distinction between online and offline would disappear.""

23,2017-08-30,Alibaba and Tencent are showing how companies can get around Beijing's crackdown on foreign deals  ,"Alibaba and Tencent are showing how companies can get around Beijing's massive crackdown on foreign deals.
 The firms, among China's most important tech giants, are overseeing the merger of two companies they back. Chinese delivery firm 58 Suyun is combining with Hong Kong logistics company GoGoVan — both have raised funds from Alibaba, and Tencent backs New York-listed 58.com, the parent company of 58 Suyun.
 David A. Grogan | CNBC
Jack Ma, Chairman of Alibaba Group at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 What's important to note with the all-stock deal, which pools GoGoVan's business in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia with 58 Suyun's operations in China, is that it shows that not all outbound deal activity is drying up amid Beijing's efforts to restrict foreign investment.
 ""Small and mid-cap deals are still thriving,"" said Chunshek Chan, global head of mergers and acquisitions and financial sponsors research at Dealogic.
So far this year, about 70 percent of China's outbound deals have been valued at $1 billion or less, according to Dealogic data. Experts said they expect the trend of smaller acquisitions to continue.
That's because with larger acquisitions, ""you start getting questions on national security ... and overall stability and growth of the Chinese economy, so there's a lot more scrutiny over large, marquee deals,"" said Benjamin Cavender, principal at consulting firm China Market Research.
But ""when you're talking about small, medium enterprises, there's a little less pressure — the government doesn't see that as having any way to shape the economy, or cause issues with policy,"" he said.
Since late last year, Beijing has been cracking down on overseas investment as wads of cash flew out of the country, adding downward pressure to an already depreciating yuan. The government also recently issued rules on the kind of acquisitions that would be banned, restricted, and encouraged. Ones that align with Beijing's strategic and economic priorities will get the green light, while others in sectors like sports and entertainment will be frowned upon as Beijing considers them frivolous.
But, experts say, the small deals that are going through are tied to a fundamental truth: China has a growing middle class that is starting to get more discerning in terms of what it wants, and foreign deals can help meet that demand by bringing more products and services into the mainland.
""Chinese companies are still trying to answer the question of 'How are we going to satisfy the demands of the growing Chinese middle class when they want more consumer names and products that are coming from the West?'"" Chan said.
Experts say that at the end of the day, Beijing is still going to be watching for anything that doesn't align with a company's core business, as the acquirer may not have the expertise to make the merger work.
And anything with an unusual deal structure, or one that involves a lot of debt, is expected to still be scrutinized. That's because such agreements could increase risk to the overall financial system, given that they're typically financed by China's major state-owned banks.
The merger of 58 Suyun and GoGoVan will create Asia's largest online logistics platform. Company executives said they have big plans to eventually beat the likes of DHL and FedEx.

 Amazon and Alibaba race to $500 billion market cap   
 5:54  PM ET Fri,  1 Sept 2017 |  01:39 
 Amazon has had a good year, but Alibaba has had an even better one — and it's now within striking distance of surpassing Amazon as the world's biggest e-commerce company by market cap.
 Amazon is up 30 percent this year while Alibaba's stock has nearly doubled as both companies race to a $500 billion in value.
Bulls have reason to love both. They dominate e-commerce in their respective markets (Amazon in the U.S. and Alibaba in China) and both are expanding into new businesses such as groceries, original content and cloud.
 The difference is that the Chinese market — and middle class — is growing much faster and some investors see Alibaba as a proxy for that growth. That's part of the reason the Chinese giant is catching up.
It's also attracted some big names in the hedge-fund space such as David Tepper and Dan Loeb, who have picked up shares this year.
Amazon and Alibaba are getting a lot of love from analysts too — though Alibaba has the edge. Of the 47 brokers that cover the Chinese tech giant, not a single one has a sell rating. Its mean target price is $197.51, about 15 percent higher than where shares stand today, according to FactSet.
Amazon, on the other hand, has one sell rating out of the 44 analysts covering it, and it's about 17 percent from its mean target price of $1,150.46.
Despite stellar runs for both, though, these are some of the most controversial stocks on the market. Especially Alibaba, which is the most shorted company in the world by a mile.
Financial analytics firm S3 Partners crunched the numbers for us.
Short positions in Alibaba total nearly $23 billion. The next most shorted firm, Tesla, draws less than half that in short interest, $10.4 billion. Then it's Apple with $7.1 billion and AT&T with $6.6 billion.
Netflix and Amazon are tied at almost $5 billion.
One of the reasons investors love Alibaba as a proxy for China is the very same reason others hate it. Shorting Alibaba is seen as a way to bet against China's economic growth and broader stock markets.
But this year, those Alibaba bears are in a world of pain thanks to its incredible run. They're down more than $10 billion for the year, and $2.2 billion in August alone as shares have surged 10 percent.
Another good month like that, and it'll be worth more than Amazon.

25,2017-09-05,Alibaba reportedly set to open its first physical mall in China  ,"Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., gestures as he speaks at SoftBank World 2014 in Tokyo, Japan.
 Alibaba, a pioneer of Chinese e-commerce, is reportedly embarking on its first brick-and-mortar mall.
 The five-floor center, to be called ""More Mall,"" is being built near Alibaba's headquarters in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, according to Caixin, a Beijing-based financial news group. Caixin first reported on the news Tuesday morning.
A representative from Alibaba didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
 The mall is being constructed on a 40,000-square-meter plot of land, Caixin said, and is scheduled to open in April.
Construction crews are believed to be finishing the building's interior.
Meantime, the internet giant has been making other moves in China to break into physical retailing. Alibaba CEO Jack Ma has said he wants to blend the online world with that of offline. One example is the company rolling out its own grocery concept, known as Hema.
""More Mall"" will feature unique brands from Alibaba's e-commerce platform, Taobao, along with conventional retail brands, Caixin wrote. It will also have a Hema supermarket store, the publication said.
Hema was first launched in 2015 as an app that allows shoppers to order groceries via a cellphone, using Alibaba's Alipay to ring up purchases.
In the U.S., Amazon is also encroaching on the physical world of retail — especially hurting grocery stores, after it bought Whole Foods.
There are no reports of Amazon constructing its own mall, though. At least for now.

27,2017-09-07,Trump may have pushed Mexico into the arms of China's Alibaba  Alibaba and Mexico have signed an MOU  ,"show chapters
 Alibaba and Mexico have signed an MOU   
 1:58  AM ET Thu,  7 Sept 2017 |  01:33 
 Mexico is tapping Alibaba to help the country boost its trade ties with China.
 Mexico's Ministry of Economy and Alibaba will partner to get more Mexican products onto the tech firm's popular e-commerce platforms. The move aims to help Mexico's small- and medium-sized enterprises expand internationally and in China — the world's largest consumer market with a growing middle class. Alibaba, in turn, will provide its technological expertise on logistics and payments, and it will share analytics to help Mexican firms market better to the Chinese.
""By partnering with Alibaba, we can expand Mexico's export options in China and in Asia more broadly, while enhancing Mexican [small- and medium-sized enterprises'] knowledge of e-commerce and cross-border trade,"" said Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto of the memorandum of understanding inked with Alibaba.
 The deal comes as Pena Nieto closes a trip to China on trade and investment, and is part of efforts to open new opportunities for Mexico, as President Donald Trump has threatened to kill the $1.2 trillion North American Free Trade Agreement, the foundation of trade for the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
The three countries are currently re-negotiating NAFTA, which underpins Mexico's economy — the U.S. accounts for 80 percent of its exports.
 Adam Jeffery | CNBC 
Jack Ma speaking at the 2015 CGI Annual Meeting in New York.
 ""The idea behind Mexico's current diversification efforts, including going to China, is that, in the event President Donald Trump eventually backs out of NAFTA, we have to be ready to start implementation of plan B, and plan B is China,"" said Adrian Cisneros Aguilar, a lawyer and director-general of Chevaya, a firm that specializes in helping Mexican firms expand in China.
For a long time, Mexico didn't need to look beyond the U.S. when it came to trade. But on the campaign trail, Trump said he would slap tariffs on both Mexico and China, something that appears to have pushed the two nations closer together. China reiterated during Pena Nieto's trip that it's open to signing a free trade agreement directly with Mexico. Mexican officials have previously echoed similar sentiments.
More trade with Mexico is something consumers will likely welcome, as many in China have developed a taste for avocadoes, beer and tequila. Avocado exports from Mexico to China, for example, have shot up to more than 10,000 metric tons of the green fruit from 17 metric tons back in 2009, according to Mexican government data cited by ChinaAg, a market research firm.
While growing trade with China can offset some of Mexico's reliance on the U.S., there's still a long way to go for replacing the U.S. as the main trade partner — Mexican exports to China are around $7 billion a year, a far cry from the $300 billion in goods the country sends across the border to the U.S.
But experts say there are a number of challenges when it comes to a broader economic relationship between China and Mexico. One detail that complicates further trade ties between the two nations is that both are competing for more business with the U.S. The physical distance is also an issue, as China has no shortage of trading partners closer to home.
On top of that, while a free trade agreement could be a step in the right direction, many Mexican businesses are still inexperienced when it comes to dealing with China's tough business environment.
""Companies that have never mentioned China are approaching me to say they see, suddenly, it's an option,"" said Cisneros Aguilar.
But success in the world's second-largest usually requires time and effort — what works for Mexican companies in Spain won't translate in China, he explained.
Understanding the environment is very ""important when it comes to a country like China, which is so culturally different from us,"" Cisneros Aguilar said.

Quarterback Russell Wilson #3 of the Seattle Seahawks rushes under pressure from defensive lineman Allen Bailey #97 of the Kansas City Chiefs at CenturyLink Field on August 25, 2017 in Seattle, Washington.
 Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is launching his own platform to help connect celebrities with their die-hard fans. 
 TraceMe, which launches its public beta on Friday, aims to be a hub for in-depth celebrity, artist, actor or athlete content. The mobile-first platform will be available on iOS. 
""I want to connect directly with my most passionate fans—my superfans,"" Wilson told CNBC via email. ""It's a front row seat for them, right by my side, that allows them to see what's on my mind, what's behind the scenes, each and every day. And I'm not the only one who wants this. While on this journey, I've been fortunate to speak to many other athletes, artists, celebrities, entertainers ... many of them say they have the same problem. That they feel they can't give back to their most passionate fans.""
 The company announced a $9 million Series A funding round on Friday led by Madrona Venture Group, whose founder and managing partner Tom Alberg is a director at Amazon. Other angel investors include Jeff Bezos' Bezos Expeditions, Alibaba co-founder Joe Tsai and YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley.
Increasingly, celebrities have been launching their own apps to get closer to their followers featuring exclusive content, including the Kardashians' individual apps and Lady Gaga's Little Monsters. The MLB Players Association created Infield Chatter to allow baseball fans more access to their favorite players. But rather than an individualized platform for each celebrity or specific sport, TraceMe is aiming to be a place for all notable people to create their own online space.
""It's not for 100 percent of fans and not for 100 percent of celebrities,"" admitted TraceMe CEO Jason LeeKeenan, who previously was an executive at Hulu and Zulily. ""It's for superfans that want to go deeper.""
Wilson will still post on his regular Facebook, Twitter and other social media channels. However, TraceMe users will get access to exclusive content like a weekly podcast called ""DangerTalk,"" training tips with Wilson's personal trainer, Decker Davis, and recipes with Wilson's personal chef. Wilson will also take questions from fans, and will have some involvement during the NFL season. However, he insists his primary focus will be football during that time.
""While (the TraceMe team) is hard at work building this platform, I'll be focused on football,"" he said. ""My primary goal is to win the city of Seattle another Super Bowl. TraceMe will help me achieve this by motivating me through the ups and downs of the season, giving me that direct line to my fans and helping me stay focused. I'm super excited.""
Though the only person on TraceMe at launch will be Wilson, the company is in talks to add others in the upcoming months. As more celebrities join the platform, they'll share similar additional content related to their areas of expertise.
""We're starting with my fans, but soon we'll add the worlds of other celebrities to the platform,"" Wilson said. ""We're building these stunning, unique worlds that you can dive into.""

 Alibaba founder and executive chairman Jack Ma turned the company's 18th birthday celebration into a thriller with a Michael Jackson-inspired dance performance. 
 The Alibaba founder began the Sept. 8 performance by entering the stage on a motorcycle incognito while wearing a gold-and-silver mask and military-style outfit. After channeling his inner King of Pop with a few splashy moves and poses, Ma pulled off the mask and revealed he was behind the dance moves. He then was joined by a group of Alibaba's employees who awkwardly danced and clapped to a medley of the singer's hits.

 This isn't the first time Ma has performed at an Alibaba event. He performed part of ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" at the 2009 event while dressed as heavy metal lead singer. 
The company has had a lot to celebrate. Stocks hit an all-time high on Aug. 17 after the company beat earnings estimates.

 Best CEO Johnny Chou: Great opportunity as China's consumption is going up   
 10:47  AM ET Wed, 20 Sept 2017 |  03:15 
 An Alibaba-backed Chinese start-up went public on Wednesday, rising nearly 14 percent on its first morning of trading, despite a launching a pared-down $450 million IPO.
 Best, a supply chain technology company,  was listed under the symbol ""BSTI"" on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company priced its 45 million share offering at $10 per share on Tuesday, the lower end of the expected range of between $10 per share and $11 per share.  But shares were trading around $11.50 a share by midday Wednesday.
 Still, the IPO was scaled back from its earlier proposals of a 62.1 million share offering, priced at $13 a share to $15 a share.
 Richard Drew | AP
BEST Inc. Chairman & CEO Johnny Chou is interviewed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange after his company's IPO, Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2017.
 Best's delivery management system, founded in 2007,  has been bolstered by delivering parcels in China's blossoming e-commerce market. E-commerce giant Alibaba owns 23.4 percent of Best's shares outstanding, according to Best's prospectus.
Best had $1.3 billion in revenue in 2016, and already has nearly $1.2 billion in revenue in the first six months of this year, the prospectus said. But the company posted a net loss of more than $201 million last year, and has lost more than $92 million in the first six months of 2017.
Founder and CEO of Best, Johnny Chou, said that China's swelling middle class will likely continue to push Best's business higher. 
""We just started,"" Chou said. He added: ""I've lived in China for some time now. Every day you feel a stronger consumer demand. Ten years ago, I would have said manufacturing and exports is the engine for the economic growth. But now, more and more, I feel consumption .... is really driving economic growth."" 
The challenge, he said, is staying ahead of consumers' more complex expectations, and making sure the logistics can scale accordingly. While Best provides the tracking technologies and works with merchants, franchisees do the ""last mile"" delivery, he said.
""Competition is going to continue to be fierce, like anywhere else in the world,"" Chou said. ""But we have a great opportunity, and the market is growing at a tremendous amount of speed.""
The IPO also comes as tensions simmer between the United States and China. President Donald Trump has pressured China to take a stronger stance against North Korea, and has ongoing discussions with Chinese President Xi Jinping on improving America's trade deficit.
""Right now, the economy is so global,"" Chou said. ""The U.S. and China are the No. 1 and No. 2 economy in the world, right? So I think everybody's going to be better off — for the consumers, for business — by working together, bilaterally working together, rather than having more disputes. I think people are generally good and want to work with. They just need to work out some issues. I'm very happy and optimistic that things will go well.""

 Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said on Tuesday it invested an additional 5.3 billion yuan, or $807 million, to increase its stake in logistics firm Cainiao Smart Logistics to 51 percent. 
 Prior to the deal, Alibaba held 47 percent of Cainiao, it said in a press release. The deal would give Alibaba an additional seat on Cainiao's board, raising its total to four out of seven seats.
The deal is expected to be completed in October. 
 Alibaba added that it expects to invest 100 billion yuan, or $15.2 billion, over the next five years to boost its global logistics network. The company said it wants to fulfill orders on the mainland withing 24 hours and within 72 hours globally. 
Credit Suisse acted as Alibaba's financial adviser and Morgan Stanley advised Cainiao, the statement said.

35,2017-10-11,Alibaba says it will invest more than $15 billion over three years in global research program  ,"Wang He | Getty Images
Jack Ma, founder of the Alibaba Group attends the 2017 forum on rural headmasters on July 12, 2017 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province of China.
 Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba announced Wednesday it will invest more than $15 billion over the next three years into a global research and development program to increase collaboration and develop new technologies. 
 That sum was slightly more than double the total amount Alibaba spent on R&D between 2014 and the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2017. 
The program is called the Academy for Discovery, Adventure, Momentum and Outlook — DAMO Academy for short. As part of the program, Alibaba will set up seven research labs in Beijing, Hangzhou, San Mateo and Bellevue in the U.S., Moscow, Tel Aviv and Singapore, and recruit 100 researchers to staff them.
 Those labs will undertake projects in areas of data intelligence, Internet of Things, financial technologies, quantum computing and human-machine interaction, including machine learning and Natural Language Processing. They would collaborate with institutions such as the University of California, Berkeley through its RISE Lab.
The program, Alibaba said, will be guided by an advisory board comprising researchers and educators from several top universities, including MIT.  
The announcement was made by Alibaba Chief Technology Officer Jeff Zhang at the company's Computing Conference 2017 in Hangzhou, China.
Zhang, who will lead the academy, said in a prepared statement that the research program will be ""at the forefront of developing next-generation technology that will spur the growth of Alibaba and our partners.""
""We are now looking for talented and driven researchers to join us in the quest for new disruptive technologies that would advance our every-day lives, benefit small businesses and narrow the technology gap to make our world a more inclusive place,"" Zhang added. 
Alibaba said the program will help the tech giant fulfill its long-term commitment to serve 2 billion customers and create 100 million jobs in 20 years. 
Experts have previously said that China was moving more into the research and development of hardcore, cutting-edge technologies. In September, investment bank Goldman Sachs issued a report saying the world's second-largest economy has emerged as a major contender in using artificial intelligence to drive progress. 
Other major Chinese tech companies, such as Baidu and Tencent, have in recent years opened research and development labs around the world to develop new technologies.

36,2017-10-12,"How Jack Ma's foresight helped Alibaba become an e-commerce giant  BlackRock, Philipps 66, NXPI Semiconductors, Microsoft & Alibaba  ","David A. Grogan | CNBC
Jack Ma
 Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma believes that if there's a change coming, it's best to prepare early.
 That philosophy served Alibaba, now a Chinese e-commerce behemoth, well in its early days fending off competition on its home turf from online marketplace eBay.
""When we see something is coming, we have to prepare now,"" Ma told CNBC. ""My belief is [that] you have to repair the roof while it is still [sunny]."" 
 When internet commerce in China was still in its nascent stages, eBay became one of the early entrants into the market. It ran a consumer-to-consumer online platform called EachNet that charged users a fee for each transaction. 
Alibaba, at that time, was still focused on helping small- and medium-sized companies in China go online to do business. 
Ma had ""realized that eBay, sooner or later, as it grew in China, would start coming after Alibaba's customers,"" Porter Erisman, a former Alibaba vice president, told CNBC's ""The Brave Ones.""
To combat that potential threat from eBay, Ma assembled a small group of Alibaba employees and sent them to work on a secret project: an online marketplace that could directly compete with what eBay was offering. That was how Alibaba built its famous Taobao marketplace that currently handles huge volumes of transactions each day.
Taobao, Erisman said, started free for the first three years and it put pressure on eBay's pay-per-transaction model. EBay's reaction was ""to put out a press release and say free is not a business model."" But as more buyers and sellers began to move onto Taobao, Erisman said, Alibaba knew that ultimately it could make money. 
In nearly two decades since Ma co-founded the company from his apartment in Hangzhou, Alibaba has become a mainstay in the tech world. It has a market capitalization of about $473 billion.
Early in his career, Ma faced a string of rejections, which he said helped to build his mettle as an entrepreneur. ""As an entrepreneur, one of the quality I have is that when I'm rejected by people, I get used to them,"" Ma said. 
The transition from a fledgling business to one of China's most valuable companies came with its share of ups and downs. In fact, Alibaba initially struggled to raise venture capital funding. One venture investor recently told CNBC that he had turned down an early investment into Alibaba because he was not convinced by their initial business-to-business model. 
Ma has previously said that Alibaba was rejected by about 30 venture capitalists before it found a major backer in another tech visionary — SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.
Then came the dotcom bust and Ma was forced to lay-off staff around the world. 
""Alibaba went from this sort of optimistic expansion phase to this somewhat depressing phase of cutting back,"" Erisman said. ""That was the only time I ever saw him doubt himself, when he was laying off people, and I think for just a moment in time, he even wondered if the company would survive.""
It was then that Ma learned that being a CEO was vastly different from being an English teacher, according to Erisman. ""Being a CEO means making the tough decisions and sometimes cutting back in order to allow the company to survive,"" he said. 
Ma is already thinking about what the future will entail for Alibaba as new technologies and ways of doing business are discovered. 
""Next 30 years,"" he said, ""the technology is going to challenge a lot of job opportunities. People already are unhappy because a lot of machine learning, artificial intelligence are killing a lot of jobs.""
The trade-off, according to Ma, is the improvement in people's lives as a result of new technologies.
To prepare for that inevitable change, when technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning become a mainstay, Alibaba earlier this week said it will investment more than $15 billion over the next three years into technological research and development.
""What Alibaba wants to do in the next 10-20 years is to enable the innovation of traditional business,"" Ma said.

 Lululemon says it gets good sales from brick-and-mortar and online in China   
 10:17  PM ET Sun, 15 Oct 2017 |  02:05 
 Canadian athletic apparel retailer Lululemon, hungry to expand, could lean further on Alibaba to drive growth, according to CEO Laurent Potdevin. 
 And while the relationship with China's e-commerce giant pays dividends, Lululemon isn't worrying about threats from its main U.S. rival: Some reports have said Amazon is planning to create its own sports apparel line, but Potdevin told CNBC the U.S.-based tech giant is unlikely to pose a direct threat to his company.
""I think Amazon is mostly around commodity product. That's not our sandbox,"" Potdevin said, explaining that Lululemon will continue to focus on innovation and on the high-end of the market.
 ""The fact that we control our distribution really allows us to have a different positioning,"" he said.
As for his company's Alibaba partnership — Lululemon products are available to consumers on Tmall, an Alibaba-run e-commerce site — Potdevin said it's integral for the business.
With Alibaba, ""there is really a passion for data, but not so much for the brands competing among themselves. So that relationship is really powerful and it translates to what we do offline both in our stores and through events,"" he said.
 Lululemon announced in August that it raked in $581.1 million in revenue for the second quarter — easily topping a projected $567.8 million. The figure was also a 13 percent year-over-year increase.
The company has said it plans to hit $4 billion in yearly revenue by 2020.

39,2017-10-23,"A Showdown Brews Between Amazon and Alibaba, Far From Home  ","Hong Wu | Getty Images 
 From this concrete warehouse perched on the edge of a potentially vast new market for online shopping, the Alibaba Group of China hopes to beat Amazon one head of lettuce at a time.
Under the glare of fluorescent lights, green-vested workers carefully wrap fruit, cheese and other perishables for delivery by vans to a growing group of Singaporeans who prefer to do their shopping online. On a nearby wall, printouts show the sorts of defects that customers have complained about in the past: overripe avocados, smelly spinach, rotten honeydews.
“It’s getting better and better,” said Vikram Rupani, president of RedMart, an online grocery company based in Singapore that is part of Alibaba’s push into the region, “but it’s a continuous process that never ends.”
 Alibaba and Amazon already dominate the business of selling stuff online in their home markets. Increasingly, they are competing against each other on neutral ground.
Both are spending billions of dollars on Asia — particularly Southeast Asia and India — as they look for a place that could repeat China’s explosive transformation into the world’s biggest online shopping market.
Amazon has committed $5 billion to India, where it lures customers to sign up for its Prime service, which includes Western movies and television shows, for a small fraction of the $99 annual membership price in the United States. Alibaba has invested roughly $500 million for stakes in both Paytm — India’s largest mobile payments platform — and its e-commerce affiliate, Paytm Mall.
Alibaba’s bigger bet is in Southeast Asia. It has spent more than $2 billion to take control of Lazada, a five-year-old online shopping company based in Singapore and doing business in six countries. Last year, Lazada bought RedMart, the online retail grocery.
The promise is there, as the region’s young middle class grows and goes online. Southeast Asia’s e-commerce sales could total $88 billion by 2025, according to projections from Google and Temasek Holdings, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund. Volume was less than one-tenth that in 2015.
Over about the same period, India’s market could increase six times to a similar amount, Bain & Company, a consulting firm, projects.
Alibaba and Amazon are seeking consumers like Janice Lee Fang, a Singaporean who decided she needed to buy a robot to amuse a 6-year-old daughter home sick from school. Through Amazon’s Prime Now service, introduced in Singapore in July, she bought a Sphero SPRK Plus — a clear plastic ball that can skitter across the floor with a tap of a smartphone — that arrived in less than a day.
“I was thrilled,” said Ms. Fang, who said she also uses Alibaba’s services. “I had time to unbox it and teach her how to use it. It’s a last-minute shopping savior.”
But Southeast Asia is no China. A diffuse area of 600 million people, the region is divided by politics, language and culture. Some places are modern, like Singapore. Other places lack the roads and other infrastructure to get people what they need.
“It’s a mix of urban, semi-urban and rural areas, separated by large distances and — in the Philippines and Indonesia — by water,” said Mike Booker, a partner at the Southeast Asian arm of Bain. “Cash on delivery is still prevalent, and other local players are in the fray.”
The challenges have forced Lazada, Alibaba’s biggest Southeast Asian operation, to get creative.
In Vietnam, local post offices take customer returns and give cash refunds. In Malaysia, customers can collect merchandise from lockers at 7-Eleven stores. And in the Philippines, Lazada uses gas stations as places where merchants can drop off their goods for delivery personnel to pick up.
“We’re in the super, super, super early days,” said Inanc Balci, who oversees Lazada operations in the Philippines.
Alibaba’s international arm has seen its latest quarterly sales more than double in a year, in part from Lazada’s contribution. Still, Lazada and its RedMart subsidiary remain a tiny, and unprofitable, part of Alibaba’s empire. Max Bittner, Lazada’s chief executive, said its Chinese parent has been willing to spend money to build its delivery capabilities and draw more customers.
“E-commerce is an economy of scale game,” Mr. Bittner said. “I don’t feel constrained in any way. I can go after this opportunity with the amount of firepower I need.”
Amazon so far counts Singapore as its only Southeast Asian market, though industry experts widely expect it will expand into other countries. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.

Until recently, direct competition between Alibaba and Amazon has been rare. Amazon has a modest presence in China. Alibaba sells goods in the United States through its AliExpress platform but has backed away from further expansion efforts.
Southeast Asia could offer a test of their vastly different business models on neutral turf.
Amazon owns more of the inventory it sells. By contrast, most of Lazada’s sales come from outside vendors who use its platform as a digital middleman to reach customers. That approach, which keeps costs low, is similar to what Alibaba does in China. But in China, the company’s Taobao platform has been accused of offering counterfeit goods. Alibaba says it is working to fight fakes.
Alibaba has a long lead over Amazon and is building up its infrastructure across Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, for example, it took a minority stake in August in another online marketplace, Tokopedia. Experts say Amazon could fight back by offering online Western movies and television programs as it does in the United States, which could increase its appeal with younger customers.
Amazon stumbled in Singapore initially when the service proved too popular, forcing it to turn away customers. But since then the two companies have amped up their efforts to deliver more quickly to a growing group of customers.
At the RedMart warehouse on a recent visit, workers packed cartons — sometimes nine at a time — from bins holding piles of cereal boxes and canned fruits and vegetables. For those who offer ways to improve the process, merit awards include movie tickets, vouchers and cash of up to $1,000.
Competing in the market is likely to be expensive, thanks to customer price cuts and rebates in addition to expansion costs.
“It’s fabulous,” said Uma Parameswar, a Singaporean who works in fine arts management. Over two and a half years of using RedMart, she said, only once did she receive fruit that was less than fresh.
The enticements make her even more inclined to shop online. She says RedMart gives her a 5 percent discount on grocery bills plus discounts on using Uber’s ride-hailing and other services.
“It’s saved me probably $200 in the last three or four months,” she said. “It’s a fair bit.”

 Should investors buy Alibaba before earnings?   
 3:29  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  02:35 
 One of the best-performing tech stocks this year is testing a critical level, and it could be a make or break moment for the stock's incredible run, according to one technician.
 Alibaba share prices have more than doubled this year, but Matt Maley of Miller Tabak warns the stock looks vulnerable heading into earnings on Thursday.
""The stock has had a great run. It's made a series of higher highs and higher lows, which is always very good. It has stayed above its 50-day moving average all year long. However in the last few weeks, it has kind of leveled off,"" Maley said Friday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" He noted that the stock traded below its 50-day moving average on Thursday morning for the first time since January.
 ""Right now after such a big run, I'm kind of middle of the road, and the next couple of weeks are going to be very key, whichever way it breaks,"" he said. ""It will either rally further or it rolls back over. It's going to be very key over the next few weeks.""
 Stacey Gilbert noted there might be better opportunities than being long Alibaba outright.
""The market seems to be divided here. They do see a lot of volatility heading into [earnings],"" said the head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna. Gilbert noted that the implied move on earnings on Thursday is 5 to 6 percent, nearly double the last few quarters. ""So there is extra risk being priced into the quarter here, … and options aren't cheap.""
She offered Altaba, the part of Yahoo that didn't go with its  internet business after Verizon's takeover in June, as an alternative.
""We think that [Altaba] is an interesting alternative, given its 15 percent stake in Alibaba and given that 71 percent of its value is coming from Alibaba,"" she said Friday on ""Power Lunch."" ""[It is also] trading at a discount on a relative value basis, so that's an area we think is a more interesting alternative for those that aren't in BABA."" The stock has surged 77 percent this year so far.
Analysts polled by FactSet are expecting Alibaba to report earnings of $1.04 per share on $7.8 billion in revenue for the third quarter.

 The tech exec will star in a short movie promoting the benefits of tai chi called ""Gong Shou Dao"" to be released November 11, according to a  statement published in Alizila, a site where Alibaba publishes news about the company and its leadership.
Ma will star alongside Natasha Liu Bordizzo, the star of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" retired sumo Grand Champion Asashoryu Akinori and actor and stuntman, Tony Jaa, to name a few. None of the people appearing in the movie will be paid, according to the statement.
 The goal of the movie is to promote tai chi, an ancient Chinese exercise regimen, a practice which all of the movie participants, including Ma, believe in. He started practicing tai chi in 1988, Alizila says.
The movie appearance, while it may be a surprising move for a more traditional tech executive, is not entirely out of character for Ma, the founder and executive chairman of Alibaba.

The rock star billionaire
 It is hard to find the words to describe the scale of Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce business founded in 1999. It’s probably best exemplified by the numbers: Every single day, 200 million people shop on Alibaba’s mobile sites and it sold $550 billion worth of merchandise in its last fiscal year.
In May, Alibaba Group announced annual revenues had gone up 56 percent to almost $23 billion, and in June investors literally gasped as it upped its growth forecast for 2017 from 45 percent to 49 percent. Its 2014 initial public offering (IPO) was the largest in history, raising $25 billion on the New York stock exchange.
At the head of it all is Ma Yun, the 53-year-old entrepreneur known as Jack Ma, who started the company with 17 others and $50,000 in his apartment in Hangzhou, a mid-sized city near China’s east coast, known for its green hills and West Lake.

 “What Jack Ma has been able to accomplish is nothing short of astounding. It’s as impressive, as or more impressive, than the works of Messrs Bezos, Zuckerberg and Musk.” 
 Gil Luria, director of research at DA Davidson Co.
 But Ma’s childhood was frugal: he was born to a family that had very little, sharing an income of just $7 a month between six. He was 6-years-old when President Richard Nixon met Chairman Mao Zedong in 1972, a “geopolitical earthquake” event which opened up China to the U.S. and led to it becoming the world power it is today. It was also the start of Ma’s Chinese dream.
His journey from rags to rock star billionaire – Ma appeared on stage dressed as Michael Jackson at Alibaba’s 18th birthday party in September 2017 in front of an audience of 40,000 – is beset with failure and rejection. Ma said he was a “loser” in his thirties, insists he isn’t a tech expert and was rejected from a job at KFC and as a hotel waiter and was turned down three times when he applied to university. He also claims to have little tech expertise.
“The whole time I worked with him, he always described himself as a tech dummy. And he always said the only two things he could do were emails and use a browser to surf the internet. So he's definitely not a tech guy,” former Alibaba Vice President Porter Erisman told CNBC’s “The Brave Ones.”

Ma said he was a “loser” in his thirties, insists he isn’t a tech expert and was rejected from a job at KFC and as a hotel waiter and was turned down three times when he applied to university.

 Ma’s secret? His understanding of the power of the internet in putting buyers and sellers together, and his obsession with helping small companies, via eBay-like marketplace Taobao, bulk supplier 1688.com and Alibaba.com, a business-to-business site for wholesalers. The group also has marketing services and a financial lending affiliate including PayPal-like Alipay, which has 520 million users around the world.
Other ventures include a 51 percent stake in delivery company Cainiao, which ships an astonishing 55 million packages a day, and Alibaba Pictures, a joint venture with Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners. 
“What Jack Ma has been able to accomplish is nothing short of astounding. It’s as impressive, as or more impressive, than the works of Messrs (Jeff) Bezos, (Mark) Zuckerberg and (Elon) Musk,” Gil Luria, director of research at DA Davidson Co, told CNBC by phone. Ma’s net worth is now an estimated $39 billion.

A small business vision
 The first time Jack Ma went online was in 1995. He was at a friend’s home in Seattle and he approached the computer gingerly.
“The friend said: ‘Don’t worry, you’re not going to break it. Go ahead and touch it.’ And he started searching things on the internet and he realized the power it could have,” Erisman said.
 “When Alibaba got started, the internet was like trying to sell magic beans to someone” 
Porter Erisman, former Alibaba vice president.
 What did he search for? China. “But nothing came up. So he said to himself: ‘If I can put (a) Chinese company on the internet and allow them to connect with business people in the U.S. and other countries, I could possibly create a really powerful business’,” Erisman said.
So Ma — then an English teacher — read U.S. business books to learn about GE, Microsoft, IBM and Wal-mart. “I was so interested in English. People read books, my school mates, they read English just for learning English. I read English, because I learned so many interesting American ideas,” Ma told CNBC’s “The Brave Ones.”
Four years after his first U.S. trip he founded Alibaba, but only three of his coworkers knew anything about technology. “I called myself at that time like a blind man riding on the back of blind tigers. Without knowing anything about technology or computer(s), we start the first company,” Ma said, speaking at an Asia Society event in 2009.
 Alibaba Cloud
The group’s cloud computing arm had more than 1 million paying customers as of June 30, up 137,000 in three months.
 The business took relentless salesmanship, according to Erisman. “When Alibaba got started and when I joined the company, trying to sell (to) businesses in China, the internet was like trying to sell magic beans to someone. And here was this guy, this kind of interesting looking English teacher coming door-to-door to try and tell people they should spend their money, several thousands of dollars to put their company on this thing called the internet.”
Ma would travel across China on road shows where 100 or 200 people would turn up to listen to him, in a kind of “mass movement” to talk to business owners about why they needed to get online.  
 Financial anatomy of the Alibaba Group
 
 Alibaba Group is made up of several websites, platforms and a cloud computing arm. Most of its 2016 revenue came from its Chinese e-commerce sites. Here's a breakdown of how some of its business divisions are doing.
 
  
Alibaba Group
 This includes e-commerce sites Alibaba.com and Taobao, as well as the Alibaba Cloud and Youku Tudou, a YouTube-style video site.
  
E-commerce
 This includes Alibaba.com (wholesale site), Taobao (a marketplace, like eBay), TMall (a retail site for branded goods), Aliexpress (where people in China can sell globally), and 1688.com (another wholesale site). 
  
Alibaba Cloud
 The Alibaba Cloud was founded in 2009, and provides services to sellers on Alibaba marketplaces, start-ups, businesses and governments, and is the cloud services partner of the International Olympic committee.
  
Digital media and entertainment
 This includes Youku Tudou, Alibaba’s YouTube-style video site, but not Alibaba Studios, which is a joint venture with Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Partners.
  
Ant Financial Sevices
 The financial services affiliate of Alibaba, Ant Financial provides finance to small businesses as well as Alipay, its PayPal-like payment service.

 He also relied on the power of his personality to convince people to invest. While others gave detailed business plans, he simply stood up and talked about his story and vision, Erisman recalls. The founder of Japanese telecommunication and investment company SoftBank Masayoshi-Son met with Beijing entrepreneurs shortly after Alibaba was founded and was so impressed with Ma he offered him $40 million. But Ma turned it down, famously saying he’d take only half.
Ma’s long-term vision is such that he talks about the company lasting 102 years. He told an audience at Alibaba’s U.S. Gateway conference in June: “People say, ‘Why 102 years?’ Because our company was born in 1999. Last year, we had one year. This century, we’ll finish 100 years, and next century we will have one year. 102 means across three centuries.”

 “The only time I ever saw him doubt himself is when he was laying off people.”
Porter Erisman, former Alibaba vice president.

Ma's Chinese dream
 Jack Ma was long inspired by Yahoo founder Jerry Yang and the two met when Ma was assigned by his then government employer to show him around Beijing in the 1990s. 
 “When you look at Alibaba in the early days, a lot of the design of the website and a lot of ways the things were put together, they borrowed from Yahoo. Because Jerry Yang, yes he was an inspiration for Jack.”  
Porter Erisman, former Alibaba vice president.
 Ma built his vision on the American companies he saw succeeding like Yahoo and eBay, and moved its main operations to Silicon Valley around the year 2000 because he had been convinced that was the best way to build a global business. But it was a “disaster” Erisman said. Alibaba could not find the right people, Ma told a U.S. audience at the company’s Gateway conference in June.
“Because it is so difficult to hire people who know trade in the Silicon Valley, San Francisco. So instead we hire people from New York, Miami, all arriving in San Francisco. After one month or two months, we realized that something (was) wrong …. because those people, they know trade, but they don’t know anything about internet. Those people that do not know internet, they do not know anything about trade.” Staff were offered cash or shares as compensation, and all opted for cash. “So we have a lot of mistakes we made, and a lot of colleagues also made mistakes,” Ma said.
 That moment was one of the hardest for Ma. “During that time, I got a really strange call from Jack. He said: ‘Porter, do you think I'm a good person?’,” Erisman said. “And I was a little bit confused. Because here was our CEO who I'd never seen doubt himself,” he said. This was the moment Ma transformed from his English-teacher mentality into a CEO.
“He realized as an English teacher you almost never have to say no. But as a CEO, you need to make the tough decisions. And in that case, bringing our company back to China was the tough decision that Jack Ma had to make.”
In 2003, Alibaba decided to launch an eBay-type marketplace: Taobao. To start with, it was a defensive move to slow down the American company’s march to China. “Listen, we've got a secret project. You're going to have to go back to the original Alibaba apartment,” Ma told staff, Erisman recalls. “You're going to have to work in seclusion. You can't tell your friends. You can't tell your family. You can't even tell the other Alibaba employees about this.” The condition was that they resigned from Alibaba – and they did so without even knowing what the project was.
 “Social responsibility is the key. Whatever we do, we try to make sure that the society is good.”
Jack Ma
 Taobao’s major difference was that it didn’t charge sellers or buyers commission, so didn’t have a revenue model to start with. But Ma was convinced that if you put buyers and sellers together, and the sellers made money, then the site itself would too.
 “And eBay's reaction was to put out a press release saying: ‘Free is not a business model.’ But in fact, we knew that because we were getting so many people onto Taobao because we were free in the early days. Ultimately, we could make money,” Erisman said.
There was talk of a partnership with eBay, but then Ma shocked the business world by doing a deal with Yahoo in 2005, where the American company invested $1 billion in Alibaba. But ultimately, it didn’t work, Erisman said. “The underlying politics of the two countries were sort of destined to rip the companies apart. You can't have a U.S. company like Yahoo that reports up to a sort of a Western set of ideals, really partnering on an equal basis with a Chinese company that has to conform to the Chinese political regulations.” There was also a dispute with Yahoo in 2011 when it accused  Ma of transferring ownership of Alipay to his own entity, without telling shareholders.
After Verizon’s acquisition of Yahoo completed in June 2017, Yahoo renamed its remaining assets — including its stake in Alibaba — Altaba. 
Alibaba also has an advantage because of huge U.S. tech companies including Google and Facebook being blocked in China (although both are said to be hoping to enter the country next year), but the Chinese government is also a threat to its own business people. Anbang Insurance Chairman Wu Xiaohui was said to be “detained,” in June, possibly due to his links with the U.S. Is that something Ma is concerned about? 
“Well, I think, as businesspeople, me, I do everything to make sure that I'm (keeping) my customers happy, employees happy, the society is good. It's healthy. Social responsibility is the key. Whatever we do, we try to make sure that the society is good. So I don't know what's going on with the others,” he told “The Brave Ones.”
Ma talks about three things “you should not touch”: money, power and glory. “If you keep the power in your office, you will be in trouble. If you keep the money in your own pocket, you will be in trouble. If you put the glory in your hand, you will be in trouble. So when you have the money, spend the money supporting more people. When you are in power, empower the others. When the glory, (make sure) the other people have that. Then you will be happy.”
 Alibaba’s initiatives
This year has seen Alibaba push boundaries in fashion, payments and research. In June, its Alipay affiliate launched a “smile to pay” service at KFC outlets in China, using facial recognition technology, and in October it filmed its “See Now Buy Now” fashion show for its Tmall website. Footage from the show was broadcast on TV as well as Alibaba’s  Youku site last month for people to pre-order ahead of a shopping festival on November 11. In October Jack Ma also launched the Alibaba DAMO Academy, a $15 billion tech research lab  covering the internet of things and quantum computing, emulating similar initiatives from IBM and Microsoft.

The global dream
 Go with the flow
Jack Ma started studying tai chi in 1988, and applies some of its teaching to“everything from daily life decisions to business strategy and management,” according to a statement on Alizila, Alibaba’s news website. “As I realized over time, Jack Ma's leadership style was all about going with the flow, not having rigid plans. Instead, you face the things that come to (you) as they arrive,” Alibaba’s former Vice President Porter Erisman told “The Brave Ones.” Ma is such a fan of tai chi that he will feature in a short film with martial arts stars including Jet Li, to be broadcast in November on Youku, Alibaba’s video streaming site.
 Search for “lobster” on Alibaba.com and more than 1,200 products come up, from a red Canadian variety costing upwards of $1,100 per metric ton that ships live from the U.S., to frozen lobster tails for $195-plus. If a Chinese customer wants fresh cherries, they can get them sent from a company in Maryland for $300-$500 a ton.
But Ma wants more: Earlier this year he went on a charm drive in the U.S., meeting the then President-Elect Donald Trump in January where the two were pictured smiling outside Trump Tower in New York City. He said the two discussed Alibaba’s plans to support 1 million American jobs over the next five years and he wants “made in America” to sell to China, he told CNBC anchor David Faber for “The Brave Ones,” in June.
“(There are) 300 million middle class (people in China). They need high-quality products, high-quality services. So I think, when Donald Trump said: ‘We want made in America,’ tell me, made in America, which country did you sell (to)? Africa? Latin America? (The answer is) China. So I think ‘made in America’ should sell to China.” 
 Ma sees a sea change in the way goods are consumed around the world. “I say, past 30 years, the domestic consumption of the United States drives the global economy and supports so many small businesses in America or China to sell things globally. Today, next 30 years, the domestic demand and power of China is going to drive millions and millions of small businesses globally,” he told Faber. 
 “Our mission is to allow those who have fun shopping at Alibaba to truly live at Alibaba” 
Yu Yongfu, chairman and CEO of Alibaba Group’s digital media and entertainment division.
 But Ma is also worried about a world where artificial intelligence and robots take people’s jobs  - and businesses must adapt. He is likely to fly for 1,000 hours next year, he said. “This is why I'm traveling, talking to all the government and state leaders and telling them move fast. If they do not move fast, there's going to be trouble. When we see something is coming, we have to prepare now. My belief is that you have to repair the roof while it is still functioning.”
He warned that while large businesses currently dominate industry, the next century will be more about smaller companies. “The next 30, 100 years, personalized, custom-made is the future. So I think the challenge of this technology is to a lot of big companies.
“So how we can empower the small businesses? You know, the small businesses, not only (can) they only sell things to their village or their own country or even their city. With the power of the internet, we can help them sell across the board.”
 Alibaba digital media and entertainment
The Youku video platform, which shows original as well as licensed content, saw a 100 percent uplift in daily average subscribers year-over-year in the quarter ended June 30, but the company does not break out numbers. Alibaba’s mobile browser UCWeb helped to drive a 30 percent revenue increase to $600 million in the digital media business in the quarter to June 30.
 For Alibaba, as for Amazon, the future is not just about e-commerce. Alibaba’s cloud computing division made a modest $968 million in revenue in the year to the end of March 2017, up 121 percent year-on-year, while its digital media and entertainment businesses including YouTube-style site Youku Tudou and event ticketing agency Damai took $2.1 billion, up 271 percent.
 The aim is for people to spend more of their waking moments on the platform, according to Alibaba’s digital and entertainment chair and CEO Yu Youngfu. “To put it simply, our mission is to allow those who have fun shopping at Alibaba to truly live at Alibaba. So in addition to shopping, we would like them to spend more time watching videos with us, getting information from us and listening to music with us, to come and game with us, among many other things,” he said at an investor day in June.
Alibaba also announced a partnership with Steven Spielberg’s movie production company Amblin Partners in October 2016. Alibaba Pictures is 49.5 percent owned by Alibaba Group, and will be creating its own content as well as distributing it in China.  
Other types of business may follow, Luria said, such as a QVC-style shopping site that might combine with a Netflix-type offering.
“Cloud is obviously something that they have followed Amazon’s blueprint but in social media, they are trying to combine commerce with social media in a way that we don’t really have a familiarity with in the West. So it would be more of a combination of Facebook and Amazon in that regard,” Luria told CNBC by phone.
“Alibaba sees its scope far more broadly than, say, Amazon and eBay would. They see their scope as more like the combination of  of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix.”

46,2017-11-06,Alibaba founder Jack Ma just added 'recording artist' to his list of accomplishments  ,"STR | AFP |  Getty Images 
Jack Ma, Alibaba Group founder and executive chairman, singing a song during the Music Festival of the Computing Conference 2017 in Hangzhou in China's eastern Zhejiang province on Oct. 11, 2017.
 Aside from being a billionaire e-commerce entrepreneur and soon-to-be martial arts movie star, Alibaba founder Jack Ma can now add ""recording artist"" to his list of accomplishments. 
 Ma posted the link to a duet he had recorded with Chinese pop singer Faye Wong on social media platform Weibo on Friday while he was in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. The song, titled ""Feng Qing Yang,"" is intended to be the theme song for Ma's upcoming tai chi film, ""Gong Shou Dao.""
Playing along with online users who commented that his vocals should be removed from the track, Ma joked that listeners would get used to his voice if they just hung in there.
 The release of the song comes days before Singles' Day on November 11, which is also when Ma will make his movie debut in ""Gong Shou Dao."" The film is slated to begin showing on video platform Youku on Singles' Day. 
Singles' Day originally began as an anti-Valentine's Day celebration of sorts among Chinese youths, but has since become recognizable for being a massive annual online shopping event on the mainland. Alibaba said it recorded 120.7 billion Chinese yuan ($18.2 billion) in gross merchandise volume in 2016, a 32 percent rise compared to 2015's Singles' Day.

Alibaba Group CEO Daniel Zhang.
 For Alibaba, the future is retail. And a lot of it.
 This Saturday, the Chinese e-commerce giant will hold its annual Singles Day event, which last year grossed a whopping $17.8 billion in sales, up from $14.3 billion in 2015.
To put those sales figures into perspective, Singles Day has surpassed the transaction volume for America's Black Friday and Cyber Monday events combined, according to Fung Global Retail & Technology.
 The day also far outpaces Amazon's Prime Day, which is the most equivalent 24-hour, online shopping experience in the U.S.
 Held every Nov. 11, Alibaba's Singles Day started as a day for those individuals not in romantic relationships to celebrate themselves by shopping online. The 24-hour phenomenon has quickly become the world's largest shopping day of the year.
In 2017, Singles Day is expected to break more records, as more than 60,000 global brands are set to participate.
Names like Lululemon, Adidas, Bose, Gap, Mac Cosmetics, Nike, Procter & Gamble, Macy's and Zara all have a presence on Alibaba's Tmall platform, which continues to grow. Tmall is essentially Alibaba's online version of a shopping mall. Alibaba is also in the midst of constructing its first physical mall, right next to its corporate headquarters in eastern China.
 This year, apparel is the most sought-after Singles Day category, followed by household supplies and footwear, according to a survey by Fung Global. And just like shoppers get a jump-start on some Black Friday bargains in the U.S., roughly two-thirds of Fung Global's survey respondents indicate they will start shopping for Singles Day prior to Nov. 11. 
""The extension of the Singles' Day event is similar to what has been happening in the US, where the influence of one-day shopping holidays is diminishing as retailers adopt a season-long approach to marketing and promotions,"" FGRT Managing Director Deborah Weinswig wrote.
Although, Weinswig added: ""While Western shopping holidays such as Prime Day and Black Friday tend to focus on discounts, Alibaba takes an entertainment-centric approach to its 11.11 festival marketing and promotions in order to engage Chinese consumers.""
Alibaba, founded by Jack Ma, has benefited in large part due to China's growing internet population and its underdeveloped brick-and-mortar retail composition. Many of the stores in rural areas throughout the country, for example, aren't big-name brands, but mom-and-pop shops. And Alibaba wants to change that.
On Singles Day this year, Alibaba will incorporate physical retailers into the event — especially in the days leading up to Nov. 11. The e-commerce giant has collaborated with roughly 50 shopping malls in China to set up pop-up shops, which will span 12 cities.
Estee Lauder's makeup brand Mac, for example, has partnered with Alibaba to open a temporary storefront where customers can experience an augmented reality lipstick trial. There, Mac will also be promoting its deals for Singles Day, encouraging shoppers to visit Tmall.com on Saturday.
In total, Alibaba's 2017 Singles Day is promising 15 million product listings from more than 140,000 different brands.
Also leading up to Saturday, Alibaba held a ""See Now, Buy Now"" fashion show on Halloween, where audience members could shop models' looks immediately from Tmall and other Alibaba-affiliated platforms.
""The value and reach of a customer-engaging fashion show like 'See Now, Buy Now' is far greater for brands than just placing their products at a traditional brick-and-mortar store,"" Alibaba chief marketing officer Chris Tung said about the event.
During the show, Adidas used 3-D technology to flash images onto models, while watch manufacturer Tag Hauer outfitted dancers in glow-in-the-dark costumes. Gap was another global participant, making its second appearance at ""See Now, Buy Now.""
On Friday night, Alibaba will hold its famous countdown celebration, which will feature singer Pharrell Williams. Last year's gala drew celebrity attendees such as Kobe Bryant and David Beckham.

 Two technology giants in China are vying for gains through initial public offerings on major U.S. stock exchanges.  
 ""You've got this indirect battle going on between Tencent and Alibaba,"" said Kathleen Smith, principal and manager of IPO ETFs at Renaissance Capital. ""The forces are all lining up when it comes to commerce, payments. It's pretty hard to come up against these companies.""
Chinese Search engine Sogou (SOGO) debuted at $13 a share on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, giving the company a market value of about $5.4 billion. Tencent has a 43.7 percent holding of Sogou's Class A and Class B shares, according to Sogou's September filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, accessed through S&P Capital IQ. 
 #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(""dw-chart"");$(window).on(""orientationchange"",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});});
 Sogou is just the latest Tencent investment to go public. Tencent subsidiary and e-book company China Literature debuted in Hong Kong on Wednesday local time in a public offering which was oversubscribed by more than 600 times and roughly doubled on its first day of trading. Tencent is also reportedly planning an IPO of its music streaming unit, and per S&P Capital IQ is the second-largest investor in Sea, a $4.8 billion Southeast Asian internet company that listed on the NYSE on Oct. 20. 
Earlier that week, Alibaba's affiliate, Ant Financial, backed microlender Qudian's public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Alibaba was also behind the September IPO of Best, a $4.4 billion logistics company. 
""Some of the bigger companies like Alibaba, Tencent, they add a lot of credibility to the deals because they're known names,"" said Drew Bernstein, co-head of the China practice at Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, an auditor of Chinese IPOs in the U.S. ""They're investing in basically something that's going public and they know that their name carries weight. If they bring credibility, they bring value.""
With Sogou, 11 Chinese companies have gone public in the U.S. this year, according to Renaissance Capital, on pace for the highest number of Chinese IPOs in the U.S. since 2014 when 16 such companies, including Alibaba, went public. 
Alibaba Group has a market capitalization of $475 billion. Its shares are up about 111.7 percent this year. The Chinese e-commerce giant run by Jack Ma also has several affiliates in payments, logistics and cloud computing. In the last few years, Alibaba has branched out into media and sports with its investment into Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club and purchase of the South China Morning Post newspaper. The latest moves by Ma, who is executive chairman, ahead of China's version of Black Friday, Singles Day on Nov. 11, are recording a duet with pop star Faye Wong and starring in a short martial arts movie.
Tencent co-founder Pony Ma is far more low-key than Alibaba's founder, although the company's messaging app WeChat dominates China. The company reported 963 million monthly active users for the app, known locally as Weixin, in the second quarter. Tencent is listed in Hong Kong and has a market capitalization of 3.68 trillion Hong Kong dollars ($470 billion). The shares are up 104 percent in local currency terms this year.
Tim Seymour, managing partner at Triogem Asset Management, said investing in some of the largest East Asian companies is like investing in a venture capital firm. Venture capital typically can involve more risk, but potentially higher reward for investors.
""Thus far their VC approach is well documented in China and Asia, but significantly less so in the USA,"" Seymour said of Tencent.
 #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(""dw-chart"");$(window).on(""orientationchange"",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});});
 Not only does Tencent have holdings in some of the latest IPOs, but the company took a nearly 5 percent stake in Tesla earlier this year, according to S&P Capital IQ. On Wednesday, a day after Snap reported a huge revenue miss, the company said Tencent now has a roughly 10 percent stake in the Snapchat parent.
""We believe Tencent views this investment as a strategic move and it may explore opportunities to collaborate, especially on mobile game publishing and newsfeed,"" Morgan Stanley equity analyst Grace Chen, who is overweight on Tencent, said in a Wednesday note. ""We will monitor Tencent's action plan, but view the investment as a potentially positive move if it is able to execute as intended; we view it as one of Tencent's initial steps towards globalization.""

 We're gaining momentum with Singles Day: Alibaba president   
 12:28  PM ET Fri, 10 Nov 2017 |  02:56 
 Alibaba hit $5 billion in transactions in less than 15 minutes on Singles Day, blowing the opening minutes of past years for the one-day shopping event out of the water. To put that figure perspective, Alibaba made more transactions in first 15 minutes of Singles Day this year than it did during the entire first hour of the cybershopping event back in 2015. And last year, it took the Chinese e-commerce giant a full hour to reach $5 billion in transactions.
 Within the first 30 seconds, 97 percent of sales were generated through mobile devices. 
The peak number of transactions per second so far this year reached 325,000. Payment transactions reached 250,000, about two times greater than in 2016, according to Alibaba's data.
 Singles Day is a holiday in China, in which unmarried men and women celebrate their single lifestyle. The holiday derives its name from the date it takes place on, 11/11.
In 2009, Alibaba decided to turn Singles Days into a cybershopping event along the lines of Black Friday in the United States. Last year, Alibaba saw $17.8 billion in sales during the day-long event, far surpassing the $12.8 billion Americans spent in the four days after Thanksgiving. ""It's not that we need Singles Day,"" Alibaba Group President Michael Evans said in an interview with CNBC on Friday. ""It's the opportunity for merchants and consumers to have fun and engage in something that's really exciting. It's the opportunity for consumers to explore and find new brands and new products.""

 Singles Day has become the world's largest shopping event as Alibaba announced its sales hit $25.4 billion this weekend. The figure not only surpassed the Chinese e-commerce giant's own record, but is also topped Black Friday and Cyber Monday U.S. sales combined.
 But Singles Day, marked on Nov. 11, is not just for the Chinese anymore. 
Lazada, Southeast Asia's e-commerce platform backed by Alibaba, pushed Singles Day aggressively in the region.
 This year, the event generated $123 million of gross merchandise value for Lazada, representing a 171 percent increase since last year's Singles Day. Shoppers on the company's Southeast Asian marketplaces ordered 6.5 million items, which was 191 percent more than last year.
Popular items included electronics, diapers and women's fashion items.
In Thailand, Lazada hosted a massive televised gala with celebrities counting down until the shopping deals began at midnight. The program aired online and on one of Thailand's most popular television channels.
In Singapore, Lazada partnered with Expedia to sponsor a trip to NASA facilities in Florida in an effort to promote the sales.
""Our key success metric is how engaged everyone has been during the day,"" Aimone Ripa di Meana, Lazada's chief marketplace officer and co-founder, told CNBC. 
""Campaigns happen throughout the year, but this is really the one we have invested the most in and we're creating an engagement and a buzz that is absolutely unique,"" he added, addressing the saturation of other promotional days like Oct. 10, Dec. 12, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

 Lazada worked with many of its existing partners, including P&G, Unilever, L'Oreal and Samsung leading up to the event. But the company also sees the event as an opportunity for newcomers, too.
For one, MLAB Holdings, which distributes Sweden-designed Happy Socks into Southeast Asia, ordered 20 to 30 percent more stock in anticipation of Singles Day, according to Mack Chua the company's managing director. Chua, who ran a ""buy one, get one free"" promotion during the event, said he had only been selling on Lazada for several months.
Following the event, he told CNBC that he sold fives times the amount of socks than the previous Saturday — but the overall sales actually came in less than what he'd expected. ""Sales were okay, but we will consolidate our products for Cyber Monday and Black Friday,"" he said.
Singles Day wasn't only limited to Lazada's ecosystem — other e-commerce ventures seized the opportunity.
One such business was Covetella, a dress rental start-up based in Singapore, which ran an email campaign proclaiming ""Happy Singles Day!""
""We knew people would be on the lookout for deals,"" said Carol Chen, founder and CEO of Covetella. ""Our business is heavily event-oriented so we also wanted to give women an excuse to dress up and treat themselves just because.""
Chen said the click-through rate on the company's email promotion was higher than normal.
""Part of our mission behind Covetella is to help people celebrate life, so I like the idea of Singles Day as a another occasion and excuse to dress up and enjoy yourself,"" she added.

 Ant Financial will use local partners in Southeast Asia: executive   
 11:49  PM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 |  01:59 
 Despite public criticism about a lack of transparency in some practices, Ant Financial is doing things the right way, a senior executive at the company said Wednesday.
 The company — which spun off from Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba to run the massive Alipay digital payments platform — has seen healthy demand for its asset-backed securities, and that's proof enough that it's providing sufficient transparency to investors, the executive said.
Asset-backed securities are financial instruments that are backed by underlying loans and other receivables. In this case, Ant Financial lends money to Alipay users and then packages those debts into asset-backed securities for sale to investors.
 ""The demand for these securities is very healthy and continuing to expand,"" Douglas Feagin, senior vice president and head of global business at Ant Financial, told CNBC's ""Street Signs."" ""That, at the end of the day, is the ultimate barometer of whether you're giving enough information to investors to invest.""
""I think seeing that demand is evidence that we're sharing the right kind of information with them,"" Feagin added.
According to news reports, Moody's Investors Service previously said that companies like Ant Financial needed to be more transparent about how such asset-backed securities are created — including their criteria for lending to underlying borrowers.

Douglas Feagin, senior vice president and head of global business at Ant Financial
 ""The borrowers that borrow on our platforms are our consumers, which we know very well,"" Feagin said. ""We serve them based on the needs that we see for them in the financial services market place.""
The executive added that Ant Financial makes credit decisions based on its own information about the borrowers' ""repayment capability and the needs that they have."" He said, ""We tailor products appropriately to those consumers and it's all those loans that are then embedded into asset-backed securities that are then offered into the market.""
In September, Chinese media outlet Caixin reported that after regulators relaxed rules around China's asset-backed securities market in 2014, more companies became active issuers. Asset-backed securities help companies raise money for both investment and other business areas.
Caixin reported that there are 779 corporate asset-backed securities listed on Chinese stock exchanges, with the biggest group being structured notes backed by micro consumer loans. The largest issuers are Huabei and Jiebei, which are online small-loan services of Ant Financial, that have a combined assets worth $14.7 billion, according to Caixin.
The reason why some market watchers are concerned about the rise in asset-backed securities is because sometimes the risks associated with the underlying loans are unclear.
For example, during the global financial crisis, banks sold subprime mortgage-backed securities where, due to poor lending quality, there were a high number of defaults on the underlying housing loans. As a result, the value of those securities fell and, in turn, roiled the global financial system.
Ant Financial's asset-backed securities are currently only available in China. Feagin said that the market there will continue to evolve and that the company is working ""closely with the regulators and market participants to offer those securities.""
Meanwhile, Feagin also said Ant Financial has set its sights on the massive Southeast Asian market for future growth opportunities by teaming up with local partners in countries like Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and soon in Indonesia.
""When you look at this market, there are over 600 million people. [Gross domestic product] is growing at one of the fastest rates in the world and there's a huge demand, frankly, for inclusive financial services,"" Feagin said. He added that there are plenty of people in the region that are currently ""either unserved or underserved"" by the current financial services system.
""And we're here to serve them,"" he added.

 The Street's top 15 'anointed' stocks for 2017   
 7:06  PM ET Mon, 20 Nov 2017 |  01:17 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer always pays attention to this week, the week where major Wall Street investors ""anoint"" and buy the stock market's best performers going into the end of the year.
 ""So how does a stock qualify to become anointed? Well, first, they need to be having a great year,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Second, there has to be a long-term thesis to justify what would otherwise look like nosebleed valuations. Third, you need a belief that nothing can go wrong for the company between now and year-end.""
Portfolio managers ""anoint"" stocks because they want to show their clients they invested in the year's winning names, Cramer said.
 So Cramer went through the top 15 stocks he thinks will become ""anointed"" this year, in alphabetical order, to give homegamers a better picture of Wall Street's most wanted.
 1. Alibaba
 First on the list was Chinese e-commerce colossus Alibaba, the world's largest retailer.
""It's growing like crazy, and it just had a terrific Singles Day,"" Cramer said. ""Alibaba's stock may be up 114 percent for the year, ... but I think portfolio managers would be happy to pay even more for the top Chinese stock in a year where China again became investable.""
 2. Adobe
 With strong sales numbers and new, artificial-intelligence-based products, Adobe has completed its transition into being a pure cloud stock, Cramer said.
""While the stock's already up 76 percent for 2017, every time it comes in, buyers clamor for more,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
 3. Align Technology
 Cramer has always found Align Technology, the maker of Invisalign, to be a shoe-in for investing around the selfie generation.
""There's a ready sales force for Invisalign, and that's the hundreds of thousands of dentists who want to sell new product now that cavities are in decline — at least secular decline — thanks to improved hygiene,"" he said. ""No wonder Align's stock is up 165 percent. Even up here, it remains cheap for the momentum chasers.""
 4. Amazon
 Valuation means little to begin with when it comes to analyzing Amazon, but Cramer said the online giant is valued more on the sum of its parts.
""The thesis? Amazon's really two companies: a retailer and a web service provider. If you broke them up, the sum of the parts could be worth $1 trillion,"" he said. ""Given that Amazon currently has a market cap of $541 billion, that gives portfolio managers plenty of leeway to buy more.""
 5. Apple
 After Apple's double release of the iPhones 8 and X, Cramer doesn't see why its stock couldn't run more than the 46 percent gain it has seen so far in 2017.
""When the world's largest company has a stock that sells at merely 14 times earnings, 14 times, then you keep buying it on the way up and it won't stop being dirt cheap until it trades"" at 18 or 19 times earnings, he said.
 6. Arista Networks
 Cramer admitted that he didn't know much about Arista Networks, a cloud networking company that connects businesses to data centers. But with a 149 percent gain for the year, he said the Cisco rival seemed ""unstoppable.""
 7. Boeing
 The demand for aircraft is off the charts, so leading aircraft manufacturer Boeing is a benefactor of the surging secular growth.
""These are halcyon times for the aircraft makers,"" Cramer said. ""Boeing's run up 70 percent for the year — this is a big-cap stock — yet it is easy to justify buying it much higher.""
 8. Home Depot
 Even though Home Depot shares have only run up 27 percent for 2017, Cramer said the home improvement retailer's stock could still run higher having gone above its old all-time high.
 9. Lam Research
 Cramer attributed the relative cheapness of Lam Research's stock to people still seeing the semiconductor industry as purely cyclical rather than secular.
""This semiconductor equipment maker just keeps putting up fabulous numbers, yet it hasn't been rewarded nearly as much as it deserves given that it sells for just 14 times earnings. That's nuts, people,"" he said. ""Lam is up 103 percent. It can go much more.""
 10. 3M
 Up almost 30 percent for the year, portfolio managers might be embarrassed not owning the stock of 3M after its seriously strong earnings results in the latest quarter, Cramer said.
""This stock may be the ultimate blue chip for 2017,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
 11. Nvidia
 Investors can't ignore Nvidia's three-pronged approach to satisfying the need for high-quality semiconductor chips in the worlds of gaming, data centers and autonomous driving.
""Given that many of the institutions buying the stock simply aren't sensitive to near-term valuations, any price can be paid,"" Cramer said. ""Sky's the limit. Where this one stops, nobody knows.""
 12. PayPal
 Currently trading at $76 a share and up 92 percent for 2017, Cramer wouldn't be surprised if payment processor PayPal surpassed $100 in the near term.
 13. Square
 Having run 232 percent year-to-date, Cramer thought payment technology play Square had run out of steam.
""Now I'm thinking it might have more room to run thanks to the bitcoin initiative. People are desperate to find a bitcoin play,"" Cramer said. ""Square, by default, is now that play.""
 14. VMware
 Riding the same cloud adoption theme as Adobe, VMware, with shares up 57 percent for the year, has its hands in one of the hottest areas of the technology market, Cramer said.
 15. Wal-Mart
 Even after Goldman Sachs downgraded the big-box retailer's stock, Cramer maintained that Wal-Mart is the only company that will be able to challenge Amazon in the long term.
""That means it's going to be a must-own, which isn't bad for a stock that's up 41 percent but still trades at just 22 times earnings,"" Cramer said. ""Goldman says the stock's gotten ahead of itself. Oh, perfect. All of these stocks are technically ahead of themselves, but that's precisely what gets them anointed.""
 Final Thoughts
 ""In a perfect world, I'd like to wait for a pullback ... to tell you to buy any one of these red-hot names,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""But at this time of year, it's very unlikely you'll get a pullback in the anointed winners, as hedge fund buyers can't get enough of them. But if by some fluke, by some chance, any of these names dips, well, you should jump all over them.""

54,2017-11-22,Online special: Two Boeing 747 jumbo jets sold on Alibaba auction site  ,"Taobao
One of the Boeing 747-400 aircraft sold on Alibaba-owned website Taobao.
 Two Boeing 747-400s sold on an Alibaba-owned e-commerce website for $48 million, making the pair of jumbo jets the highest-value sale ever for Taobao.
 The two ""Queens of the Sky"" were from a bankrupt cargo company, Jade Cargo International, and sold to Chinese logistics company SF Express, according to the listing. The Intermediate People's Court of Shenzhen City had attempted six previous offline auctions, BBC reported, before putting the planes up on Taobao.
The bids on one of the planes opened Monday at 135 million yuan, with 27 bids placed before the final sale of just over 162 million yuan, or about $25 million.
 A third plane went unsold due to only one buyer registering to bid, Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.
The bids still are not the highest-ever sale on an online auction site, according to BBC. The No. 1 sale remains a superyacht that went for $85 million on eBay in 2006.
Alibaba, eBay and Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The sales represent the next chapter in the 747's long history, as the jumbo jets face retirement among passenger carriers, though they are still used as air freighters. Earlier this month, United Airlines retired the 747 from its fleet with a final flight to Hawaii. Delta Air Lines, now the last U.S. carrier operating the plane, plans to offer its last commercial flights aboard its 747s at the end of the year.

 How Fanatics stays one step ahead of Amazon and Alibaba   
 1:45  PM ET Tue, 28 Nov 2017 |  01:30 
 Sportswear company Fanatics has carved out a lucrative slice of the $25 billion global sports licensing market. It has licensing rights with North America's four major sports leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB), plus the PGA, Nascar and Major League Soccer.
 Their deals with the major leagues average around 15 years and they've take a fast retailing approach -- like H&M and Zara -- which means they can capitalize on what it's chairman Michael Rubin calls ""micro-moments.""
Examples include Odell Beckham's one handed catch earlier this year, or when Jeremy Lin seemed to come out of nowhere in 2012 and Linsanity fever took hold. Another one of those unpredictable moments came a few months ago when Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Alejandro Villaneuva stood for the anthem while his teammates stayed in the locker room and demand for his jersey suddenly surged.
 Fanatics capitalizes on the big moments too.
Like when the Chicago Cubs won the World Series last year and Fanatics used Ubers to get championship gear in fans hands within minutes.
Fanatics designs, develops, and manufactures the majority of what it sells.
The company's chairman Michael Rubin says Fanatics is the largest verticalized company in the world -- and that's their competitive advantage against online retail behemoths like Amazon and Alibaba, which also sell fan gear but on a smaller scale.
But that doesn't mean Amazon, which is pushing deeper into the clothing business, couldn't become a bigger threat. To stay ahead, Fanatics is accumulating licensing rights across all sports and going global to capture emerging markets.
It's also attracting investment from Japanese conglomerate Softbank, which invested $1 billion in the company earlier this year.

A view of the Navion augmented reality driving system projected onto a windshield.
 WayRay's augmented reality driving system makes a car's windshield look like a video game.
 The Swiss-based company that makes augmented reality for cars won the grand prize in a start-up competition at the Los Angeles Auto Show on Tuesday. 
WayRay makes a small device called Navion, which projects a virtual dashboard onto a driver's windshield. The software can display information on speed, time of day, or even arrows and other graphics that can help the driver navigate, avoid hazards, and warn of dangers ahead, such as pedestrians. 
 WayRay says that by displaying information directly on the windshield, the system allows drivers to stay better focused on the road.
The display might appear similar to what a player would see on a screen in many video games. But the system also notifies the driver of potential points of interest along a route such as restaurants or other businesses.
On Tuesday, the start-up took the top honor in the 2017 Top Ten Automotive Startups Competition on at the Los Angeles Auto Show's AutoMobility LA trade show. 
WayRay beat nine other contestants drawn from a pool of 300 applications. The panel judges included AutoMobility executives from the LA Auto Show executive team, Microsoft, Nvidia, Porsche Consulting, Sansea Consulting, and Time Inc.'s The Drive. 
The company edged out the other two finalists for the prize: Ohio-based GhostWave, which makes radar for advanced driver assistance systems, and Israel-based Innoviz Technologies, which makes lidar, a technology thought to be crucial to self-driving cars that uses lasers to create images of environments and objects. 
The award included $15,000 in prize money and several other perks. Microsoft offered $40,000 worth of cloud storage on their Azure cloud and consulting services. Nvidia gave the company one of its new Nvidia Drive PX 2 AI car computing platforms, which the company has said holds enough computing power to enable full self-driving capability.

 WayRay also received an onstage mentoring session from several of the judges, including venture capitalist Bill Tai; Norman Firchau, president and CEO of Porsche Consulting North America, and Jeff Henshaw, Microsoft program manager of Quantum Computing.
WayRay will also receive consulting services from Elektrobit and access to the company's EB robinos network, a software network for automated driving. Porsche Consulting will also offer WayRay consulting services. 
WayRay secured an $18 million investment from Alibaba in March. In early 2017, the company entered into a strategic partnership with audio and connected car equipment maker, and Samsung subsidiary, Harman.

BECKY QUICK: ANYWAY, BRADY IS JUST ONE OF MANY BIG GUESTS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. ANOTHER ONE IS COMING UP RIGHT NOW. LET'S GET TO ANDREW IN SHANGHAI WHO HAS A VERY SPECIAL GUEST TOO. ANDREW.
ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: HEY GUYS. WE ARE LIVE IN SHANGHAI. WE ARE AT THE LARGEST STARBUCKS IN THE WORLD. THE GRAND OPENING PARTY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW BEHIND ME. HOWARD SCHULTZ IS HERE ALONG WITH HIS FAMILY. ALL SORTS OF CHINESE BUSINESS LUMINARIES HAVE BEEN WITH US ALL MORNING. ONE OF WHOM IS JACK MA OF ALIBABA. WE SAT DOWN WITH HIM AND HOWARD SCHULTZ, THE OTHER NOW, I BEGAN THE CONVERSATION BY ASKING HIM AND HOWARD WHY SO MANY AMERICAN COMPANIES WHO COME HERE – IT FAILS ALL TOO OFTEN, BUT AT LEAST FOR STARBUCKS RIGHT NOW, THEY'VE MADE IT WORK.
HOWARD SCHULTZ: WE'VE BEEN HERE 18 YEARS, AND MANY PEOPLE DONT REALIZE THE FIRST NINE YEARS WE WERE NOT VERY SUCCESSFUL. AND SO THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON US EARLY ON TO KIND OF CLOSE THE TENT AND SAY ITS NOT GOING TO WORK. I THINK WE HAD TO HAVE PATIENCE, AND WE HAD TO HAVE A DEEP COMMITMENT TO BEING LOCALLY RELEVANT AND UNDERSTANDING THE CONSUMER. BUT, AND, I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS JACK, BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO HAVE FRIENDS HERE WHO CAN HELP YOU KIND OF NAVIGATE THROUGH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND, AND, YOU KNOW, JACK AND I HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER. I SAID THIS THE OTHER DAY. I KNEW JACK BEFORE HE WAS JACK. AND WE'VE HAD GREAT CONVERSATOIONS ABOUT BUILIDNG A GREAT COMPANY, WHETHER YOU'RE BUILDING IT IN THE U.S. OR CHINA. AND I THINK THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY MORE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN US THAN DIFFERENCES, AND THE CONSUMER, ALTHOUGH IT IS A CHINESE CONSUMER THAT DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COFFEE, DID UNDERSTAND CUSTOMER SERVICE, DID UNDERSTAND A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO BE, AND I THINK ALSO BUILDING THE KIND OF COMPANY THAT WOULD BE VALUES-BASED AND THE CULTURE OF THE COMPANY IN WHICH WE CAN PUT PEOPLE FIRST. AND I THINK THAT GAVE US A LEG UP. WE DIDN'T COME HERE TO TAKE ANYTHING. WE CAME HERE TO GIVE BACK.
SORKIN: WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS, AND A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN THE U.S. HAVE TRIED TO COME HERE UNSUCCESSFULLY, WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS GONE ON?
JACK MA: I THINK MOST OF THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES COME TO CHINA TO LEARN FROM STARBUCKS. FIRST, OUR HEART FOR THE CUSTOMER, FOR THE MARKET – WE LOVE THE PEOPLE, WE LOVE THE MARKET. SECOND, YOU SHOULD HAVE A GREAT TEAM, THEY HAVE A PATIENCE. AND THIRD IS THE PATIENCE. I'M DOING THIS FOR 10, 20 YEARS. AND THAT'S A GREAT PRODUCT. I WAS AMAZED BY STARBUCKS BECAUSE CHINESE PEOPLE DON'T DRINK COFFEE. WE DRINK TEA. I DON'T LIKE COFFEE. I LIKE TEA. BUT I LIKE STARBUCKS.
SORKIN: YOU'RE DRINKING IT, YOU'RE DRINKING COFFEE NOW.
JACK MA: COMING HERE. I RESPECT. I LIKE. I TOLD MY WIFE, ""I DON'T LIKE COFFEE, BUT I LIKE STARBUCKS."" BECAUSE THE REASON IS THAT I MET HIM FIRST TIME. I THINK WE DISCUSSED LONG. I LISTENED TO HIS TALK. AND WE DISCUSSED ONLY ABOUT THE VALUE, VISION, MISSION. AND THEN I TOLD MY TEAM IN THE PAST YEARS A LOT OF THE TIME MAKING STARBUCKS, A UNIQUE SAMPLE. EVERYBODY DRINK COFFEE IN THE WORLD, ALSO IN CHINA ESPECIALLY. NOBODY THOUGHT COFFEE COULD BE BUSINESS THAT WOULD BE A GLOBAL COMPANY. SERVE PEOPLE WITH HEART, NOT COFFEE. THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
SORKIN: TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON IN RETAIL HERE IN CHINA. YOU JUST HAD YOUR SINGLE'S DAY, BIGGEST EVER, AGAINST $25 BILLION DAY. THAT'S BEEN MOSTLY ONLINE DAY.
MA: YEAH.
SORKIN: BUT YOU GUYS ARE GETTING INTO THE BRICKS AND MORTAR SPACE.
MA: YEAH.
SORKIN: AS WELL.
MA: YEAH. WE'VE BEEN MOVING VERY AGGRESSIVELY. IN THE FOUR YEARS – FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN WE GROW SO FAST AND WE GOT A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT TRADITIONAL RETAILERS SAYING, ""HEY, E-COMMERCE TAKES AWAY ALL OF OUR JOBS, ALL OF OUR BUSINESS."" SO WE ASKED OURSELVES, ARE WE WANTING TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS OR ARE WE WANT TO KILL ALL THE RETAIL, TRADITIONAL RETAIL. WE THINK WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. WE BELIEVE ONLINE AND OFFLINE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER. WITH THE DATA, WITH THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, WE THINK RETAIL -- TRADITIONAL RETAIL, HAS HUGE POTENTIAL IF WE DO IT PROPERLY, IF WE WORK TOGETHER. BUT THAT IS WHY WE'RE GOING AGGRESSIVELY IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS.
SORKIN: HE JUST GAVE UP ON ON-LINE RETAIL, AT LEASTDOING IT HIMSELF. HE HAS HANDED OVER SOME DEGREE TO AMAZON, AND AMAZON JUST CAME TO CHINA. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?
MA: AMAZON COMES TO CHINA. THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR ALMOST 15, 20 YEARS. BUT YOU DO NOT SEE THEM HERE ANYWHERE.
SORKIN: BECAUSE?
MA: BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY DO PROPERLY HERE. IT'S THE MARKET – MAYBE 10 YEARS AMAZON BECOMES BIG AGAIN, I MEAN, IN CHINA. BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE PATIENCE, GREAT PEOPLE, GOOD SERVICES. AND I THINK WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER ONLINE AND STARBUCKS HAS -- PRESENTS A SHOP ON TMALL – AND THEY ARE USING ALIPAY. WE'RE WORKING SO CLOSELY.
HOWARD SCHULTZ: SO, YOU KNOW, THE ROASTERY OFFICIALLY OPEN TOMORROW. I'LL GIVE YOU A STATISTIC THEY GAVE ME AN HOUR AGO. WE SOLD ALMOST $2 MILLION OF MERCHANDISE AND COFFEE THROUGH ALIBABA IN THE LAST 48 HOURS. THE STORE HASN'T OPENED YET. IT'S INCREDIBLE. AND THE OTHER THING IS YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE STORE IS BEING POWERED BY ALIBABA, SO THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'RE ESTABLISHING HERE IN CHINA IS JUST IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER.
SORKIN: HOW DO YOU THINK ABOUT U.S. AND CHINA RELATIONS THESE DAYS AND HOW IT RELATES TO YOU DOING BUSINESS HERE AND YOU DOING BUSINESS IN THE U.S.? WE HAVE TWO LEADERS, BUT ONE OF THEM TALKS ABOUT AMERICA FIRST, AND PRESIDENT XI TO SOME EXTENT MAY BE TALKING ABOUT CHINA FIRST. THOUGH, OPENING AS WELL.
MA: I DID NOT SEE THE PRESIDENT XI SAY CHINA FIRST. PRESIDENT XI THINKS A LOT ABOUT THE ""ONE ROAD, ONE BELT,"" AND BUSINESS SHOULD BE GROWTH TOGETHER, SHARED PROFIT TOGETHER.
MA: SO -- BUT DO YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING EVEN IN THE CONVERSATIONS AND THE OVERHANG OF THE CONVERSATION AROUND NORTH KOREA, FOR EXAMPLE AND HOW THAT COULD AFFECT YOU BEING HERE AND YOU DOING MORE? I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO DO MORE AND MORE BUSINESS IN THE U.S. AS WELL.
SCHULTZ: I THINK, ANDREW, UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL ISSUES THAT EXIST, I THINK THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT COMPANIES THAT HAVE A SHARED LEVEL OF VALUES AROUND SENSE OF HUMANITY - SO YOU CAN TAKE ALIBABA AND YOU TAKE STARBACKS, A CHINESE COMPANY AND AN AMERICAN COMPANY. PERHAPS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THE KIND OF COOPERATION AND KIND OF TRUST AND BUILD A BRIDGE BETWEEN OUR TWO COMPANIES THAT PERHAPS THE POLITICIANS CANNOT DO AT THIS TIME, AND DEMONSTRATE TO AMERICA AND TO CHINA THAT WE ARE MUCH MORE THE SAME THAN WE ARE DIFFERENT. AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT.
SORKIN: CAN YOU DO THAT, THOUGH, IF -- IF THERE IS DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE COUNTRIES OVER THINGS LIKE NORTH KOREA?
MA: YES, OF COURSE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO IT. I THINK IF POLITICIANS AGREE— GREAT. IF THEY DO NOT AGREE – BUSINESS STILL HAS TO GO ON, TRADE HAS TO GO ON. NOBODY CAN STOP THE BUSINESS, NOBODY CAN STOP TRADE. NOBODY CAN STOP THE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE BUSINESS. SO THIS IS WHAT WE THINK, AND THEY ARE SO GREAT ON THE OFFLINE, WE ARE SO GOOD ON THE ON THE ONLINE, THEY ARE SO GOOD IN THE STATES, WE ARE SO GOOD IN CHINA. WE SHOULD SET AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. THAT IMPROVING THE RELATIONSHIP, THE STRENGTHENING OF THE RELATIONSHIP, THIS IS WHAT WE THINK. BY WORKING TOGETHER, THE TWO COUNTRIES CAN DO IT A LOT.
SORKIN: DO YOU HAVE A TAKE ON NORTH KOREA? I KNOW YOU'RE SPONSORING, BY THE WAY, THE OLYMPICS THIS YEAR. I'M GOING TO BE IN SOUTH KOREA. YOU'RE GOING TO BE THERE AS WELL. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG CONVERSATION THERE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN NORTH KOREA.
MA: YEAH. IT'S TOO COMPLICATED TO ME. I HAVE ENOUGH HEADACHE IN MY BUSINESS, I THINK WHEN I HEAR THAT NORTH KOREA, SAY, ""OH, MY GOD, NORTH KOREA DID THIS, RUSSIA DID THIS, AND CHINA DID THIS, AMERICANS DID THIS."" LEAVE THE JOB FOR PRESIDENT XI AND DONALD TRUMP, BECAUSE I'M FOCUSING ON MY BUSINESS.
SORKIN: OK, LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION. LAST TIME I SAW YOU IN DAVOS, YOU SAID SOMETHING VERY PROVOCATIVE. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD TALKED AT ONE POINT ABOUT THE U.S. -- OR, RATHER, CHINA STEALING JOBS FROM THE U.S. AND YOU SAID THAT WAS THE STRATEGY BY – THAT WAS THE STRATEGY BY THE LEADERS OF THE U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TRIED TO CHANGE THAT. I'M CURIOUS IF YOU THINK HE'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL, WE HAVE TAX POLICY THAT HE'S TRYING TO PUT THROUGH, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES?
MA: WELL I THINK AMERICANS ALSO SHOULD HAVE PATIENCE. MAYBE YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH HIM. WHEN HE SAID, ""I WANT TO DO THIS,"" HE HAS BEEN PRESIDENT ONLY ONE YEAR OR SOMETHING, HE CAN NEVER GET – ACHIEVE SOMETHING WITHIN ONE YEAR. AT LEAST HE'S TRYING. AND FOR ME, I THINK THE CHINA IS NOT STEALING JOBS. WE ARE CREATING A LOT OF JOBS. A LOT OF COMPANIES SUCCEED IN CHINA. STARBUCKS DID IT EXCELLENT IN CHINA. MICROSOFT DID EXCELLENT IN CHINA. IBM DID EXCELLENT IN CHINA. AND WE DO NOT SEE A LOT OF CHINA'S COMPANIES DO EXCELLENT IN THE STATES. SO WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER.
SORKIN: WHEN YOU HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH GOVERNMENT HERE, HOW MUCH DO THEY TALK ABOUT TRUMP WITH YOU?
SCHULTZ: THERE'S A CONSTANT THEME ABOUT ASKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. AND I HAVE – I HAVE ONE STATEMENT THAT I CONSISTENTLY REPEAT, AND THAT IS: ""I'M NOT HERE TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS, AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ON FOREIGN SOIL.""
SORKIN: FAIR ENOUGH. BACK THERE WHEN YOU BUY COFFEE, YOU CAN PAY WITH ALIPAY, BUT YOU CAN ALSO PAY WITH WECHAT, WHICH HAS BEEN GROWING IN ITS MARKET SHARE. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO STOP THAT?
MA: WHY SHOULD I STOP THEM? FIRST, IF THERE IS ONLY ONE ALIPAY, ALIPAY -PAY CANNOT GROW THAT FAST. WHEN THERE IS FAIR COMPETITION, GROW FAST. NO MATTER HOW FAST IT GROWS, WE'RE STILL BIGGER, WE'RE STILL BETTER. SO WE HAVE A FAIR, HEALTHY COMPETITION. IT IS GOOD. AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE LONELY TO TALK TO THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE WE'RE THE ONLY ONE IF THERE'S TWO OR THREE, THEN WE HAVE THE RIGHT POLICY.
SORKIN: TALKING ABOUT CURRENCY— THE TOPIC IS BACK IN THE U.S., I THINK HERE AS WELL, IS BITCOIN. AND WHAT SOME PEOPLE THINK OF AS THE MODERN, LIKE, TULLIP BUBBLE, OR IS IT A BUBBLE? AND I WAS CURIOUS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE GOING TO ACCEPT BITCOIN, DO EITHER OF YOU HAVE A TAKE ON WHETHER WE'RE IN A BUBBLE? OTHER PEOPLE HAVE CALLED IT A FRAUD. JAIME DIMON SAYS IT'S A RIDICULOUS THING.
SCHULTZ: I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT MYSELF. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS COFFEE BUSINESS.
MA: I HAD THIS – JUST TWO DAYS AGO AT THE WORLD INTERNET CONFERENCE PEOPLE ASKED ME WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT? I SAY, ""HONESTLY, I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT IT, AND I AM TOTALLY CONFUSED,: AND EVEN IF IT WORKS, THE WHOLE INTERNATIONAL RULES AND LAWS ON TRADE ON FINANCE IS GOING TO COMPLETELY CHANGE. I DON'T THINK WE ARE READY FOR THAT. SO I THINK I'M FOCUSSING ON THE ALIPAY AND FOCUSED ON IMB, U.S. DOLLARS AND EUROS, AND THAT'S FAIR.
SORKIN: NOT YET.
MA: NO.
SORKIN: DO YOU SEE A DAY WHERE YOU COULD?
MA: WE HAVE A TEAM SPECIFICALLY TO STUDY THAT AND ALSO WE HAVE A TEAM BLOCK CHAIN TECHNOLOGY. WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF EFFORTS ON BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AT ALIBABA, BUT BITCOIN, I SAY NOT FOR ME. I DON'T KNOW.
SCHULTZ: I CAN SEE A POINT IN TIME WHERE STARBUCKS BECOMES A CASHLESS RETAILER. AND I THINK THAT TIME IS NEARER THAN YOU THINK.
MA: LET ME SAY ONE THING. WE ARE NOT FOCUSED ON BITCOIN. WE ARE FOCUSED ON CASH SOCIETY FOR CHINA, AND EVERY COUNTRY WE'VE GOT. TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE SOCIETY IS MORE EFFICIENT, MORE TRANSPARENT, NO CORRUPTION THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
SORKIN: I HAVE TWO FINAL QUESTIONS, AND I'M GOING TO EMBARRASS YOU WITH ONE OF THEM THERE'S A LOT OF SPECULATION IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THIS GENTLEMAN MAY ONE DAY RUN FOR PRESIDENT OR SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
MA: I THINK HE SHOULD.
SCHULTZ: BE CAREFUL HERE.
MA: I RESPECT HIM A LOT HE IS A GREAT VALUE, VISION, AND IS VERY PARANOID FOR THE FUTURE. ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU CAN CHANGE. SEE THIS THING VERY -- I SEE SO MANY RETAILERS COMPLAIN ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGY, AND THEY HATE TECHNOLOGY, THEY STOP, THEY JUST COMPLAIN. BUT HE IS CHANGING IT. I THINK THIS IS WHAT A COUNTRY LEADER SHOULD HAVE.
SORKIN: FINAL QUESTION, WE'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU DANCING LIKE MICHAEL JACKSON, CREATING MOVIES. WHAT'S NEXT, OUTSIDE OF – DOING MAGIC SHOWS – OUTSIDE OF RUNNING ALIBABA.
MA: WELL I – I TRY TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE THERE ARE THREE JACK MA. FIRST JACK IS, AH, HE IS GREAT, HE IS NOT GOOD. THIS IS PEOPLE'S IMAGINATION. SECOND JACK MA IS JACK MA, THE CEO AND FOUNDER OF ALIBABA GROUP. AND THIRD JACK MA IS MY REAL PERSON. I LOVE TO SING. I LOVE TO DANCE. I HAVE FUN. I LIKE WALKING AROUND THE STREETS. I'M THE THING YOU SEE – I'M MYSELF. MY REAL JACK MA COMING AROUND THESE DAYS.
SCHULTZ: I HAVE A FOURTH JACK MA. I'VE KNOWN JACK A LONG TIME, AND JACK OBVIOUSLY HAS BECOME EXTRAORDINARILY SUCCESSFUL AND INFLUENTIAL IN CHINA AND AROUND THE WORLD. THE FOURTH JACK MA, THE CORE JACK MA, IS A MAN OF HUMILITY, A HUMBLE PERSON, AND THAT'S WHY I THINK I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR HIM. HE HAS NOT CHANGED AT ALL.
SORKIN: HEY, GUYS. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME, TOUCHED A LOT OF TOPICS. WE'RE GOING TO BRING YOU A LOT MORE NEWS HERE IN SHANGHAI FROM THE OPENING OF THE NEW STARBUCKS ROASTERY. WHEN WE COME BACK IN JUST A LITTLE BIT, WE ARE GOING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A MAN THAT IS BEING REFERRED TO AS THE WARREN BUFFETT OF CHINA. PERHAPS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL INVESTOR IN CHINA. OWNS PIECES OF JUST ABOUT EVERY MAJOR CHINESE COMPANY AROUND. WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK WITH HIM IN JUST A LITTLE BIT FROM THE CAPITAL OF CHINA. I'M GOING TO SEND IT BACK TO YOU FOR NOW.
JOE KERNEN: ANDREW, WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. COMING UP, WE'LL HEAR ALSO FROM STARBUCKS CEO KEVIN JOHNSON AND STARBUCKS CHINA CEO BELINDA WONG ON THE COMPANY'S EXPANSION IN ASIA. THEN AT 7:30 CVS IS BUYING AETNA, AS YOU KNOW, IN A MOVE THAT WILL ARGUABLY CHANGE THE FACE OF THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. FORMER AETNA CHAIRMAN CEO, RON WILLIAMS, WILL JOIN US TO DISCUSS WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT IT. YOU'RE WATCHING ""SQUAWK BOX"" ON CNBC.

 Alibaba is reportedly investing $200 million in an Indian grocer   
 6:26  PM ET Fri,  8 Dec 2017 |  00:44 
 Alibaba is set to invest $200 million in Bigbasket, India's largest online grocer, Bloomberg reports, citing sources familiar with the talks, escalating competition with rival Amazon.
 The investment would earn the Chinese e-commerce giant a 25 percent stake in Bigbasket and a foothold in two burgeoning e-commerce markets: the nascent Indian e-commerce industry and the online grocery industry.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said earlier this year the company would invest $3 billion in India to challenge local names like Flipkart and Snapdeal, but the American titan has been increasingly facing off against its Chinese rival in the country. 
 Bigbasket had previously been in investment talks with Amazon, Bloomberg reports, before the online retailer's purchase of Whole Foods in June.

59,2017-12-15,Alibaba's latest bet shows transportation is the next battleground for China's tech giants  ,"Source: Xiaopeng Motors
A vehicle by Xiaopeng Motors
 Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has invested in an electric car start-up as the transportation sector emerges as the latest battleground for China's technology giants.
 The Hangzhou-based technology company confirmed on Friday that it had invested in Chinese electric car start-up Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors Technology, although it did not disclose the amount of that investment. 
""As a clean energy vehicle start-up, the investment in Xiaopeng Motors fits with Alibaba's strategic focus in the automotive sector. Under our open-platform approach, we will continue to work with a range of automotive manufacturing partners to benefit Chinese consumers,"" an Alibaba spokeswoman said in an email.
 Local newspaper China Daily reported that Alibaba would have an approximately 10 percent stake in Xiaopeng Motors following its investment. 
The company's recent moves in the automobile space come after other major players comprising China's BAT companies — an acronym used to refer to Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent collectively — have made investments of their own in the electric vehicle space.
Tencent acquired a 5 percent stake in Tesla for $1.78 billion earlier this year. Both Tencent and Baidu have also invested in Chinese electric vehicle start-up Nio, while Baidu has backed WM Motor Technology, another electric vehicle start-up on the mainland, Reuters reported.
Xiaopeng Motors cooperated with Haima Automobile, a subsidiary of Chinese automaker FAW Group, to begin producing its first model this year, although a finalized version of the electric sports utility vehicle (SUV) is expected to hit the market only in 2018, state-run news agency Xinhua said. 
The beta version of Xiaopeng's electric SUV has a mileage of 300 km and includes an autonomous parking feature, which enables the car to park itself without a driver. 
Meanwhile, He Xiaopeng, the chairman of Xiaopeng Motors and an angel investor, said in a Weibo post on Friday that the start-up had completed its series A+ round of funding and was on track to begin series B financing early next year.
 Car vending machines
 Alibaba's move into the automobiles comes as the company attempts to diversify as part of its ""new retail"" policy, which involves merging both the online and offline. The company announced earlier this month that it would work with Ford Motor to explore ways the companies could upgrade customer experiences in the automobile industry.

An illustration of Alibaba's planned car vending machines — automated facilities which consumers can visit to test drive cars they want to buy.
 Following that announcement, Alibaba presented one possible solution — vending machines which dispense cars.
Under that scheme, users will be able to browse car models on Alibaba's Tmall app before picking them up for a test drive at completely automated facilities, or car vending machines. Only users with scores above 700 on Sesame Credit, Alibaba's social credit scoring system, will be able to schedule test drives.
Alibaba intends to build ""dozens"" of those vending machines in China in the next year. The company said on its Alizila platform that it would be opening two such facilities in Shanghai and Nanjing in January next year.

 These companies are in the race to a $1 trillion valuation   
 12:20  PM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 |  04:32 
 MKM Partners predicts Alibaba will reach the vaunted trillion-dollar valuation ahead of its internet peers.
 ""It seems likely to us that we will have multiple $1 trillion valuation companies within the next 1-3 years if the current bull market continues. In this note, we examine the pathways of the six leading contenders: Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Tencent and Alibaba,"" analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a note to clients Friday entitled ""Pathways to $1 Trillion Valuation and Who Arrives There First.""
""An argument can be made for each company achieving $1 trillion in market cap by 2020, with a case for Apple in 2019. We think it's most likely 2021 when the barrier is broken by an Internet company, but think BABA may have the best chance for 2020 despite being the smallest of the mega-caps today.""
 Sanderson reiterated his buy rating and $220 price target on Alibaba shares, representing 28 percent upside from Thursday's close.
Alibaba has a market value of nearly $440 billion, according to FactSet. Its shares have shot up 96 percent this year, compared with the S&P 500's 20 percent return.
The analyst noted online commerce is growing more than twice the rate in China versus the U.S., while Alibaba's monetization rate is one-sixth to one-eighth of Amazon's.
""We believe that opportunities for further monetization gains are plentiful, largely within the company's control and that ad-loads represent a considerable growth driver that is at the discretion of management,"" he wrote. ""We think that BABA may have the best chance among Internet mega-caps to become the first $1 trillion company.""
Sanderson believes Alibaba can reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2020 if it generates earnings-per-share 20 percent above expectations in 2018, grows earnings by 45 percent in 2019 and preserves its 24 times forward price-earnings ratio.
To be sure, the analyst said there were many risks to Alibaba's future including its ability to raise ad load, prospects for its many investments such as Ant Financial, and losses from its Alicloud and other businesses.

 MoneyGram, Alibaba affiliate terminate merger   
 8:00  PM ET Tue,  2 Jan 2018 |  01:41 
 Shares of MoneyGram tumbled Tuesday after the U.S. government failed to approve a multimillion-dollar merger with Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba controlled by its founder, Jack Ma.
 Ant Financial will pay a $30 million termination fee for the breakup of the deal, in which Ant Financial agreed to buy MoneyGram for $18 a share. MoneyGram shares were trading at around $12 after hours Tuesday, down nearly 9 percent.
""The geopolitical environment has changed considerably since we first announced the proposed transaction with Ant Financial nearly a year ago,"" MoneyGram CEO Alex Holmes said in a statement. ""Despite our best efforts to work cooperatively with the U.S. government, it has now become clear that [the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] will not approve this merger."" 
 Alibaba and MoneyGram will instead form a ""new strategic business cooperation"" to expand their remittance and digital payments services internationally.""Establishing this new strategic cooperation with MoneyGram will add a partner with global remittance capabilities to our ecosystem,"" Doug Feagin, president of Ant Financial International, said in a statement. ""While Ant Financial won't have a direct ownership relationship with MoneyGram, we look forward to working closely with the MoneyGram team to make our platform even more accessible.""
It's a major blow for the Chinese e-commerce giant, which has global ambitions but faces a U.S. government that has taken a hard line on trade with China. For example, President Donald Trump is expected to release harsher penalties this month on companies that depend on trade with China, according to The Washington Post.
 Ant Financial is best known for Alipay, a dominant online payments service, similar to PayPal, that had been part of Alibaba but separated after when Alibaba went public in 2014. Ant Financial itself is considered a top IPO candidate — thought in October 2017, the company reportedly decided to put its offering on hold as it expanded investments in start-ups.
MoneyGram, the second-largest money transfer company in the world, has a long history of dealing with multinational money transfers, dating back to the 1940s, and could have helped Ant Financial's prospects. But according to Reuters, the protection of personal data raised concerns for U.S. regulators.

 About half of ZTO's parcels are handled by machines   
 1:26  AM ET Tue,  9 Jan 2018 |  02:25 
 Chinese logistics company ZTO Express said Tuesday the allegations by a U.S. pension fund that it exaggerated its profit margins have no merit.
 The company was sued by Birmingham Retirement and Relief System. The pension fund alleged that ZTO left out certain low-margin business segments from its financial statements in order to inflate overall profit margins to lure investors into its initial public offering in 2016.
ZTO's $1.4 billion listing in the U.S. was the largest that year, according to Reuters. The company counts e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com as its customers.
 ""We don't think those allegations have any merits, we'll defend ourselves rigorously. We have engaged U.S. lawyers to help us, to protect the rights of the company,"" James Guo, ZTO's chief financial officer, told CNBC at the Morgan Stanley China Technology, Media and Telecomm Conference in Beijing.
Despite the ongoing lawsuit, the company has continued to outpace the industry's average volume growth in China, Guo claimed without revealing numbers. He said, however, the company processed more than 100 million orders on Singles Day last year — among the highest volume handled by a courier in the country.
Singles Day, started as a kind of anti-Valentine's day for singles, has become one of the largest shopping events in the world along with Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

Founder and Chairman of Alibaba Group Jack Ma present at the 'Ma Yun Rural Teachers Prize' awards show on January 22, 2018 in Sanya , Hainan province, China.
 Billionaire business magnate Jack Ma is calling on other entrepreneurs to support his plans to lift millions of poor Chinese children out of poverty and give them better access to education.
 The founder and executive chairman of e-commerce behemoth Alibaba said that investing in rural boarding schools could provide a solution for China's ""left-behind children"" and ensure a more prosperous future for the next generation.
""Left-behind children"" is a phenomenon in China which refers to the growing number of youth who are left in rural communities while their parents relocate to urban areas to find work. For the estimated 60 million children afflicted by the problem, education is a particular issue — kids in rural communities are expected to travel an average of 5.4 kilometers from home to school, according to China's Ministry of Education.

Wang Fuman, also known as 'Frost Boy', walks on the road in Ludian in China's southwestern Yunnan province on January 12, 2018.
 At an event organized by his charitable foundation on Sunday, Ma told a room of 80 entrepreneurs that establishing a network of boarding schools would improve education standards and save children from often difficult commutes.
""Many pupils have to climb mountains or take a boat to go to school. In my opinion, these kids should not be commuting between home and school every day — they should go to a boarding school,"" Ma said in comments first cited by the South China Morning Post, which is owned by Alibaba.

 The plight of China's left-behind children rose to new prominence earlier in January after an image of eight-year-old boy, Wang Fuman, became an internet sensation. The child — deemed  ""Ice Boy"" — had arrived at school with his hair and eyebrows covered in ice after walking for over an hour along treacherous mountain paths to get to school.
Ma said the image reminded him of a young girl he had seen making a similar commute more than 25 years ago in 1992.
""So many years have passed and the situation hasn't changed,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean that the authorities haven't done anything about it, but that the resources can't reach some remote places,"" Ma said, according to SCMP.
He acknowledged the efforts of the Chinese government to improve education, but said that Chinese entrepreneurs could also do more by donating to their home provinces.
""I hope we entrepreneurs can push this plan to merge school resources. I encourage all of you to participate and make a contribution to your home provinces by building dormitories and donating school buses,"" Ma said, according to the report.

Founder and Chairman of Alibaba Group Jack Ma present at the 'Ma Yun Rural Teachers Prize' awards show on January 22, 2018 in Sanya , Hainan province, China.
 The tycoon said he envisions merging rural schools that have under 100 students. Those new groups could be made into boarding schools, with a bus service to collect children from their villages on Mondays and return them to their homes on Fridays.
He added that the plan could provide employment for locals who could be hired as dormitory supervisors.
The event, hosted by the Jack Ma Foundation in Sanya, Hainan Island, was attended by prominent Chinese business leaders, including Beijing property tycoon Feng Lun and co-founder of private equity firm Yunfeng Capita, Yu Feng, according to the SCMP.
Ma has long espoused the benefits of education and has credited his English teacher in his hometown of Hangzhou with giving him the confidence to pursue his first vocational pursuit: teaching English.

Jack Ma, founder of the Alibaba Group attends the 2017 forum on rural headmasters on July 12, 2017 in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province of China.
 In what appears to be a thinly-veiled attack on the U.S. administration, the founder and executive chairman of the e-commerce behemoth Alibaba said trade should not be used as a weapon.
 ""Don't use trade as the weapon, use trade as the solution to solve the problems,"" Jack Ma said at a panel on the future of e-commerce at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 
President Donald Trump has embraced the idea that the U.S. trade deficit should be dramatically reduced or eliminated if America is to grow its economy. This week the U.S. appeared to kick off its new aggressive policy on trade by imposing big tariffs on solar equipment and washing machines from China. 
 Also on Wednesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross appeared to suggest that the United States was ready to enter into trade wars. Speaking at a press conference in Davos, he said: ""There have always been trade wars. The difference now is U.S. troops are now coming to the ramparts.""
In contrast, Ma said he believed that globalization was ultimately a ""great thing"" and its side effects have to be accepted.
""Globalization is a growing pain. It is so easy to launch a trade war but it is so difficult to stop a trade war and I'm scared and concerned,"" he said.
Ma said that to launch a trade war is easy but it can take as long as thirty years to fix the problems that it causes. The Alibaba boss has previously stated that war starts when trade stops.

 According to the World Economic Forum, e-commerce sales worldwide hit an estimated $25.3 trillion in 2015 and are likely to have grown since.
The internet entrepreneur said he expected a future where there would be no ""Made in China"" or   ""Made in America"" and everything would simply be made on the internet.

 In a follow-up question and answer session, Ma said he expected new technology to cause social problems.
""The AI and robots are going to kill a lot of jobs because in the future it'll be done by machines,"" he said
Ma then issued a doomsday warning on where rapid tech development could lead.
""The first technology revolution caused the First World War and the second technology revolution caused the Second World War - and now we have the third.""
The Alibaba boss said he hoped any next world war would be ""against disease, pollution, and poverty, not a war against ourselves.""

 Trader sees more record highs for Alibaba   
 4:21  PM ET Thu, 25 Jan 2018 |  03:37 
 Alibaba hit a new record intraday high on Thursday, and TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon says the stock will see even more new highs when it reports earnings next Thursday.
 ""The stock had been consolidating in September, October and right through the end of 2017,"" he said Thursday on CNBC's""Trading Nation."" But in 2018, markets overseas are booming, he said. ""We're seeing a nice push up.""
This breakout of consolidation leads Gordon to believe the next leg up is upon us. He also noted that the stock broke above resistance at $190, which becomes support. He establishes this as a key level to watch into earnings.
 To take advantage of the rising implied volatility, or the price of options, going into Alibaba, Gordon wants to make a bullish bet on the stock by selling a put spread. Specifically, he is selling the Feb. 2 weekly 192-strike calls and buying the Feb. 2 weekly 197-strike calls for $1.95 credit. This means that if Alibaba closes above $197 on Feb. 2 expiration, then Gordon would receive the $195 credit on the trade.
If Alibaba closes below $192 on Feb. 2 expiration, Gordon could lose $304. However, because Alibaba is already trading at $198.24, above the higher put strike level in Gordon's trade, he believes that the probability of the stock dropping by that much is small.
So far this year, Alibaba has soared about 15 percent.

""When you are 50 to 60 years old, spend time training and developing young people, the next generation,"" Ma added. ""When you are over 60 years old, you better stay with your grandchildren.""

 Billionaire restaurateur: If you want to be successful, don't throw in the towel too quickly   
 8:29  AM ET Wed, 24 Jan 2018 |  01:03 
 Ma said people in their 20s and 30s are ""the luckiest"" because they still have so much to learn.
Instead of setting your goals and aspirations based on others' success stories, Ma recommended making yourself your own competition. You can do this by imagining what you hope to succeed in 10 years, a method that worked for him.
""As a young boy — even today — I never thought I would be here,"" he said. ""When I look back, every problem I met when I was a kid benefited me,"" Ma said.
""I failed so many times, people probably know that I applied for so many jobs, over 30 jobs, all rejected, not even got a chance: 24 of us interviewed for a KFC job, 23 got accepted, I was the only guy rejected,"" he explained.
Ma also discussed the time he applied for a ""police job"" with five other people. He was the only person from the group to be rejected. Another time, he and his cousin applied for jobs as servers at a four-star hotel. ""We waited [in a] long queue for two hours,"" Ma said. Although his cousin got the job, he received a rejection yet again.
While he said his mother shook her head at him, he refused to feel discouraged, thinking, ""I know this is a training course for me.""
Though he says he felt like a failure before reaching his 30s, Ma never gave up. He made himself his own competition, pictured what he hoped to accomplish in 10 years and did everything he could to accomplish that goal.
""No matter how smart you are, you will encounter mistakes,"" Ma said. ""You learn from mistakes not because you will be able to avoid mistakes when these mistakes come, [when] these suffers come, you learn how to deal with it, how to face it.""

 ""From assembling cellphones to fixing the hard-to-reach parts of your cars to performing surgical procedures, robots serve humans well. But a lingering question remains: what happens when robots develop a personality of their own?"" wrote Alibaba's Jenny W. Hsu on the company's news website Alizila on Wednesday.
""Steel Soldiers"" will feature a disgraced special forces officer who has to train android soldiers so that they become an elite army. Hsu described the movie as ""a feature film that explores a futuristic world where humans and androids fight side-by-side."" The military officers will embark on a deadline mission to rescue the robots' creator, she added.

 Jack Ma: Humans will win over machines   
 8:58  AM ET Wed, 21 June 2017 |  00:36 
 Alibaba founder Jack Ma has said he is concerned about the number of jobs that automation will take from humans and that the next 30 years will be painful because of it. But the company expanded its AI cloud product into Europe in a challenge to the likes of Amazon and Microsoft last June and has several data centers in joint ventures around the world.
The movie is a tie-up between the Chinese company's film studio Alibaba Pictures and U.S.-led STX Entertainment and will be produced by Robert Zemeckis, director of ""Back to the Future"" and ""Forrest Gump."" No casting details or release date have been published.
""As a global media company with strong ties to China, STX is thrilled to collaborate with Alibaba Pictures, a trailblazer in today's global tech and direct-to-consumer market, to bring audiences around the world smart, engaging and entertaining content,"" STX said on the Alizila website.
Alibaba is moving into movies with investments in Steven Spielberg's Amblin Partners and China's Wanda Film, while rival tech company Tencent is an investor in STX Entertainment.
