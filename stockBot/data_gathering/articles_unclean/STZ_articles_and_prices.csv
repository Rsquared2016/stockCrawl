 Cramer ranks the brewers   
 8:07  PM ET Mon, 10 April 2017 |  02:31 
 In light of Constellation Brands' success in the beer space, Jim Cramer turned to its competitors to flesh out the players that could really pour some gains into your portfolio.
 First Cramer turned to Anheuser-Busch InBev, the Belgium-based parent of Budweiser and the largest brewer in the world, thanks to its September acquisition of SABMiller.
""With its vast scale, BUD can spread out its marketing costs and take advantage of all sorts of commercial opportunities that might not be available to smaller brewers,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Nobody even comes close to these guys.""
 But Anheuser-Busch's last earnings report was a slight miss, with revenues topping expectations but earnings taking a hit due to the SABMiller purchase. Total volumes also declined 3.3 percent despite positive rhetoric from management.

 ""Put it all together and the numbers don't paint a very flattering picture,"" Cramer said. ""In short, while I'm an avid drinker of Bud Light ... BUD's stock really seems like nothing to write home about, except for that 3 percent yield.""
Next Cramer looked into The Boston Beer Company, known for its Sam Adams beer brand. The company has been embroiled in a battle of the craft beers as smaller, more hip brands chip away at its market share.
""The issue here is whether Boston Beer has finally bottomed,"" Cramer said. Boston Beer beat analyst expectations in its February earnings report, but management gave a very wide range for its 2017 earnings forecast, suggesting that they are not clear yet on whether the year will be good or bad.
Cramer added that the company is in the throes of looking for a new CEO, which means it could take a while for the company to get back on track.
Third came Molson Coors, parent of Miller Lite, Coors Lite, Blue Moon, and Keystone, as well as the second-largest brewer in the United States.
Molson Coors was a big benefactor of the Anheuser-Busch-SABMiller deal, snagging the rest of the MillerCoors venture for a mere $12 billion, but Cramer worries that weak performance in the domestic premium beer segment could mean a tipsy future for the company.
""At this point, the story's all about the fact that they bought the MillerCoors joint venture for a song. And while that could be a decent narrative, it's not exactly the kind of organic growth that money managers really salivate over,"" he said.
At the end of the day, Constellation Brands seems to be the consistent go-to for growth and libations alike.
""Constellation's brands are on fire, including terrific Mexican beers like Modelo and Corona, and [one] we had a hard time keeping in stock this weekend at Bar San Miguel: Pacifico,"" Cramer said.
The company has perpetually delivered double-digit revenue growth, strong cash flow and earnings beats, and has been scooping up market share nationwide by acquiring small craft beer makers and other brands in popular segments.
And while Constellation would be at risk if Congress passed a border-adjusted tax, as the company imports many of its beers from Mexico, Cramer thinks the tax passing is unlikely.
""Constellation Brands has become the undisputed king of the beer space, with incredible growth that its competitors would kill for. I would make a case for Molson Coors or BUD, but honestly, Constellation's best of breed. It's the one you should own, especially when the market gives you the periodic border tax dip,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.

 Brown-Forman not interested in selling to Constellation: Sources   
 3:27  PM ET Tue, 23 May 2017 |  02:30 
 Constellation Brands, the owner of Corona and Svedka Vodka, has made an approach to acquire Jack Daniel's owner Brown-Forman, people with knowledge of the matter said.
 Brown-Forman said it was not interested in selling, but informed the board of Constellation Brands' interest, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing private information.
Terms of any potential offer could not be learned, but Brown-Forman's market cap is hovering around $22 billion. There are no ongoing talks, one of the people said. But Constellation remains interested in a potential merger. 
 The Brown family, who are fifth-generation owners of Brown-Forman, own a majority of the voting power and have indicated historically that they do not want to sell their company.
Shares of Brown-Forman have gained 12 percent over the last week, amid takeover rumors.
The stock rose 4.9 percent on the report of the deal Tuesday, before being halted briefly. When trading resumed, Brown shares gave back those gains and turned sharply lower. They were recently down nearly 6 percent. 
A representative for Brown-Forman declined to comment. A representative for Constellation Brands did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.

 Constellation Brands CEO on untapped upside for top products

 It may not seem like Constellation Brands, the owner of Corona beer and Svedka vodka, could do much to meaningfully improve its already robust business, but CEO Rob Sands says there is even more to be done.
 Between sips of the company's top-of-the-line wines and liquors, Sands and ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer discussed one tactic that could still boost Constellation's business: getting retailers to prioritize its products.
""We call that category management, where we go in and we give advice, objective advice, to retailers about how they should, for instance, set their shelves,"" Sands told Cramer on Tuesday. ""And obviously, they should be allocating more shelf space to the higher-margin, faster-moving premium items. So, again, our portfolio — Corona, Modelo Especial, Pacifico — these are very high-margin beers, very fast-moving items, and they actually are under-allocated shelf space.""
 Constellation Brands' stock is up over 26 percent year to date thanks in part to its iconic beer brands and its growing liquor category.

 Constellation Brands CEO says there's 'huge' untapped upside for his alcohol giant's top products   
 6:51  PM ET Tue, 11 July 2017 |  11:06 
 ""We've had dramatic success with Corona, Modelo Especial has now become the No. 2 import in the United States, and Pacifico is coming up right behind it. It's going to be a fantastic, fantastic growth driver,"" Sands said. ""The demographics are in our favor, so it's all great.""
But the next step is getting retailers to recognize that, the CEO said. While giant alcohol producers like Constellation do sell some of their higher-end products directly to consumers, retailers like liquor stores and alcohol distributors conduct most of the sales.
""It is the next leg, which really goes to the fact that there's huge upside, even in this portfolio, because as we are able to expand shelf space, we get more pack sizes in there,"" Sands told Cramer. ""As retailers start realizing that they're over-allocated to low-margin, low-growth brands and they need to allocate more space to higher-margin, their go-to is going to be the Constellation portfolio. Period.""
The shelving shuffle would give even more exposure to Constellation's red-hot Corona and Modelo Especial brands, a clear boon to the company's already stellar bottom line.
When it comes to consumer loyalty, however, Sands could not quite define what makes customers favor his company's beers above others.
""How does a beer get hot? First of all, if anybody had the answer to that, we probably wouldn't be sitting here even having this chat,"" he told Cramer. ""But it's really about consumers voting with their feet, OK? It's the consumer who makes any product, really in any industry, but in particular beer. It's what makes a beer hot. It's consumers. They like the product, it's an image thing, it makes them feel good when they drink it, it fits their image of themselves when they hold it in their hand. It's a whole variety of things that are really hard to capture.""
Beer aside, Constellation Brands is expanding its liquor and wine portfolio as well, adding bourbon brand High West, high-end tequila Casa Noble and Ruffino wine to its mix.
Enjoying a taste of Casa Noble's $1,500-a-bottle Alta Belleza tequila, Sands mused on Constellation's rival, Diageo, purchasing George Clooney's Casamigos tequila brand for $1 billion.
""I thought it was a big price,"" he told Cramer. ""And Casamigos is a hot brand and, you know, it's got Clooney and Rande Gerber and Mike Meldman behind it, so they're good guys. Hey, we wish them all the luck in the world. There's enough room for everybody in this particular category.""
But the message was clear: when it comes to the rest of the categories in alcohol, keep a close eye on Constellation Brands.

 Goldman downgrades beer stocks because millennials like wine better   
 12:44  PM ET Mon, 24 July 2017 |  00:38 
 Goldman Sachs downgraded the Boston Beer Company and Constellation Brands due to sluggish beer sales and shifts in demographic tastes. As it turns out, younger generations are drinking more wine and less beer.
 ""As we explored back in 2014, we expected a cyclical rebound in total alcohol consumption post-recession ,"" wrote chief analyst Freda Zhuo in Monday's note. ""The cause [for shifts in beer and wine market penetration] is younger groups shifting away from beer.""
After the first hour of trade on Monday, shares of Boston Beer were down 5 percent, while shares of Constellation slipped nearly 1 percent.
 Goldman not only suggests that young drinkers aren't consuming as much alcohol as previous generations did, but they also observed that millennials are trading beer for wine and spirits.
""We view the shift in penetration and consumption trends as driven by a shift in preferences in the younger cohorts,"" added Zhuo. ""The youngest demographic (<35 year olds) overall penetration rates are not increasing. The 35-44 year old cohort shows a shift away from Beer to Wine & Spirits.""
Nielsen panel data showed that beer penetration across the United States is 25 percent year to date versus 26 percent in 2016 according to Nielsen panel data. Wine and spirits' penetration was stable at 23 percent and 14 percent respectively.
Neither Boston Beer Company nor Constellation immediately responded to requests for comment. 
Goldman now has a sell rating on Boston Beer Company and a neutral rating on Constellation Brands. Goldman lowered its overall US beer volume forecast to a decline of 0.7 percent in 2017.
 ""Despite the Boston Beer Company's commitment to turn around Sam Adams beer and Angry Orchard cider, we see no improvement in sight and see downside risk to fiscal year 2017 volume guidance."" 
Goldman lowered its 12-month price target for Boston Beer to $110 from $140, representing 20 percent downside from Friday's close. 
Goldman trimmed its price target for Constellation stock to $210 from $212, representing 6 percent upside from Friday's closing bell.
""We remove Constellation from the Americas Conviction List and downgrade to Neutral from Buy, mostly driven by Constellation's price appreciation year-to-date and less upside potential to our price target.""
But wine and spirits are not the only beer substitutes millennials are pursuing. Cowen recently adjusted its rating for Molson Coors, citing increased marijuana usage. 
The report found that during the three most recent cycles of alcohol consumption there was a ""notable inverse correlation with cannabis use."" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer cited how during the 1980s and 1990s alcohol consumption fell 22 percent while marijuana use rose 18 percent.
