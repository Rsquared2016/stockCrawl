Hulu CEO Mike Hopkins
 Hulu was an early attempt by the big networks of Disney (the owner of ABC), Comcast NBCUniversal and Fox to put a foot in the digital direct-to-home space when it was founded back in 2006. (CBS decided to stay out of the consortium.)
 Back then, Netflix was only sending out movies via DVDs in the mail. Hulu launched a website in 2007 to deliver its exclusive network shows and started spending money on ad campaigns with Alec Baldwin.
Hulu was meant as a Big Three network hedge against the growth of ""web video"" and later the streaming threat of Netflix. As time has gone on, Hulu has changed leadership, has considered an IPO, and has considered a sale.
 Ultimately, it has chosen to proceed independently and begin focusing on advertising and a new $40-a-month skinny bundle as its future.
It is one of a handful of over-the-top (OTT) networks with scale and reported over a year ago that it had 12 million subscribers. However, I believe its current 4-part ownership structure remains its greatest challenge to its future growth.
Today, the ownership structure of Hulu is:
 Comcast NBCUniversal with 30% Disney with 30% Fox with 30% Time Warner (soon to be AT&T) in an investment last year with 10%. 
Once the AT&T Time Warner deal closes, Hulu will be 10 percent owned by a company that competes against it with its DirecTV Now skinny bundle offering.
Would Hulu be able to grow more aggressively with a single owner? I think so — and this was also likely the thinking behind a possible sale a few years ago — because:
 There would be less consensus-building leading to compromise decisions. The company could likely be more aggressive about growing internationally, instead of retaining its domestic focus today. The company would likely be faster to decide — correctly — if the skinny bundle approach with ads works or if returning to a focus on paid subscriptions is ideal. Each network probably needs to control its own destiny digitally anyway. It's likely better for all of them to make that switch sooner rather than later. Fox, Disney and Comcast each have their own studios (and TV production) to funnel content to their digital OTT services of the future. Disney and Comcast are already making big investments to prepare to have an independent digital path eventually anyway. Buying out their partners' interests in Hulu would help jump-start that. 
What are the reasons for these networks to keep Hulu's ownership structure as is? A big one is having to absorb losses, which are starting to add up. According to the last Comcast 10-K filing, based on its 30 percent holding, total Hulu losses were $61 million in 2014, $321 million in 2015 and $560 million in 2016. In a world where there is already fear about cord-cutting, anybody buying out their partners for full control of Hulu would have to be prepared to argue that the growth prospects of Hulu far exceed the risk of short-term losses.
In the video-streaming business, even the king, Netflix, isn't showing huge profits. Netflix's net income in the years 2014 to 2016 were $268 million, $123 million and $187 million respectively. That's not exploding profits to match their growth in revenues and subscribers. Amazon is using its OTT losses to drive more Prime memberships in its core business.
What are Hulu's unique advantages today from a content creator's perspective? Beatrice Springborn, Hulu's head of original programming,  recently spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about this and provided this list:
 Hulu is spending as much on original content as Amazon — so presumably $4.5 billion annually; she mentions going from four shows a year to 16 There's a smaller team at the top of Hulu making decisions — 8 execs — which suggests quicker decisions and more accessibility compared with a Netflix. 
Is this really so compelling? There's lots of money sloshing around, with the possibility of others such as Apple entering the fray. Good content will get made somewhere. Now, if Hulu had exclusive first looks at content with people connected to Fox, Disney or NBC Universal, that would be unique.
After last reporting its paid subscribers more than a year ago, Hulu now seems to be focusing on advertising revenues. It recently launched a  complex tier of services at the recent Upfront meetings including:
 Hulu with Live TV — their skinny bundle — for $40 a month, including Hulu content and a skinny bundle of cable content. For $9 extra a month you can add Showtime to the bundle. Hulu's basic streaming service with ads is $7.99 a month. Unlike Tivo, no ads on Hulu are skippable and their technology allows advertisers to update ads on old recorded content you have saved. Without ads, it is $11.99 a month. They have an Enhanced Cloud DVR service for an extra $14.99 a month (200 hours of recording time). Hulu's Unlimited Screens costs another $14.99 a month and lets you have as many simultaneous users as your broadband provider allows plus 3 outside the home concurrently. 
It's possible that Hulu may never report another paid subscriber number, hoping that its skinny bundle instead takes off as their primary revenue source.
With the metrics they are sharing, Hulu is trying to indicate that their slow-and-steady approach is winning. They told advertisers that their hours viewed per subscriber are up 20 percent year-on-year and that their total streams are up 50 percent year-on-year.
But look at  this chart from Mary Meeker. Hulu's share of video traffic over the Internet is up in 2016 from 2012 (it would be a shocker if it weren't), but it is about equal in share today to Xbox One's and still vastly trails Netflix. It's now also behind Amazon Prime, which has probably only accelerated in 2017.
How does Hulu win long-term in a sea of new skinny-bundle offerings? Network TV exclusive windows? All the other skinny bundles will have network TV as an afterthought. More bets on series exclusives like ""The Handmaid's Tale""? It's unclear whether the circumstances which led to them obtaining that strong IP is a repeatable process.
The biggest challenge Hulu faces is that it serves four owners. This critique of Hulu isn't a critique of CEO Mike Hopkins. How do you successfully lead a company without a single strong owner?
The solution to me appears to be that one of the four owners should step up and take control, buying out the others. Disney and Comcast appear to be the most likely candidates. Fox needs to get into digital more but is currently preoccupied with sorting out its news division and completing the Sky deal. And, as mentioned before, AT&T already has DirecTV Now.
With a single owner, Hulu will likely expand internationally more aggressively and better define its content offering and whether it will take a subscription or ad-based approach. There are likely to only be a handful of premium content subscription services and Hulu still has the chance to be one of them — but that window is closing.
Disclosure: Comcast, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, is a co-owner of Hulu.

 Expert: I don't think the idea that cord-cording is accelerating is a surprise   
 2:24  PM ET Fri, 23 June 2017 |  04:00 
 Hulu, not Netflix, appears to be driving the recent increase in cord-cutting, according to Corey Barrett, a senior media analyst at M Science.Cord-cutting, long said to represent the demise of cable companies, is when customers eliminate paid TV from their service provider bundle. Barrett said a recent study from M Science shows the trend is on the rise.""What really stood out to us was that [cord-cutting] was most pronounced among Hulu subscribers,"" Barrett told ""Power Lunch"" on Friday. ""There's a misconception that Netflix is actively driving cord-cutting behavior.""The study found that Netflix subscribers eliminated their cable package at similar rates to the average consumer, while Hulu members saw a higher rate of cord-cutting.The findings also identified Charter Communications as potentially a victim of the practice, ""relative to Comcast,"" according to Barrett.He called the practice ""a generational shift"" and warned disruption could grow in the coming years thanks to more nontraditional firms entering the field.""As a function of that, you have players coming from outside the existing pay-TV ecosystem that are likely much more disruptive to the current ecosystem and drive heavier cord-cutting than what we've seen,"" Barrett said.

4,2017-06-28,A secret to Netflix's success: Social media  ,"Getty Images
Reed Hastings, CEO, Netflix
 There's a secret to Netflix's success: social media.
 The subscription-based video on demand site is more conducive to producing ""viral"" original content, which could give it a sustainable advantage over traditional networks and other on-demand providers such as Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, said Jefferies analyst John Janedis. 
New Netflix original shows generated an average of 30 percent more mentions on Twitter when compared with new shows on network or cable television, he said, recommending investors hold Netflix shares, setting the 12-month price target at $141, a 6.6 percent downside from Tuesday's close price of $153.08.
 ""Management has tied the outperformance of original programming to periods of higher [subscriber] growth, which continues to be the biggest driver for the stock on a quarterly basis,"" Janedis wrote in a note on Wednesday. ""If NFLX's platform is more conducive to producing 'viral' content, this could be a sustainable advantage over traditional media platforms as well as other digital platforms with less scale.""
 Twitter activity can gauge the future success or cancellation of original programming, Janedis said. Following the second season launches of ""The Get Down"" and ""Sense 8,"" two Netflix original series, marked declines in social media activity preceded each show's cancellation.
Netflix releases entire seasons at once, unlike traditional television networks and cable, allowing viewers to binge watch content and help it ""go viral"" through social media messaging.
Recent hit series ""13 Reasons Why"" and ""Narcos"" ""resulted in a surge of social media activity that was sustained for several weeks after the shows premiered,"" wrote Janedis. ""Alternatively, 'Westworld' (HBO) and 'Empire' (FOX), two of the most popular shows on TV, generated Twitter mentions that were more evenly spread throughout a season, tied to the live airing of each episode.""
 Also unlike traditional networks, Netflix is not evaluated on viewership ratings around the launch of content, which may allow new shows a chance to accrue a larger audience. Thus, after a new show premieres, an uptick in social media mentions can ""elevate consumers' perception of the content, and can ultimately drive new subscribers to the platform at a lower cost relative to traditional TV network,"" noted Janedis.
Janedis remains cautious though, as Netflix remains caught in the midst of growing competition for subscribers as Hulu and Amazon continue to invest in their own entertainment platforms.
In a long-awaited announcement, Apple announced earlier this month that Amazon is coming to Apple's TV app and all Apple TVs with Amazon Prime video.
""Our longer term view is unchanged,"" concluded Janedis. ""We continue to believe that emerging competition, elevated programming costs, and cash burn trends are risks that are not fully appreciated in NFLX's valuation.""

6,2017-07-05,"Elon Musk and Reed Hastings both used this ancient mental strategy to grow their billion-dollar businesses  “Fast Money” final trades: V, NFLX, and more  ","On the surface, Tesla and Netflix don't have much in common. One makes cars, solar panels and energy-efficient batteries, and the other streams TV shows and movies.
 But Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings have both used the same ancient decision-making strategy to grow their billion-dollar businesses: ""first principles"" thinking.
The term was coined more than 2,000 years ago by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who believed we learn more by understanding a subject's fundamental principles, those ""things better known and clearer to us,"" according to Terence Irwin's 1989 book ""Aristotle's First Principles.""
 While most of us think through issues based on common knowledge about them, starting over from scratch to get at the root of the problem can help you see it in a new light.  
As Musk explained at a TED conference in 2013: ""We get through life by reasoning by analogy, which essentially means copying what other people do with slight variations. And you have to do that. Otherwise, mentally, you wouldn't be able to get through the day. But when you want to do something new, you have to apply the [first principles] approach.""

 });
 In the latest episode of LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman's podcast, ""Masters of Scale,""  Hoffman interviews Hastings about how he used first principles thinking to scale Netflix from a  DVD-rental mailing service in the late 1990s into one of the world's  most popular streaming services.
Hoffman notes that the decision-making system is popular in Silicon Valley and offers the following definition:
 First principle thinking is the idea that everything you do is underpinned by a foundational belief, or first principles. Instead of blindly following directions or sticking to a process, a first principle thinker will constantly ask, ""What's best for the company?"" and, ""Couldn't we do it this other way instead?"" 
This method allows you to step back and break a problem down into its core parts.
Hastings says creativity and innovation were stifled at the software company he started before Netflix, since they ""were unable to adapt"" due to ""a bunch of people who valued following the process, rather than the first principle thinking.""

 This is how Tesla CEO Elon Musk stays productive   
 7:07  AM ET Mon, 19 June 2017 |  01:01 
 At Netflix, he approached things differently. He knew the advent of broadband internet across the U.S. would pose a challenge to Netflix's DVD-rental business. To avoid leading another company that lacked imagination, he decided to staff Netflix with first principle thinkers and encourage this critical-thinking style.
""We ask people to do what you would think is best for the company,"" Hastings tells Hoffman. ""We don't give them any more guideline than that.""
If this method of reasoning frustrates them, Hastings says, then they probably are not a good match for Netflix.
""It seemed inevitable to [Hastings], that streaming entertainment would eclipse DVDs, just as surely as the combustion engine eclipsed the horse and carriage,"" Hoffman says.
Likewise, in a 2012 interview with Kevin Rose, Musk said that if he hadn't used first principles thinking to advance Tesla technology, he would have been stuck in the horse-and-carriage stage of the transportation revolution.
""You can't say: 'Nobody wants a car because horses are great and we're used to them. They can eat grass [and] there's lots of grass all over the place and there's no gasoline people can buy, so people are never going to get cars.' People did say that, you know,"" Musk said.  
For Musk, first principles thinking means boiling things down to ""the most fundamental truths"" and then reasoning up from there.

 Musk used the cost of batteries as an example. ""People would say, 'Historically it's cost $600 per kilowatt-hour, and so it's not going to be much better than that in the future.' And you say, 'No, what are the batteries made of?' First principles means you say, 'Okay, what are the material constituents of the batteries?'
""You just have to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of a battery cell, and you can have batteries that are much, much cheaper than anyone realizes.""
Although it ""takes a lot more mental energy,"" Musk said this method of thinking has helped him  revolutionize the energy industry.
""Somebody could say, in fact people do, that battery packs are really expensive and that's just the way they'll always be, because that's the way they've been in the past,"" Musk said. ""Well, no, that's pretty dumb, because if you applied that reasoning to anything new, then you would never be able to get to that new thing.""

8,2017-07-10,Netflix CEO Reed Hastings on conquering Europe  ,"Michael Newberg | CNBC
Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix.
 For the co-founder of a company that warns new staff that ""adequate performance"" will result in a ""severance package"", Reed Hastings does not come across as a typical tough guy. Breezy and relaxed, the 56-year-old chief executive of Netflix delivers chilling statements with unnerving warmth.
""We are modelled on sport and if you want to win a championship you have to have an incredible player in every position,"" he explains. ""It's not for everyone. If you want job security you don't go into sports — and you don't join Netflix.""
Even Mr Hastings admits the culture creates ""pockets of fear"". But a decade after he reinvented his DVD rental business as a global online streaming network, it seems to be working.
 Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. 
At the end of April, Netflix broke through the symbolic barrier of 100m members across the world. To celebrate, Mr Hastings posted a picture of himself on Facebook eating a steak alone in a branch of Denny's, the US restaurant chain (he did the same when the company signed up 1m members).
For the first three months of 2017, the company reported revenues of $2.64bn, a 34 per cent increase year on year.
Meanwhile, the entertainment group, best known for big budget hit shows such as House of Cards, Narcos and The Crown, says it will invest $6bn in content this year as it continues its drive to upend traditional TV network programming.
It has been a dizzying ride, but Mr Hastings insists it is just the beginning.
""If you think of any night this last month when you did not watch Netflix what did you do?"" he says.
""Sports, gaming, watching linear TV . . . we compete with all of that. We even compete with sleep. We are just a very small player in the market for time and entertainment.""
The streaming market is becoming crowded, with Amazon vowing to spend $4.5bn on acquiring and commissioning programmes this year, and other rivals such as Hulu, owned by a consortium of US broadcasters including Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox, spending on content and launching a live service in May.
""As long as you do great unique content, there's a market for you,"" Mr Hastings adds.
Having signed up more than 50m households in the US, he wants to grow Netflix in Europe. Appropriately, we meet at the Booking Office, a grand restaurant which looks out on to London's Eurostar terminal at the renovated St Pancras Station. Next stop: dinner in Paris before going on to a celebration with staff in the Netherlands.
Since 2012, Netflix has invested £2bn in original and acquired European content. It recently announced 400 new jobs at its Amsterdam office (Netflix has 3,000 staff globally) and has been launching original shows across the continent, including Las Chicas del Cable — the first original Spanish series — and the Dogs of Berlin, which will be written, produced and shot in Germany.
The European push is timely as the EU considers an overhaul of its rules on video content, dragging technology and streaming groups into the same framework that already exists for traditional broadcasters.
For Netflix this could mean payments to local culture funds in France, for example, and having to meet quotas of locally produced content across the EU, something Mr Hastings seems characteristically relaxed about.
""It's not going to be hard for us to meet those quotas,"" he says, adding that the investment in Europe is ""95 per cent consumer driven"". The other 5 per cent, he adds, is political. ""If we are seen as an outside exploiter we will have problems."" 
Mr Hastings hails from Boston, Massachusetts, but has become one of the biggest names in Hollywood.
His first glimpse of the international power of TV came during his time as a maths teacher in Swaziland 30 years ago.
""While I was travelling around Africa, I saw how people loved television,"" he explains.""You could be in the middle of nowhere but having a TV was a prized possession.""
The journey from itinerant maths graduate to media mogul is unlikely but his enthusiasm for show business is clear. One of his favourite programmes at the moment is 13 Reasons Why, a controversial US high school drama that has been accused by some critics of romanticising suicide. ""We say it's an honest discussion of what's going on in adolescent life,"" he says.
Mr Hastings' first company was a software development business called Pure which he founded in 1991 before selling it six years later. He says the Netflix corporate culture was partly shaped by the mistakes he made as a young tech entrepreneur.
Early success has its problems, he says, when I mention Travis Kalanick, the Uber chief executive who was forced out last month after a series of crises, including accusations of sexism.
""There are a lot of lessons for the young founder experiencing incredible growth,"" he replies, careful not to mention Mr Kalanick by name.
""You are young and a lot of things hit all at once. Those are challenges much like a movie star who gets famous at a young age. Those who make it through like Facebook and Google are fantastic.""
Such praise for Facebook is unsurprising — in addition to running Netflix, Mr Hastings is also a member of the Facebook board, allowing him to see some of the broader political and regulatory challenges facing the disruptive technology groups as they expand beyond the US.
But while Netflix has been grouped together as one of the FAANGs (the big five tech groups that also includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google), Mr Hastings does not see the company as part of Silicon Valley.
Asked to choose between being a tech or an entertainment company, he says: ""If we have to choose, we are more entertainment. But we should aspire to be great at both.""

 Netflix analysis the age-old definition of insanity   
 7:10  PM ET Wed, 12 July 2017 |  01:49 
 After Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter reiterated his sell rating of Netflix on Wednesday, Jim Cramer was glad that he at least acknowledged how wrong he has been on the stock.
 ""But I'm also dismayed that he's sticking by his methodology, the same methodology that caused him and his acolytes to miss almost 100 [basis] points in a stock that, to me, is as obvious as the purloined letter,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""He proudly writes: ""We have consistently valued stocks under our coverage based upon the discounted present value of their future cash flows.' Goodie. That bit of ideology reminds me of that quote everybody attributes to Albert Einstein about the definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results.""
Pachter has been bearish on Netflix for about three years, during which time the stock ran from $63.49 to nearly $160.
 The analyst justified this using traditional metrics like discounted future cash flows, or how much the money Netflix is set to make in the future is worth now.

 Cramer: This Netflix analysis reminds me of the age-old definition of insanity   
 7:11  PM ET Wed, 12 July 2017 |  04:49 
 Cramer argued that Netflix, as a company, should not be valued in the same way as others. The streaming giant trades on content metrics and subscriber growth, two very specific and difficult-to-calculate pieces of data.
""You see, at a certain point, the prism you're using is just wrong, and you've got to to scramble. You have to adapt. You've got to find a new one,"" Cramer said. ""I don't mean to pick on Pachter, although I think 'Pick on Pachter' would be a great name for a sit-com, but periodically, there are stocks that defy the traditional metrics and you've just got to scrap those metrics if you want to understand the stock.""
In his analysis, Pachter writes that an increase in show cancellations and poor execution of expensive originals could pose threats to Netflix's hefty $6 billion content budget for 2017.
While cancellations could set Netflix back, especially since its budget far outpaces what its competitors plan to spend this year, Cramer said that more content naturally results in more cancellations.
""Given all the original content Netflix puts out, the failures are somewhat inevitable, and if anything, they'll have to increase. That's the law of large content,"" Cramer said. ""Still, the record is darned good, much better than everyone else, and that matters, especially when worldwide numbers are at stake and some content plays extraordinarily well overseas.""
Along with the stocks of Amazon and Tesla, Netflix's big picture cannot be captured by using traditional methods of valuing stocks, which is where Pachter went wrong, Cramer said.
""Knowing the right metric has always been the key to picking good stocks,"" Cramer said. ""Wedbush has clearly picked the wrong metric. And sometimes, that's all that matters.""
In an email to CNBC, Pachter responded to Cramer's analysis:
""Jim is absolutely right that my Sell rating is based on the wrong metrics,"" the analyst wrote. ""Investors care about subscriber additions, and as long as they continue to care about subscriber additions and those metrics rise, the stock will continue to work.""
Pachter noted that having covered the stock of Netflix for 13 years, he has only miscalculated  the number of subscriber additions for two out of 52 quarters.
""I am not so arrogant (or foolish) as to believe that investors care what my rating or price target is; rather, they care about my view on the metrics that matter, and as stated above, I have nailed subscriber additions correctly 95% of the time. If that's the metric that matters, I've done my job,"" Pachter wrote.
Pachter went on to write that as a sell-side analyst for Wedbush, it is his job to issue price targets and ratings on stocks for investors.
""In the upcoming quarter (Q2, reporting Monday after the close), my call is that they are going to crush both domestic and international subscriber net additions,"" Pachter said in the email. ""That's all investors care about. ... I talk about Netflix a lot (literally every day) to investors, and have consistently said that so long as people care about subscriber additions, the company will deliver and the stock should be owned.""
Where Pachter disagreed with Cramer was on using subscriber additions as a solid metric for estimating future cash flows. The analyst argued that while more subscribers will likely lead to revenue growth, it will not lead to strong operating leverage for Netflix.
Pachter wrote that this will be true as long as most of the content watched on Netflix is owned by third parties. He pointed out that Netflix does not own most of its branded ""originals"" like ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black,"" its two top shows.
""Investors have bought into the fiction that they own every 'original', yet they own fewer than 20% of them. In order to be compared favorably to HBO (which is worth around 20% of what Netflix is worth), they need a lot more success with OWNED originals,"" Pachter wrote. ""That's the basis for my cash flow argument, and I don't really care how many subscribers they add, they are not even remotely close to making real profits.""

 In a Facebook video published in May that has since garnered 1.3 million views and been circulated through various media outlets, including the Australian news site news.com.au, the self-made millionaire doesn't offer sympathy for young people who haven't yet made it.
As he puts it, ""You can live on six hours sleep, so you have 18 hours. You have 18 g------ hours. I want to know what you're doing with your 18 hours.""
 Even if you're working a 9-to-5 job, commuting for an hour and spending some time each day with your family, that still leaves you at least five hours to hustle, Vaynerchuk says.

 Gary Vaynerchuk: 'Insecurity is a killer' and here's how to beat it   
 12:29  PM ET Mon, 13 March 2017 |  01:03 
 Vaynerchuk goes on to say that if you want to waste valuable time watching TV, or even ""by getting rest,"" you need to accept the fact that you'll never be rich or successful. You're ""giving up opportunity to go into a new world,"" he says.
""Let's call it what it is,"" says Vaynerchuk. ""You want to live as well as the 1 to 2 percent in the world. It's not very complicated. The math is very raw. If you want to have one of the best lives in the world, which is you live on your terms, you have to pay your dues to get there.""
The advice has sparked intense debate online. Many viewers questioned if it was healthy to pare down your sleep to just six hours.
""YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN'T live on six hours a day; you'll be in a constant state of lacking sleep and end up being much less productive. It also increases your chances of accidents and sickness,"" one commenter writes.
""You can't live on six hours of sleep. Period,"" another commenter says. ""Also, how are we giving up opportunity to be a part of 1 percent because we get rest? Money and love doesn't come with hard work; it comes with doing what you love, what you have passion for.""

 Self-made millionaire: Working too hard is not the cause of burnout   
 10:53  AM ET Thu, 23 Feb 2017 |  01:11 
 Other detractors have pointed out Vaynerchuk's first successful venture stemmed from expanding his family's already thriving wine shop. He built an online presence for the store with the launch of WineLibrary.com in 1997 and grew revenue from $3 million a year to $45 million in less than a decade, Fortune reports. But he didn't start from scratch.
""Love to get 'stop whining' advice from [does 5 seconds of research] the guy who was handed a $3 million business by his dad,"" Twitter user Burgerdrome said in a tweet that garnered 5,300 retweets and nearly 13,000 favorites.
 TWEET
 The entrepreneur responded to the criticism by acknowledging in a follow-up comment that sleep needs vary. News.com.au reports that Vaynerchuk ""apologized 'if the tone was lost.' 'I'm thrilled if people sleep nine hours a day,' he wrote. 'It's what you do when you're awake!'""
Other self-made millionaires have offered less colorful versions of the same advice. Grant Cardone, for example, says what distinguishes him is how much he works: ""Most people work 9-to-5. I work 95 hours [per week]. If you ever want to be a millionaire, you need to stop doing the 9-to-5 and start doing 95."" That comes out to about 14 working hours a day.
""If you can outwork the rest of the population, you're going to get lucky,"" Cardone tells CNBC.
Plenty of commenters applaud Vaynerchuk for his tough-love style, saying that his point is not really about the number of hours you sleep but what you do when you're awake. You should use every minute you have, they argue. 
Overall, the detractors, though vocal, seem to be a minority. ""Why are there so many negative people on this thread?"" one commenter says. ""His message is simple. If you want to have a certain lifestyle, then put in the time and effort to achieve it. Don't complain about not having enough if you don't utilize your time wisely.""

 Netflix shares jump after earnings beat on top line   
 4:29  PM ET Mon, 17 July 2017 |  02:10 
 Netflix said that it added 5.2 million total memberships, blowing away Wall Street's estimates of 3.23 million during a historically weak quarter amid the return of marquee content like ""Orange is the New Black."" 
 The company revealed this growth during its second-quarter earnings report on Monday. It fell just shy of analyst estimates on EPS, and beat on revenue.
Shares popped more than 10 percent after hours, trading above the all-time intraday high of $166.87 a share.
 Mark Neuling | CNBC 
Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix.
 Results vs. expectations
 EPS: 15 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share, adjusted, expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Revenue: $2.79 billion vs. $2.76 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate User growth (net adds): 5.2 million (1.07 million domestic, 4.14 million international) vs. 3.23 million total streaming (631,000 domestic, 2.59 million international) expected by a FactSet estimate. 
That's compared with earnings of 9 cents per share on revenue of $2.11 billion in the year-ago period.
 Q3 guidance, EPS: 32 cents vs. 23 cents per share expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Q3 guidance, revenue: $2.97 billion vs. $2.87 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Q3 guidance, net adds: 4.4 million vs. 3.925 million total streaming expected by Street Account 
 User growth key amid mounting competition
 Since Netflix's last earnings report, new seasons of popular series ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" hit the small screen. ""13 Reasons Why"" also garnered buzz after it was unveiled on the last day of the first quarter.
Netflix's financial report comes on the heels of the 2017  Emmy nominations, which recognized Netflix series such as ""Master of None,"" ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" and ""Stranger Things"" in the company's 91 nominations.
But the nominations also highlighted the mounting competition in the digital streaming space, as Amazon ramps up content spending, and Apple dips its toe into original content with shows like ""Planet of the Apps."" Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has told CNBC that Amazon is an ""awfully scary"" foe.

 Last quarter, Netflix said it would spend over $1 billion in 2017 on marketing costs alone, projecting that the company would have negative free cash flow for ""many years"" as it invests in original content. On Monday, the company noted it expects $2 billion to $2.5 billion of negative free cash flow this year, a steeper shortfall than the $2 billion in negative free cash flow forecast last quarter.
There was no mention of net neutrality protections in the earnings results release, despite a vocal outcry from the technology sector as a whole this month. Hastings has said that net neutrality is no longer a battle that Netflix is especially vulnerable to.
Netflix has shuffled some top executives in recent months, adding chief product officer Greg Peters and feature film boss Scott Stuber. Netflix announced an ambitious plan for its feature film business on Monday, including the release of 40 features ""that range from big budget popcorn films to grassroots independent cinema.""
The entertainment technology company also continued its international expansion, where it gets the bulk of its user growth, by adding support for more languages, and content such as ""Las Chicas del Cable."" 
Netflix acknowledged the increasing demands on viewers' attention, noting that ""creating a TV network is now as easy as creating an app, and investment is pouring into content production around the world."" 
""It seems our growth just expands the market,"" the company said in a statement. ""The largely exclusive nature of each service's content means that we are not direct substitutes for each other, but rather complements.""

 Cable loses subscribers to Netflix as consumers opt for 'a la carte': Gerber Kawasaki's Ross Gerber   
 6:48  PM ET Mon, 17 July 2017 |  04:55 
 Netflix may have a challenge keeping the attention of its audience as more rivals release their own original content.
 According to data measurement firm Verto Analytics, people are watching Netflix less even as subscriber numbers grow.  Average viewing time decreased 13 percent over the last quarter alone — 179 minutes per month in June compared to 206 minutes in March. 
Though the data fluctuates month to month, there is an overall decline over the last year. In July 2016, Netflix viewers spent an average of 268 minutes on the platform, and last December it was still at 222 minutes. Verto's data comes from 20,000 of its SmartPanel users, which have installed on-device measurement apps on their phones, tablets and computers.
 Still, Netflix is going strong. The company added 5.2 million subscribers, according to its Q2 earnings report on Monday, far above estimates of 3.2 million. (It also posted $2.79 billion in revenue, and earnings per share of 15 cents.)
 Netflix's decline in viewership time could be due to the fact that newer users may not watch as much video as its early-adopter subscribers, Verto Analytics CEO Hannu Verkasalo told CNBC by email.
""As Netflix grows bigger, it is also gaining mass market consumers into their user base, which decreases average engagement metrics,"" he wrote.
The shorter sessions could also mean more subscribers are moving to mobile screens, which traditionally have shorter viewing times. Netflix is now competing against Facebook, Snapchat and YouTube, as they develop more robust video programming, Verkasalo added.
""Netflix is going more and more towards the short-form competition and mobile competition,"" he wrote.
And as other companies release their over-the-top TV viewing options and premium original video offerings, Netflix is facing stiffer competition. Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, Sony PlayStation Vue, AT&T's DirecTV, and Dish's Sling TV all offer ways to watch TV without a cable or satellite subscription. Meanwhile, others, such as Apple and Amazon, are ramping up original content.
Still, the company remains the leader in viewership time. For comparison, viewers spent 102.8 minutes on Amazon Video and 67 minutes on HBO Go in June, according to Verto Analytics data. It still has 4 times the monthly users as Amazon, and 28 times the number of subscribers as HBO Go, per the company's analytics.
Netflix declined to comment. 
Note: CNBC's parent company NBCUniversal is a co-owner of Hulu.

 Netflix shares are surging Tuesday as Wall Street proclaimed the company's utter dominance of the internet video streaming market after it crushed subscriber expectations.The company added 5.2 million memberships during the second quarter compared with the Wall Street consensus of 3.2 million driven by international subscriber growth.As Netflix has a ""growing distribution ecosystem and expanding addressable base, we believe that Netflix remains on track in building out an unmatched global entertainment platform,"" Goldman's Heath Terry wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.The streaming giant is one of the market's best-performing names as its shares have rallied more than 30 percent this year through Monday versus the S&P 500's 10 percent return. Netflix shares opened up 9 percent Tuesday morning to a new all-time high. ""We continue to recommend owning NFLX. The company's global scale and ability to mass-personalize content and marketing is fueling subscriber growth that few competitors are positioned to match,"" KeyBanc Capital's Andy Hargreaves wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""This should fuel revenue and subscriber growth at least in line with expectations while expanding barriers to entry.""Analysts emphasized the importance of Netflix's high-quality original content such as ""Orange is the New Black,"" ""13 Reasons Why"" and ""House of Cards"" which sparked the positive results.""We believe the rapidly growing content offering, led by originals that in aggregate garnered 91 Emmy nominations last week, drove the stronger new sign-ups in 2Q,"" Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""Netflix's growing exclusive original content slate has somewhat of a multiplier effect on growth, as content distributors around the world continue to go through an evolution in their approach to Netflix."" Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating for Netflix and raised its price target on the shares to $210 from $185. Goldman Sachs also reaffirmed its buy rating and increased its price forecast to $200 from $175. Netflix shares closed at $161.70 on Monday.Netflix noted how the second quarter broke two important records for the company. ""We also crossed the symbolic milestones of 100 million members and more international than domestic members. It was a good quarter,"" Netflix wrote its shareholder letter for the second quarter.

Reed Hastings, chief executive officer of Netflix
 Netflix shares surged by nearly 10 percent at the open of trading after posting much better-than-expected subscriber numbers Monday evening. But don't worry if you missed this move, it's not too late to get in on the party, history shows. 
 Since 2002, of the 17 times earnings pushed shares of Netflix up by 10 percent or more at the open of trading the next day, the stock continued higher from the open to close in 14 of those instances, Bespoke Investment Group tweeted on Tuesday.
 @Bespokeinvest tweet.
 One reason for the rally as trading continues throughout the day may be the bull calls from Wall Street that come flowing in. For example, Bank of America Merrill Lynch released a note to investors on Tuesday making the case for a 70 percent further surge in the price to $300.

 The results of Netflix's latest quarter show why it's a behemoth stock, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday.
 ""You know you don't to get to be FANG for nothing,"" he said on ""Squawk on the Street.""
Cramer spoke a day after the stock of the video-on-demand service surged in after-hours trading following its second-quarter earnings release where it reported 5.2 million additional memberships, 2 million more than Wall Street expected.
 It reported revenue came in at $2.79 billion versus a $2.76 billion consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.
Shares of Netflix were at all-time highs Tuesday. The streaming giant is one of the market's best-performing names as it has rallied more than 30 percent this year through Monday.
""Facebook figured out you use the internet to be able to tell personal narratives. Amazon figured out you use the internet to sell merchandise. Google figured out the internet to be able to do YouTube short form. These guys figured out the internet by being able to produce content that is loved in Korea and loved in Brazil and loved in Europe,"" Cramer said.
""This is [an] intellectual opioid,"" he said.
Regarding Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Cramer said he was uplifted by Hastings' conference call and found it to be a ""joyous"" experience.

Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch just laid out a bullish case for Netflix, saying it could rise to $300 a share.
 In a note to investors on Tuesday, BofAML reiterated a buy rating on Netflix and raised its price objective to $199 from $184.
Shares were trading 9.3 percent higher to $176 in Tuesday's premarket. A move to $300 would represent a 70.5 percent gain from the premarket price.
 The Bank of America Merrill Lynch's note was the most bullish on Netflix on Tuesday. On Monday, the streaming video company announced that 5.2 million subscribers had been added in the second quarter, 2 million more than analysts forecasted.
To hit the $300 per share mark, Netflix would need to post faster pricing growth of 7 percent per year versus its current models for 5 percent, while also rapidly increasing subscribers to 250 million internationally, the bank said.
""Pricing is a big driver as sub gains take more time to achieve offsetting valuation gains, but price changes are immediate rev. and margin lift,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Nat Schindler said in the note.
""We note that NFLX stated it expects ""mid-single digit ARPU growth for the foreseeable future"" and recently increased prices in Australia. We think further price increases in international markets could represent upside to our model and support our bull case scenario."" 
The note follows Netflix's Q2 earnings, which hit after the bell on Monday. 
Revenue came in at $2.79 billion versus $2.76 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. Netflix predicts revenue of $2.97 billion in the third quarter vs. $2.87 billion expected by Wall Street. Earnings per share in the second quarter were 15 cents, a penny short of expectations.

 Netflix shares soar on big jump in subscriber numbers   
 6:51  AM ET Tue, 18 July 2017 |  02:53 
 Netflix's subscriber growth in the United States is nearly saturated, but the streaming company has great potential for international growth, internet analyst Anthony DiClemente told CNBC on Tuesday.
 A day after Netflix reported it added 5.2 million total memberships in the second quarter, its shares were up more than 9 percent in premarket, trading at $176.99 per share. DiClemente says Netflix could go to $195 per share.
Netflix's new memberships totaled 2 million more than analysts had forecast for the second quarter. The company has 104 million subscribers worldwide.
 ""In this country, I would say we're getting closer to saturation, roughly 52 million subscribers. The company has talked about the market being 60 to 90,"" the internet analyst at Instinet Senior Media said on ""Squawk Box.""
""I would argue that the revenue growth is stronger than the subscriber potential with pricing power that we see globally,"" he said.
Netflix faces mounting competition from companies like Amazon and Apple.
DiClemente says internationally, Netflix could just be scratching the surface on subscribers, penetrating less than 10 percent of that market.
In its earning statement Monday, the video-on-demand company reported that second-quarter revenue came in at $2.79 billion versus $2.76 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. It predicts revenue of $2.97 billion in the third quarter vs. $2.87 billion expected by Wall Street. Earnings per share in the second quarter were 15 cents, a penny short of expectations.

 Cramer: The key to Netflix's success   
 6:56  PM ET Tue, 18 July 2017 |  00:59 
 In light of Netflix's strong earnings report, Jim Cramer knows CEO Reed Hastings understands three things: content can be king, people love bargains, and bigwig money managers will invest in internet stocks with promise.
 ""Netflix is, to the naked eye, a two-pronged success. If your company can produce local content that people love worldwide and you only charge them $8 or €8 a month, you'll land and expand. You'll grow and grow and grow,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
But the third element, the willingness of Wall Street financiers to catch and pay for the next hot internet-related trend, was what really drove Hastings' success so far, Cramer said.
 By using technology to deliver popular programming, Netflix was able to capture investors' attention (and wallets) despite losing swaths of money on production expenses.
""As Reed says, 'Negative free cash flow will be an indicator of enormous success,'"" Cramer said. ""In other words, Netflix is an entertainment company but is being valued as a tech company, as money managers believe it's all well and good to lose money now if you're going to dominate later.""
After listening to Netflix's post-earnings conference call, Cramer touted the company's simple, cutthroat model. Once the streaming giant figured out the content people liked, it offered them a bargain on the cost of content, hence the negative cash flow.
Not only was the $8-per-month price enticing, but Cramer said it helped Netflix fend off rivals, as any company that tries to compete with that cost will end up erasing its own gross margins.
Then, Netflix incorporated artificial intelligence to keep its audience hooked by analyzing user data and offering recommendations based on customers' watching activity.
""Last night's extraordinary quarter was a triumph of science masquerading as art,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
The science came from Netflix using the stock market as a source of capital so that it can continue losing money on its huge amount of content while keeping costs low, Cramer said, adding that if Netflix wanted to turn a profit, it could simply cut back on content or raise costs.
""It's the same model as Amazon. Money managers backed Amazon because they knew, at a certain point, if they wanted to, they could raise the price of Prime offerings to make more money,"" he said. ""The more Netflix knows about what people love, what you love, the more it can scale that love into not profits — as so many thought were needed — but subscribers. And by that metric, do you know that the stock of Netflix remains undervalued? Which is why, even after this run, it is still not too late to buy Netflix.""

 Earnings season is among the most volatile times for short-term traders, and this one will be no exception, with many cult stocks expected by the options market to have double-digit percentage swings in any direction. Netflix shares surged Tuesday after the streaming company reported better-than-expected subscriber gains. The strategist recommended investors buy call options on Monday before the company's earnings announcement. ""Netflix Inc.'s almost 13% jump (vs. NASDAQ up 0.5%) following 2Q earnings Monday night is a reminder that even as internet bellwethers have achieved significant scale they remain volatile around events,"" Strugger wrote in the note to clients Wednesday.Here is the specific Facebook options trade the strategist recommends to maximize your returns.

 The case for buying stock in innovative FANG companies   
 6:31  PM ET Thu, 20 July 2017 |  01:01 
 Some investors wonder how the FANG stocks, Jim Cramer's acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet, can go higher without good news driving their runs.
 ""Is their recent rally just the greater fool theory writ large, where you buy them today, confident that someone will pay even more for them tomorrow simply because they've got momentum?"" the ""Mad Money"" host asked. ""In this particular case, I think the answer is an emphatic no. The truth is that these companies are constantly innovating, always giving you new earnings-additive reasons to buy their stocks.""
Cramer pointed to Thursday morning's news that Facebook would launch a subscription-based news service, working with various media outlets to aggregate content for its users.
 On top of that, the company is also starting to revamp its video advertising capabilities, and a recent analyst report showed Facebook's Instagram outpacing rival Snap at every turn.
""These are all new earnings per share boosters that give you more reason to buy the darned stock,"" Cramer said.
Amazon also had news to share on Thursday when it announced a deal with struggling retailer Sears to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com and integrate Kenmore Smart appliance with Amazon Alexa.
""Sears, its pathetic partner, doesn't have that much left, but it does have one of the best brand names in appliances. They haven't savaged that. Kenmore's still good. You put Kenmore together with Amazon, you throw in Alexa so you can scream at your washing machine all you want to turn on, and voila, you're off to the races,"" Cramer said.
Fresh off of an unexpectedly strong earnings beat, Netflix created buzz and likely boosted international subscriber numbers with its recently released film ""Okja,"" a star-studded picture by famed South Korean director Bong Joon-ho about a giant, genetically engineered pig.
""Okja was Netflix's final release of the second quarter and I think it's the film that put international sign-ups over the top of domestics,"" Cramer said. ""Right story, right publicity, fabulous knowledge of South Korean culture, all things that the conventional studios reject or just don't even know how to do.""
Alphabet's Google also announced the roll-out of a new function on Wednesday that will personalize its mobile news feed to ""keep you in the know even when you're not searching"" and provide more ""bite-size answers"" to users' searches, according to a Google search executive.
""Now, I'm not saying these stocks can't go down — Alphabet and Netflix both declined [Thursday],"" Cramer said. ""I'm saying that they just keep making news, generating actual events and products that are indeed additive to earnings. Raising-numbers FANG. As long as that continues to happen, these stocks can continue to go higher, and you shouldn't feel foolish for pulling the trigger because they seem to introduce needle movers every single day of the week.""

19,2017-07-27,A company owned by Bill Gates is placing companies' products in Netflix and Amazon shows  ,"Paul Morigi | Getty Images
Kevin Spacey speaks on stage at the portrait unveiling and season 4 premiere of Netflix's 'House Of Cards' at the National Portrait Gallery.
 Netflix and Amazon shows may not have commercials, but that doesn't mean they don't have advertising.
 Almost all Amazon shows have at least one product placement, and about 74 percent of Netflix do, said Greg Isaacs, chief product and marketing officer at integration company Branded Entertainment Network (BEN).
BEN, which is owned by Bill Gates, places products in TV shows, streaming content and in digital influencer videos. The company, which used to be part of Corbis, did over 6,000 placements last year, including getting Dunkin' Donuts and GM in ""House of Cards,"" Tincup Whiskey in ""Jessica Jones"" and Jose Cuervo in ""Fuller House."" 
 BEN isn't the only company doing this on the biggest online film and TV platforms. Panarea Film Productions and  Brand-Aide Entertainment teamed up to get Anheuser-Busch InBev products in ""House of Cards,"" Advertising Age reported.
Getting your company in a Netflix or Amazon show costs between $50,000 to $500,000 per episode, said Isaacs.
The price is determined by how long the product is in the episode and the popularity of the show, with ""House of Cards"" attracting top dollar. How the product is used – for example, a logo in the background versus an actual plot point in the story – can change the price. 
 Courtesy of BEN
Dunkin Donuts paid for its logo to be in Netflix's ""House of Cards.""
 Though shows have to legally clear with a brand if they are going to use their logo or product in an episode, they don't necessarily have to charge a fee. However, since there are no commercial opportunities on these popular streaming platforms, product integration is a way to sneak in ads. 
Certain genres, like fantasy or period pieces, don't lend themselves to product placement. For example: Amazon's alternative history series ""The Man in the High Castle"" didn't have any integrations, nor did Netflix's talk show-style ""Bill Nye Saves the World,"" according to BEN's analysis. 
Not all the money goes to Netflix or Amazon, and the fees usually go to the production company. In the case of ""House of Cards,"" Media Rights Capital is the production company while Netflix is just a digital distributor. ""Transparent"" on the other hand, is produced by Amazon Studios.

 A government crackdown on Amazon is 'inevitable,' says Rich Barton   
 5:51  PM ET Wed,  2 Aug 2017 |  00:51 
 Technology entrepreneur Rich Barton says government intervention on Amazon in the future is unavoidable.
 Barton was asked about his views on Amazon in relation to the Department of Justice's antitrust investigation of Microsoft during the 1990s in a Bloomberg podcast interview.""I lived through that DOJ thing. It was really rough. It's no fun. And I think it is inevitable as companies get really, really huge,"" Barton said in the podcast interview published Friday.
""I think Jeff [Bezos] is probably well aware of that,"" Barton said. Bezos ""is trying to do everything he can to delay that as long as possible and to play within the rules, but eventually the tall poppy gets chopped in.""Barton has served on Netflix's board of directors since 2002. He is one of the few businessmen who have started multiple billion-dollar companies. He founded Expedia in 1994, co-founded Zillow in 2005 and worked as a product manager at Microsoft in the early 1990s. Currently, Barton is a venture partner at Benchmark Capital.Expedia and Zillow have market values of $23 billion and $8 billion respectively, according to FactSet.The entrepreneur also predicted Amazon will likely dominate the software business going forward:
 ""They are really the major force in enterprise software as well now. Because of AWS [Amazon Web Services] and because pretty much most computing is moving into the cloud … The whole enterprise software stack is moving out of these premise based systems as sold by Oracle, Microsoft, IBM [while] Amazon keeps adding more and more functionality embedded as a service within the cloud and is taking over chunk by chunk ... these enterprise software categories."" 
Last week Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin hinted the administration may soon take ""a position"" on Amazon's tax collection policy after President Donald Trump repeatedly blasted the company on the topic on Twitter.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. See the full Bloomberg podcast interview here.

 3 stocks that defy 'doing your homework'   
 7:26  PM ET Mon,  7 Aug 2017 |  01:03 
 When Jim Cramer was new to the stock business, he read legendary fund manager Peter Lynch's 1989 book, ""One Up On Wall Street: How to Use What You Already Know to Make Money in the Market.""
 The book revolved around a key piece of advice: if investors kept their eyes open to products or experiences they liked, they would have an easier time finding profitable investments.
Lynch wrote that enjoying companies' offerings should lead investors to research those companies and make informed decisions about whether to buy their stocks.
 ""But a funny thing happened since Lynch penned his seminal work,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The homework has, in some cases, actually kept you out of stocks that you might otherwise have owned and made fortunes in.""
In recent years, companies like Amazon, Netflix and Tesla have passed Lynch's first test, selling beloved products, while undeniably failing the second, having solid, stable financials.
Amazon, for one, was considered to be overvalued for years. The e-commerce giant made little to no money, relying on financial markets for funds because investors believed in the company.
""But the love for the product and the genius of the man behind it, [founder and CEO] Jeff Bezos, drove the stock to where it is today, one of the greatest runs of all time,"" Cramer said.
Cramer argued that Netflix's rise was no different. If investors had done their homework on the streaming service, they would have seen that it was a money-losing machine.
""Making things even more difficult, on the recent conference call, CEO Reed Hastings actually championed the notion that negative free cash flow, something I don't like, 'will be an indicator of enormous success,'"" Cramer said. ""I just don't think that would pass the Lynch test.""
Given that Netflix expects to see between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in negative free cash flow, or capital spending that costs more than the company's operating cash flow, this year, the company seems to be on the right track, at least according to Hastings.
Perhaps the most pointed exception to Lynch's investing rule is Tesla. On Monday, the automaker announced plans to raise $1.5 billion in a U.S. bond offering to fund its growth.
The offering comes as Tesla scales up production of its Model 3 sedan, a product already in high demand and beloved by consumers. Cramer said that aces the first part of the ""Lynch test.""
""But the second part? Whoa! It's almost impossible to tell how much money Tesla makes per car, if anything. Nor is it possible to define the future of the company,"" Cramer said. ""If everything goes right it could be the next Amazon, a tech company that sells cars, just as Amazon's a tech company that's in retail. If it doesn't, then the stock could flame out.""
All in all, homework is valuable, but it can sometimes keep investors from chasing some of the market's most lucrative stocks, a mistake Cramer has made himself, he admitted.
""I wish I had an answer for this conundrum. Maybe you just take some real 'Mad Money' and buy one of them: preferably Netflix or Amazon because they're far more proven than Tesla,"" Cramer said. ""No matter. The fact is that some stories flunk the near-term fundamentals even as they triumph over the long term. ... Two of these three have already done so. For all I can tell, the third will, too.""

Bob Iger
 Disney CEO Bob Iger spoke to CNBC's Julia Boorstin about the company's earnings report on Tuesday, and discussed the company's plans to withdraw its movies from Netflix. Here's a full transcript.
 JULIA BOORSTIN: WITH THIS BIG NEWS TODAY ABOUT YOUR BIG INVESTMENT IN BAMTECH AND THESE TWO NEW STREAMING SERVICES IN THE WORKS. WHY DID IT MAKE SENSE -- YOU ALREADY OWNED A MINORITY STAKE IN BAMTECH -- WHY DID IT MAKE SENSE TO BUY A MAJORITY STAKE?
BOB IGER: WELL THIS REPRESENTS A BIG STRATEGIC SHIFT FOR THE COMPANY. AND WE FELT THAT HAVING CONTROL OF THE PLATFORM – THAT WE'VE BEEN VERY IMPRESSED WITH SINCE WE BOUGHT THE 33% SHARE A YEAR AGO – WOULD GIVE US CONTROL OF OUR OWN DESTINIY, OR MORE ABILITY TO BASICALLY SHAPE THE SERVICES THAT WE JUST DESCRIBED.
 BOORSTIN: AND IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO ALMOST TO THE DAY THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RISE OF CORD-CUTTING AND HOW THAT WAS STARTING TO REALLY IMPACT ESPN AND THE IMPACT YOU SAW GOING FORWARD. HOW MUCH IS ALL OF THIS ABOUT THE RISE OF CORD-CUT AND YOU NEEDING TO MAKE BIG CHANGES TO CHANGE THE FUTURE OF ESPN?
IGER: WELL, THIS MOVE CAPITALIZES ON A FEW TRENDS THAT WE'VE SEEN. ON THE SPORTS SIDE, FIRST OF ALL, LIVE SPORTS CONTINUE TO BE VERY, VERY POPULAR. 94 OUT OF THE TOP 100 TV SHOWS IN 2016 IN THE UNITED STATES WERE SPORTING EVENTS, FOR INSTANCE.
SECONDLY, THE ESPN BRAND IS STILL VERY STRONG AND, THIRD, WE HAVE SEEN A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN APP-BASED MEDIA CONSUMPTION ON SERVICES THAT ARE OVER THE TOP OR DIRECT TO CONSUMER SERVICES. SO WE FELT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR US TO TAKE A BIGGER STEP IN THAT DIRECTION TO OFFER ESPN-BRANDED LIVE SPORTS ON A SERVICE THAT WE CONTROL, THAT CAN BE BOUGHT OVER THE TOP AND SOLD DIRECT TO CONSUMER ON A PLATFORM, THE BAMTECH PLATFORM, THAT HAS REALLY IMPRESSED US IN TERMS OF ITS LIVE STREAMING CAPABILITY, ITS ABILITY TO MANAGE CUSTOMER SERVICES ON BASICALLY A SOUP-TO-NUTS BASIS, MEANING FROM REGISTRATION AND CUSTOMER ACQUISITION TO CUSTOMER ATTENTION AND CREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT. AND THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY STRONG AD TECH SERVICE AND AN ABILITY TO MINE USER DATA, SO THIS IS A VERY ROBUST PLATFORM, PERFECT FOR WHAT WE WANT TO DO WITH IT FOR ESPN.
BOORSTIN: SO TELL US ABOUT WHAT THE ESPN SERVICES IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE YOU SAY IT'S LAUNCHING IN THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT YEAR. HOW MUCH ARE YOU GOING TO CHARGE FOR IT, AND WHAT CAN YOU ACCESS IF IT DOESN'T INCLUDE WHAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE ON ESPN?
IGER: WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE WILL BE ONE APP. WE HAVE THE CONSUMER IN MIND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE WE WANT TO DELIVER, SO THERE WILL BE ONE ESPN APP AND AN ESPN OR A SPORTS ENTHUSIAST CAN USE THE ESPN APP AS THEY HAVE BEEN USING IT TO ACCESS SCORES AND HIGHLIGHTS AND OTHER SPORTS INFORMATION. IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO YOU AUTHENTIC THEIR SUBSCRIPTION TO MULTI-CHANNEL PROVIDERS SO THEY CAN WATCH THE LINEAR ESPN NETWORKS ON IT. IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ACCESS TO SOME 10,000 ADDITIONAL LIVE SPORTING EVENTS JUST IN THE FIRST YEAR, THEN THEY CAN BUY THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WHICH IS A COMPLEMENTARY OR AN ADDITIVE SERVICE TO THE ESPN CHANNELS THROUGH THE SAME APP, SO IT'S A ONE-STOP SHOPPING, ONE-STOP EXPERIENCE FOR THE CONSUMER. AGAIN, ALL ESPN-BRANDED.
BOORSTIN: AND WHO DO CAN YOU SAY THIS NEW SERVICE IS TARGETING. IS IT TARGETING CORD-CUTTERS?
IGER: IT'S TARGETING SPORTS ENTHUSIASTS AND FANS OF ESPN.
BOORSTIN: AND SO JUST TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF HOW THIS WILL FIT IN WITH YOUR OVERALL STRATEGY – IS THERE HAD A WORLD IN WHICH YOU WOULD BREAK YOUR REGULAR ESPN SERVICE OUT FROM THE BUNDLE AND OFFER DIRECT TO CONSUMER THROUGH THIS?
IGER: WELL FOR NOW THE MODEL OF THE MULTI-CHANNEL ECOSYSTEM – ONE THAT ESPN HAS OBVIOUSLY DISTRIBUTED SERVICES ON FROM THE BEGINNING, IS STILL VERY ROBUST IN TERMS OF ITS PROFITABILITY TO THE COMPANY AND TO ESPN. SO WE DON'T HAVE RIGHT NOW A NEED TO NECESSARILY BREAK IT OUT FROM THAT, BUT THIS CERTAINLY GIVES US THE OPTIONALITY IF WE GET TO A POINT WHERE THAT BUSINESS MODEL IS NO LONGER SERVING THE NEEDS OR THE INTEREST OF THE COMPANY AND THE SHAREHOLDERS AND ESPN. THIS GIVES US THE ABILITY TO GO DIRECT WITH WHAT IS THE ESPN LINEAR SERVICE, BUT THIS IS NOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT IN THAT DIRECTION RIGHT NOW. THE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND THE USER INTERFACE THAT WE; RE BUYING AND THAT WELL CONTINUE TO MANAGE CERTAINLY GIVES US THAT ABILITY THOUGH.
BOORSTIN: BUT YOU DID SEE WHAT WAS IT, AS 23% DECLINE OPERATING INCOME IN YOUR CABLE NETWORK, WHICH WAS DRIVEN -- DRAGGED DOWN REALLY BY WHATS GOING ON AT ESPN.
IGER: IT'S ABERRATIONAL THIS QUARTER. LET'S BE CAREFUL. WE'VE SAID ALL ALONG WHEN A NEW CONTRACT WITH THE NBA KICKED IN, WHICH IS NOW, THAT IT WOULD HAVE AN APPRECIABLE EFFECT NOT JUST ON OUR QUARTER BUT ON THE 2017 RESULTS. WE ACTUALLY HAD AN INCREASE IN SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE IN THE QUARTER FROM OUR MEDIA NETWORKS THAT WAS SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY LOSSES IN SUBS – WE'VE SEEN A CONTINUING DECLINE IN SUBS AMONG OUR DISTRIBUTED NETWORKS, YES.
BOORSTIN: AND SO WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN TERMS OF OVERALL CORD-CUTTING IN THE TRADITIONAL TV BUSINESSES VERSUS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN GAINS FROM THE SKINNY BUNDLES? OR THE NEW DIGITAL STREAMING BUNDLES?
IGER: YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT BREAKING IT DOWN IN TERMS OF SPECIFICS. WE'VE SEEN GENERAL EROSION IN THE MULTI-CHANNEL ECOSYSTEM THAT'S PROBABLY DUE TO A NUMBER FACTORS: PEOPLE NOT SIGNING UP UNTIL LATER IN LIFE. SOME CORD-CUTTING, SOME MIGRATION TO SKINNIER BUNDLES. IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS. IT'S STILL, BY THE WAY, EXTREMELY PROFITABLE PRODUCT FOR OUR COMPANY AND FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES.
BOORSTIN: NOW TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE DISNEY APP THAT YOU'RE BUILDING FOR 2019. SOUND LIKE YOU'RE BUILDING A MINI NETFLIX.
IGER: WELL, WERE BUILDING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER DISNEY SERVICE. WE'VE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH NETFLIX. THEY HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTING IN THE PAY WINDOW DISNEY BRANDED MOVIES AND PIXAR-BRANDED MOVIES, MARVEL AND ""STAR WARS."" WE HAD A DEAL THAT GAVE US THE OPTION TO MOVE OUR FILMS FROM THE NETFLIX PLATFORM TO SOMEWHERE ELSE -- STARTING WITH A CALENDAR YEAR 2019 SLATE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.
SO WE'RE CREATING A DISNEY-BRANDED SERVICE THAT WILL HAVE THOSE MOVIES ON IT, AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE 2019 SLATE, IT INCLUDES ""FROZEN 2,"" ""TOY STORY 4"" AND A LIVE ACTION REMAKE OF LION KING, AS A FOR INSTANCE, SO ITS AN INCREDIBLE SLATE. IN ADDITION WE HAVE A FILM LIBRARY PRODUCT AND WE HAVE TV LIBRARY PRODUCT AND WE'LL BE MAKING A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN ORIGINAL CONTENT, BOTH MOVIES AND TELEVISION SERIES, FOR THIS PLATFORM EXCLUSIVELY. SO IF YOU'RE A FAMILY OR YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE DISNEY BRAND, YOU WANT IF YOU WANT TO SUBSCRIBE TO AN EXTREMELY RICH, ROBUST, DISNEY-BRANDED SERVICE, YOU'LL BE ABLE DO IT. IT WILL USE THE BAMTECH PLATFORM TO BASICALLY DRIVE OR POWER THE PRODUCT.
BOORSTIN: HOW BIG DO YOU THINK THE POTENTIAL AUDIENCE FOR THIS IS? DO YOU THINK THIS IS ON THE SCALE OF A NETFLIX, AND WILL YOU BE OFFERING IT OVERSEAS AND HERE IN THE U.S.?
IGER: THE DISNEY BRAND'S NEVER BEEN STRONGER. WE DO A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THAT. A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH PRODUCT CYCLE, A LOT OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH HOW WE'VE MANAGED THE BRAND OVER TIME. AND INTEREST IN DISNEY IS ONLY GROWING. THAT'S GLOBAL, BY THE WAY, IN NATURE. THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT WILL ROLL OUT IN MULTIPLE MARKETS INTERNATIONALLY WITH SOME DEGREE OF VARIATION MARKET-BY-MARKET BASED ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FACTORS. BUT ULTIMATELY, THIS WILL BE A GLOBAL PRODUCT, BUT IN 2019 WE'LL LAUNCH IN THE UNITED STATES, A DISNEY-BRANDED SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE DIRECT TO CONSUMER.
BOORSTIN: AND WILL THIS BE THE ENTIRE LIBRARY OF DISNEY MOVIES OR JUST THE MOVIES THAT YOU'RE BRINGING OVER FROM NETFLIX?
IGER: IT WILL BE A COMBINATION. IT WILL BE THE PAY MOVIES - THE PAY WINDOW, SO THAT MEANS IT GOES THEATRICAL WINDOW, THAT USED TO BE CALLED THE HOME VIDEO WINDOW, WHICH IS NOW DOMINATED BY DIGITAL SALES AND RENTAL. AND THEN POST THAT, THE WINDOW THAT NETFLIX HAS, THE DISNEY PIXAR MOVIES WILL BE ON THIS PLATFORM. IN ADDITIONAL TO THAT, WE'LL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DISNEY LIBRARY PRODUCT FROM THE DISNEY STUDIOS OVER TIME AND TELEVISION LIBRARY PRODUCT, BUT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN ORIGINAL DISNEY-BRANDED TELEVISION AND MOTION PICTURES FOR JUST THIS PLATFORM.
BOORSTIN: NETFLIX IS SPENDING ABOUT $6 BILLION THIS YEAR ON ORIGINAL CONTENT. HOW WILL YOUR SPENDING COMPARE TO THAT?
IGER: LESS.
BOORSTIN: LESS.
IGER: WE'LL BE INVESTING LESS.
BOORSTIN: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH NETFLIX. YOU ARE MAKING MARVEL TV SHOWS –
IGER: WE HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH NETFLIX. YES – THEY LICENSE IT.
BOORSTIN: WILL YOU PULL THOSE MARVEL SHOWS?
IGER: NO. WE HAVE NO PLANS TO PULL THAT. WE'VE HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP, THOSE ARE ORIGINAL SHOWS AND THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT WE'LL LICENSE OTHER THINGS TO THEM THEM DOWN THE ROAD. WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM ON IT. BUT FOR NOW, WHAT THIS IS NOW FOR US IS A DISNEY-BRANDED SERVICE, THAT YOU CAN BUY OF ON ITS OWN, NOT PART OF AN UBER BRAND – BASICALLY, ITS A DISNEY BRAND - AND WE THINK THAT THE TIME IS RIGHT TO DO THAT GIVEN THE TRENDS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN CONSUMPTION, THE VALUE OF THE DISNEY BRAND, THE PRODUCT CYCLE AND ALL THE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT BAMTECH PLATFORM NOW GIVES US.
BOORSTIN: AND WILL THIS PRICING BE COMPETITIVE WITH SAY, NETFLIX.
IGER: WE'RE – WE'VE GOT TIME TO DETERMINE WHAT THE PRICING WILL BE. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT AT THE POINT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE THAT.
BOORSTIN: DOES THIS LAY THE GROUNDWORK TO LAUNCH A MARVEL SERVICE OR ""STAR WARS"" SERVICE DOWN THE LINE?
IGER: WE HAVE THE TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO DO THAT. I GUESS YOU COULD SUGGEST BECAUSE OF THAT IT LAYS GROUNDWORK. THIS LAYS THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE COMPANY TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS. IT PROVIDES US WITH ALL SORTS OF OPTIONALITY THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD BEFORE. YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING TO SAY YOU'LL BE IN THE BUSINESS OF DIRECT TO CONSUMER OR OVER THE TOP, AND ITS ONE THING TO DO IT. AND TO DO IT YOU NEED A REALLY STRONG TECHNOLOGY ENGINE...AND THE TALENT THAT HAS THE EXPERIENCE TO MANAGE CUSTOMERS IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY THEN WE'VE MANAGED CUSTOMERS IN OUR MEDIA BUSINESSES CERTAINLY IN THE PAST.
BOORSTIN: CERTAINLY, A FASCINATING NEW DIRECTION FOR THE COMPANY. NOW, I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HIT ON THE THEME PARKS, WHICH SHOWED THE GREATEST GROWTH OF ANY OF YOUR DIVISIONS THIS QUARTER. LOOKING AT THE RESULTS YOU'VE THIS QUARTER AND THE BOOKINGS YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR, WHATS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN CONSUMER RIGHT NOW?
IGER: BASED ON WE'VE SEEN THAT AT OUR THEME PARKS, THE HEALTH OF THE AMERICAN CONSUMER IS VERY STRONG. AND A LOT HAS TO DO WITH THE INTEREST, I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE, INTEREST IN THE PRODUCT THAT WE'VE CREATED AND THE SERVICE THAT WE DELIVER.
IF YOU LOOK AT DISNEY WORLD AND DISNEY WORLD, BUT IF YOU ALSO LOOK AT PARIS AND TOKYO, AND HONG KONG AND OF COURSE SHANGHAI, THESE ARE GREAT PRODUCTS AND GREAT EXPERIENCES THAT TAP INTO ALL THE WONDERFUL IP THAT WE'VE CREATED. BUILDING TWO STAR WARS LANDS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE. OF THAT. BUT WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE ""GUARDIAN OF THE GALAXY"" AND THE LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT WE HAD WITH JIM CAMERON AND FOR PANDORA IN FLORIDA. THESE ARE INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCES AND SO THE BUSINESSES THAT WE RUN ARE QUITE HEALTHY. AND I TTHINK SUGGESTS THAT THE AMERICAN CONSUMER AND CONSUMERS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD ARE WILLING TO SPEND TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE DELIVER.
BOORSTIN: YOU DID REPORT HIGHER SPENDING AT A NUMBER OF YOUR DIFFERENT PARKS. AND YOU'RE SPENDING RIGHT NOW BILLIONS TO HAVE GREAT PARKS.... DO YOU ANTICIPATE, IF THERE IS AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, EITHER HERE OR CHINA, THAT IMPACTING YOUR RESULTS?
IGER: THEY MIGHT IMPACT OUR RESULTS SHORT TERM, IF THERE WERE A DOWNTURN. BUT WE'VE NEVER LOOKED AT THE BUSINESS AS SHORT TERM. IN FACT, WHEN WE HAD THE BIG DOWNTURN IN 2008, 2009, WE WERE AT A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE INVESTMENT CYCLE THAT PAID OFF WONDERFULLY FOR US IF YOU LOOK AT THE RESULTS, IN THE LAST DECADE ALMOST. SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE BUSINESS FOR THE LONG TERM. AND WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO MANAGE BUSINESSES LIKE THAT. IF YOU TRY TO MANAGE THE BUSINESSES YEAR BY YEAR OR QUARTER BY QUARTER THEN I THINK FRANKLY THEN YOU END YOU CREATING A SUBOPTIMAL EXPERIENCE FOR THE CONSUMER AND NOT REALLY BUILDING THE BUSINESS FOR THE LONG TERM.
BOORSTIN: ONE THING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN QUARTERS PAST IS THE NEED FOR CORPORATE TAX REFORM DISNEY PAYS A PARTICULARLY HIGH CORPORATE TAX RATE. DO YOU THINK WASHINGTON WILL BE ABLE TO GET CORPORATE TAX REFORM DONE?
IGER: I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT GOING TO BET ON THAT ONE. IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY COMPLICATED LIKE ALL THINGS IN WASHINGTON THESE DAYS. AND SO I'M GOING TO LAY A BET DOWN ON WHETHER IT WILL HAPPEN OR WHEN IT WOULD HAPPEN. WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE PAY AN UNUSUALLY HIGH CORPORATE TAX RATE. WE BELIEVE IF THERE WERE TAX LEGISLATION IT WOULD BENEFIT CORPORATIONS. ONE, IT LEVELS THE PLAYING FIELD, INTERNATIONALLY. TWO, IT WOULD GIVE US THE ABILITY ...TO RETURN CAPITAL TO INVESTORS, MORE CAPITAL TO INVESTORS AND INVEST MORE IN OUR BUSINESSES. AND EVEN CREATE MORE JOBS WHICH WE'VE BEEN DOING IN THE UNITED STATES. MORE CAPITAL WOULD GIVE US THE ABILITY TO EXPAND EVEN MORE.
BOORSTIN: BUT NO ODDS ON THE CHANCES OF IT HAPPENING.
IGER: UNLESS YOU'VE GOT THEM – I DON'T HAVE THEM.
BOORSTIN: I DON'T. NOW, YOU DROPPED OUT OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUSINESS ADVISORY COUNCIL IN JUNE AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP PULLED OUT OF THE PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. HAVE YOU -- YOU SAID ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO THAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A SEAT IN THE ROOM WHEN THAT HAPPENS. HAVE YOU BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE PRESIDENT SINCE THEN?
IGER: I HAVE NOT, NO.
BOORSTIN: AND JUST A FINAL QUESTION SINCE THE NEW STREAMING SERVICE IS OF SO MUCH INTEREST. DO YOU THINK THAT OTHER COMPANIES WILL START DOING WHAT DISNEY HAS DONE IN CREATING THEIR OWN DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER SERVICES INSTEAD OF USING NETFLIX? IS THAT A STREAMING OPTION?
IGER: I CAN'T COMMENT MUCH ABOUT THE OTHER COMPANIES. I KNOW THE INVESTMENT WE'RE MAKING IS SIGNIFICANT – NOT EVERYONE HAS, NOT ALL COMPANIES HAVE ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF PRODUCT, IT'S VERY VITAL TO WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND NOT ALL COMPANIES HAVE BRANDS LIKE WE HAVE – WHETHER IT'S ESPN OR DISNEY OR PIXAR, SO I THINK THAT OBVIOUSLY GIVES US QUITE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST I DON'T THINK YOU'LL SEE MUCH OF THIS FROM OTHER COMPANIES BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT RUNNING THOSE COMPANIES.

 Cramer Remix: What Disney’s shot at Netflix means for stocks   
 7:15  PM ET Tue,  8 Aug 2017 |  01:27 
 After Disney issued its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday and announced it would end its partnership with Netflix, Jim Cramer watched shares of Netflix drop with intrigue.
 ""It's sinking more in after-hours [trading] on the news that Disney is ending its movie deal with Netflix [in] 2019, in part so it can do its own streaming service, although that news isn't stopping Disney's stock itself from declining on a revenue miss in part from weaker cable numbers, even as the earnings were better than expected,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Disney and Pixar movies will be moved off Netflix's platform towards the end of 2018. Also on Tuesday, Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC that the two companies have a ""good relationship.""
 The entertainment giant is also planning to launch its own streaming service for its sports network, ESPN, which drove a 23 percent decline in Disney's cable operating income.
Netflix's stock was down more than 3 percent in after-hours trading as of Tuesday evening.
In addition to tracking its decline, Cramer also reviewed the retail stocks that are finally starting to stand up to the dominant force of Amazon.
 Off the Charts: Paper-to-Plastic Payoff
 Scott Eells | Bloomberg | Getty Images
 Cramer loves when strong, secular themes drive stocks. One of his favorites has been the shift from paper to plastic as credit cards increasingly dominate payments worldwide.
""As we move closer to a cashless society, I want to go off the charts with the help of Bob Lang,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""I want to get a better sense of what's happening with the four major credit card companies. Of course, we're talking about Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover.""
Cramer began with the daily chart of Visa, the largest credit card issuer of the four. Up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017, Visa is one of the Dow Jones Industrial average's top components, partially responsible for the average's recent 22,000 landmark, Cramer said.
 Intel, the Market's Latest Comeback Kid

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich
 After Intel completed its $15 billion tender offer to buy Mobileye on Tuesday, Cramer wondered whether the deal was a sign that the tech giant was making a serious comeback.
""For years, we watched as Intel hung out on the fringes of the great markets, great markets like mobile devices, the internet of things, anything Apple [and] the autonomous car,"" Cramer said.
With its purchase of Mobileye, an Israeli tech company specializing in self-driving technology and collision prevention, Intel is entering the autonomous driving space with one of its top innovators under its wing.
Intel is also reportedly seizing on the rift between chipmaker Qualcomm and Apple by supplying semiconductor chips and modems for Apple's tablets and, potentially, the new Apple Watch.
""I cannot stress enough just how important this is for the company that pioneered the microprocessor for the personal computer,"" Cramer said.
 Brushing Up with Henry Schein's CEO
 Scott Mlyn | CNBC 
Stanley Bergman, CEO, Henry Schein
 Then, Cramer sat down with Stanley Bergman, the chairman and CEO of health care equipment and service provider Henry Schein, to speak more about the company's secular drivers.
Bergman said that while the global expansion of the middle class was helping overall sales, even more pertinent is the rise of ""digital-ization"" across the medical space.
""The dental equipment market is doing very, very well as that market digitalizes,"" Bergman told Cramer on Tuesday. ""Align is a typical example of the digital-ization of an industry, and they have digitalized, in a very successful way, the orthodontics space.""
And as his company enjoys stable, 4-to-6 percent sales growth, Bergman said that Henry Schein will welcome and seize on these developments as they progress.
""That market is on fire. Anything to do with digital – imaging, prosthetics – is advancing in a very rapid way,"" he said.
 Meritor CEO: Trucking, Electrified
 Scott Mlyn | CNBC 
Jay Craig, CEO, Meritor
 Cramer also spoke with Jay Craig, the CEO of truck component manufacturer Meritor. Craig told Cramer on Tuesday that as his ""hardcore manufacturing"" company grows hand in hand with the economy, management is exploring some unique options related to the future of trucking.
""We have a big push on electrification right now,"" Craig told Cramer, referring to the burgeoning trend of building vehicles to run using electric power rather than traditional fuel.
Along with bringing cleaner energy sources to the trucking industry, the CEO said this initiative could help start more buzz about under-the-radar names like Meritor.
""We think we're establishing a strong position in that marketplace as we see the trend of commercial vehicles most likely moving where life vehicles are, more highly electrified, and we think that will start to catch some people's attention that may not have looked at us,"" Craig said.
 Lightning Round: No One Ever Got Hurt Buying KMB
 In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some callers' favorite stocks, including:
Kimberly Clark: ""Yeah, it doesn't have the growth that Clorox has, frankly. It's got a 3 percent yield. No one ever got hurt buying Kimberly Clark. I prefer Procter [& Gamble] and Clorox to it.""
Southwest Airlines: ""My charitable trust owns Southwest Air. I'm going to discuss it tomorrow with my ActionAlertsPlus.com members call at 11:30. Here's a preview: I like it very much and if it got back to $52, $53, I'd buy back the stock for the trust that the trust sold in the $60s.""

Reed Hastings, Netflix CEO
 Netflix is one of the market's best-performing stocks and one Wall Street firm says its shares will continue to surge due to more impressive growth in foreign markets.Piper Jaffray told its clients the company's international subscriber base will nearly double in three years from the current 52 million. The firm reiterated its overweight rating on the video streaming company's shares. ""International growth is clearly the primary focus of NFLX investors; one of the most consistent concerns we hear, regarding ongoing growth potential, is the challenge the service will face gaining adoption in lower-income markets,"" analyst Michael Olson wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""Our analysis suggests that Netflix can reach 100M international subs by 2020, with zero or very minimal penetration in lower-income international markets.""
Olson raised his price target for Netflix shares to $215 from $198, representing 19 percent upside from Monday's close.  Netflix is one of the market's best-performing names. Its shares have rallied 46.5 percent this year through Monday versus the S&P 500's 10.8 percent return. The analyst presented a number of scenarios where the streaming video company can reach the 100 million subscriber level by 2020. He noted if Netflix can attain only 25 percent share of upper-income segment [above $18,600 per year] in international markets, it can reach the 100 million mark with no share of the lower-income demographic. None of his analysis includes any China penetration. ""Based on this, we are increasing our international subscriber estimate for 2020 (ending Q4) to 100M and believe this could still be conservative,"" he wrote. Netflix added a better-than-expected 5.2 million total subscribers during the second quarter compared with the Wall Street consensus for 3.2 million and now has 104 million total subscribers.

 David Letterman to return to TV in Netflix series   
 11:37  AM ET Tue,  8 Aug 2017 |  00:29 
 David Letterman will return to TV in 2018 in a new Netflix series. 
 The six-episode series will feature the late-night television host interviewing notable people in addition to doing on-the-scene segments, according to Netflix. Each episode will be an hour. The show does not have a title yet. 
Letterman is the longest-serving late-night television host in U.S. history, spending 33 years in the role. He left CBS' ""The Late Show"" in 2014. 
 ""I feel excited and lucky to be working on this project for Netflix,"" the 70-year-old Letterman said in a release. ""Here's what I have learned, if you retire to spend more time with your family, check with your family first. Thanks for watching, drive safely.""

The New York Public Library has teamed up with online video-streaming service Kanopy to offer patrons its collection of arthouse, independent and classical films on demand.
 If Netflix and Hulu are boring you with crass, lowbrow content, if you gravitate to arthouse and indie movies, if you're less into Song of Ice and Fire and more into India Song, it might be worth checking out your local library. But no need to get up from the couch and potentially spill your can of Pabst over your perfectly manicured beard — you can now stream these movies directly to your device.
 Public libraries might be fighting with Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu for your eyeballs in the online content wars.
Last Friday the New York Public Library let patrons stream videos and movies for the first time. The service, which is run by online video-streaming service Kanopy, includes a collection of arthouse, independent and classical films on demand. Users can browse content on the Kanopy website after logging into the NYPL online. ""This content offering is so unique and worth presenting and logical to us that it makes absolute sense to do so,"" said Christopher Platt, chief branch library officer of the NYPL.
 Platt says offering movies for streaming is part of the library's perpetual goal to offer formats patrons need.

It's also hard to argue with a service that's free. Derek O'Donnell, senior analyst at Gartner, said the library's service might hit smaller players in the streaming space, like Amazon Prime, which has a thinner selection of streaming movies compared to larger competitors, like Hulu and Netflix. The library's offering may also find a niche with audiences seeking content inaccessible anywhere else, O'Donnell said.
The launch also reflects changing trends: mobile, connected and oftentimes younger users. A Fall 2016 Pew Research Center survey found 53 percent of millennials used a public library or bookmobile in the last 12 months, compared to 45 percent of Gen Xers and only 43 percent of baby boomers.
San Francisco-based Kanopy sees itself as an alternative — and not a competitor — to more mainstream services, like Netflix. ""Many users come to watch films that aren't available on other platforms,"" said Kanopy CEO Olivia Humphrey. The emphasis, she says, is on ""thoughtful entertainment"" and focuses on independent films that touch on topics like immigration, diversity and LGBT rights. ""It's really a different reason for coming to watch Kanopy,"" said Humphrey.
Kanopy — founded in 2008 in Western Australia — previously partnered with universities such as Yale and the University of Cambridge to make Kanopy's collection of films available to students for study. The company most recently launched their service to patrons of the Los Angeles Public Library and other regional libraries, in Illinois, Connecticut, California and other states, before the NYPL rollout. The company has partnered with local libraries across the country in the past and says other, smaller libraries are to be added soon.
The NYPL, which serves more than 17 million patrons across Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, launched the service with Kanopy collection last Friday to offer ""quality, literate"" movies to its patrons. The service is available now to all NYPL patrons with a valid library card.

 Netflix CEO Reed Hastings reportedly confronted Peter Thiel on 'catastrophically bad' Trump endorsement   
 11:09  AM ET Wed,  9 Aug 2017 |  00:43 
 Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who sits on Facebook's board of directors, wrote an email to fellow board member Peter Thiel castigating him for his ""catastrophically bad"" judgment in supporting Donald Trump for president, according to a report in the New York Times.
 Hastings chairs the Facebook board's Compensation and Governance Committee, which is responsible for evaluating board members. Last August, ahead of a meeting of that committee, Hastings reportedly emailed Thiel to warn him that his speech supporting Trump at the Republican National Convention was reason to question his suitability on the board.
""Some diversity in views is healthy, but catastrophically bad judgment (in my view) is not what anyone wants in a fellow board member,"" Hastings wrote.
 Both men are still on Facebook's board. Neither Netflix nor Facebook immediately responded to requests for comment.
Thiel has recently expressed misgivings about his support for the president in private events, according to a report in Buzzfeed, although he remains a strong supporter in his public statements.

 Disney will pull its movies from Netflix and start its own streaming services   
 6:17  PM ET Tue,  8 Aug 2017 |  01:09 
 Netflix is down big after hours following Disney's announcement that it will pull its library of content from Netflix.
 Disney said it will launch its own streaming service in 2019 and will also launch a separate dedicated streaming service for ESPN content as early as next year.
Disney CEO Bob Iger said the new service will include Disney Pixar movies, a ""significant amount of Disney products from the studios over time"" and a library of television content. ""We're going to make a significant investment in original Disney-branded television and motion pictures for just this platform,"" Iger said.
 Netflix shares were down more than 4 percent as of 4:16 pm ET in extended trading.
The loss of Disney's library will be a big hit to Netflix given that it provides plenty of both new and nostalgic content. Wall Street might also be worried that other Netflix partners could follow suit, especially if Disney is successful in moving out as an individual player in the space.
CNBC reached out to Netflix for comment but a spokesperson was not immediately available.
— CNBC's Michelle Castillo contributed to this report.

 Disney will pull its movies from Netflix and start its own streaming services   
 6:17  PM ET Tue,  8 Aug 2017 |  01:09 
 Disney wants to own a bigger piece of the streaming pie. 
 The company announced during its latest earnings report on Tuesday it intends to remove its movies from Netflix. 
Instead, Disney plans to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 starting in the U.S. and expanding globally. 
 CEO Bob Iger told CNBC's Julia Boorstin Disney had a ""good relationship"" with Netflix, but decided to exercise an option to move its content off the platform. Movies to be removed include Disney as well as Pixar's titles, according to Iger. Netflix said Disney movies will be available through the end of 2018 on its platform. Marvel TV shows will remain. 
The new platform will be the home for all Disney movies going forward, starting with the 2019 theatrical slate which includes ""Toy Story 4,"" ""Frozen 2,"" and the upcoming live-action ""The Lion King."" It will also be making a ""significant investment"" in exclusive movies and television series for the new platform. 
 The company will also launch its own ESPN video streaming service in early 2018. The platform, which will feature about 10,000 sporting events each year, will have content from the MLB, NHL, MLS, collegiate sports and tennis' Grand Slam events. 
To power the services, Disney is buying a majority ownership of BAM Tech for $1.58 billion. Disney bought a 33 percent stake in the company, which was spun off from digital media company MLB Advanced Media, in August 2016. 
""This represents a big strategic shift for the company,"" Iger said to CNBC. ""We felt that having control of a platform we've been very impressed with after buying 33 percent of it a year ago would give us control of our destiny.""
Netflix stock dropped more than 5 percent upon announcement of the news.

 Netflix stock drops on fears others will follow Disney's lead by pulling content and starting competitor   
 11:24  AM ET Wed,  9 Aug 2017 |  00:59 
 Netflix investors are worrying Disney will not be the last to pull video content from the internet streaming giant. Disney announced Tuesday it intends to remove its movies from Netflix and launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019. Netflix shares fell in the post-market session following the news and opened down 3.9 percent on Wednesday. ""Disney's decision to end its distribution deal with Netflix (beginning in 2019) supports our long-held view that content owners will increasingly look to retain content for owned platforms,"" Jefferies analyst John Janedis wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""What is unclear is whether or not the largely staggered impact will affect NFLX's growth in net adds. NFLX's content investment likely assumed some non-renewals."" Janedis reiterated his hold rating and his $165 price target for Netflix shares, representing 7.5 percent downside to Tuesday's close. One analyst is also concerned Netflix may lose television content from Disney, which owns ABC and Marvel, in the future. ""Questions remain, namely … any future loss of ABC and/or Marvel originals production,"" SunTrust analyst Matthew Thornton wrote Wednesday. ""Beyond NFLX loss of some DIS content, DIS's announcement obviously indicates incremental DTC [direct to consumer] streaming competition, particularly for kids audience, beginning 2H19 in the U.S. and Int'l thereafter."" To be sure, others on Wall Street defended the company and said the Disney move will not have a large effect on Netflix's growth momentum. ""While this will be a negative headline for Netflix, we expect the actual impact on the subscriber base to be minimal,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson wrote Wednesday. ""There is no question Disney content was a 'nice to have,' but we believe Netflix can find ways to re-allocate … to create similarly engaging (and more exclusive) content for its subscriber base."" Olson estimated Disney content represents only 3 percent of Netflix's annual content costs. He reiterated his overweight rating for Netflix shares and his $215 price target. ""Netflix may be losing content from its most important supplier in Disney, but its strategy to pivot to originals, build its own global content brand, and vertically integrate into self production mitigate this loss,"" Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne wrote Wednesday. The streaming company is one of the market's best-performing names. Its shares have rallied 44.1 percent this year through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return. Netflix did not immediately return a request for comment.

24,2017-08-10,"With Disney’s move to streaming, a new era begins  ","Katie Kramer | CNBC 
Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Company.
 Disney set off a sonic boom in Hollywood by unveiling plans to start two Netflix-style services: For the first time in the streaming age, the world's largest media company had decided that embracing a new business model was more important than clinging to its existing one.
Disney's decision to better align itself with consumer trends — deemed ""a rare and impressive pivot"" by RBC Capital Markets — instantly reverberated through the entertainment industry. Disney's cable channels, which include ESPN, have long been seen as the reason many viewers were refraining from cutting the cord entirely. If Disney was going all in on streaming, the impact would be felt by almost every television company and cable operator.
As part of its announcement on Tuesday, Disney said that it would spend heavily on original programming for its entertainment streaming service and pull future Disney and Pixar movies from Netflix. That sent Netflix shares downward. The question seemed to be, how would Netflix, even with its head start in terms of audience and reach, manage without the mighty mouse? And would Disney's plunge into streaming encourage the likes of Discovery and Viacom to do the same, intensifying competition?
 More from New York Times: Facebook introduces a dedicated home for videosSeeso, comedy streaming service, will shut down later this year Answering your questions about the controversial Google memo
And would viewers who want to eschew traditional cable subscriptions eventually find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer number of streaming services they would need to cobble together to watch what they wanted to watch?
On Wednesday, as analysts and investors scratched for answers, few firm ones emerged. In a research report, Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen and Company, summed up Disney's streaming plans, especially for movies and television, as ""aggressively"" pushing ""the traditional content business into terra incognita.""
Underscoring the uncertainty, Disney's shares declined by more than 4 percent on Wednesday, to $102.83. The company reported a  9 percent decline in quarterly profit on Tuesday, which may have led to the sell-off. Wider weakness in financial markets did not help.
Disney investors may also be worried about the enormous spending it will take to build two streaming services. Some might have been underwhelmed by the company's plans or might have thought that the decision came much too late.
While a few ardent Disney critics  held that view, most analysts applauded the company's move.
""What Disney is doing is a really big deal in terms of trying new things, and I don't think it even has answers to some of these questions, including what the services will cost,"" said Michael Vorhaus, president of Magid Advisors, a media and digital video consultancy. ""But it's clearly not the end of linear television. It's not the end of Netflix.""
Disney's streaming plans call for the introduction early next year of a subscription service to be built around ESPN's sports programming. It will be powered by BamTech, a technology company that handles direct-to-consumer video for baseball teams and HBO, among others. Disney paid  $1 billion a year agofor a 33 percent stake in BamTech. On Tuesday, Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, announced that Disney had accelerated an option to spend $1.58 billion for an additional 42 percent share.
But this still-unnamed subscription service is designed to protect the cable bundle, at least initially. The service will offer only sports programming that is not available on ESPN's traditional channels. Only people who also pay to receive ESPN the old-fashioned way (via a cable or satellite hookup) will be able to stream ESPN's core offerings, including N.F.L. and N.B.A. games.
Mr. Iger has also made an important calculation that Disney — unlike most of its competitors — has programming that is must-have in the old model (cable and satellite) and in the new (streaming). Put another way, Disney has the power to introduce streaming offerings around ESPN, Pixar films and Disney Channel shows without worrying about being dropped by third-party distributors, including upstarts like Sling TV and PlayStation Vue.
PlayStation Vue, for instance, tried to introduce a ""skinny"" television package without ESPN in March 2015 and drew little consumer interest. When PlayStation Vue started offering ESPN in spring 2016, the distributor quickly started gaining traction.
Children's programming, an obvious strength for Disney, has proved especially important for streaming services. Amazon last year  acquired a significant amount of PBS's library of original series to exclusively stream on its service, and  Netflix has said it expects to have 75 original children's programs by the end of next year.
Disney's announcement had an immediate impact on Netflix, as the news media raced to pit the two companies against each other, and some investors worried about Disney taking back its movies. (Starting in late 2019, new-release Disney and Pixar films will move to Disney's entertainment-focused streaming service.) On Wednesday, Netflix shares declined 1.5 percent, to $175.78.
Omar Sheikh, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said Disney's move ""arguably reduces the consumer value of Netflix.""
But most analysts contended that the news was less worrisome for Netflix than it would initially seem. ""We don't view this as a strike at Netflix, as the content being pulled is actually rather limited,"" said Mr. Creutz of Cowan and Company.
Disney has not yet decided whether to pull its Marvel or ""Star Wars"" movies from Netflix. Netflix will not lose access to Marvel-branded television shows like ""The Defenders"" because Netflix is a co-producer of them.
Executives at Disney and Netflix declined to comment publicly on Wednesday. In a statement on Tuesday, Netflix said, ""We continue to do business with the Walt Disney Company on many fronts, including our ongoing deal with Marvel TV.""
Notably, Netflix has been building up a huge original movie operation, including spending the $90 million ""Bright,"" a forthcoming Will Smith movie. Netflix plans to start making as many as 50 of its own movies annually.
BamTech, which Disney plans to use as the backbone of its streaming services, has substantial operations. But Disney faces a steep learning curve. By the time Disney even introduces its entertainment-based service in 2019, Netflix will have about 64 million subscribers in the United States and 158 million worldwide, according to BTIG Research.
Disney would probably contend that Netflix's head start is irrelevant.
""It's high time we got in this business,"" Mr. Iger told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday. ""The profitability, the revenue-generating capability of this initiative is substantially greater than the business models we're currently being served by.""
In the end, there was only one aspect of Disney's move that everyone seemed to agree on: The streaming boom is only beginning.
Netflix, Amazon, HBO Now, CBS All Access and Hulu (part-owned by Disney) are all barreling ahead online. FX is  dipping a toe in the water with Comcast. AMC has done the same. And now comes Disney with two services, which will undoubtedly prod other entertainment giants to move beyond niche direct-to-consumer offerings.
The race for streaming supremacy, Mr. Creutz said, ""may well accelerate problems for the whole ecosystem via atomization of content and an overpopulation of content apps.""

Reed Hastings, chief executive officer of Netflix, speaks during a news conference in Tokyo on Monday, June 27, 2016.
 Goldman Sachs is encouraging clients to invest in high-growth stocks, predicting that higher interest rates in 2018 will cause earnings expansion to slow, therefore placing a premium value on fast-growing companies.
 ""The majority of the recent market rally has been driven by higher earnings rather than valuation expansion,"" wrote Goldman Sachs chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin. ""Going forward, we expect growth to continue to drive S&P 500 stock returns. We expect that the prospect of 4 Fed rate hikes in 2018 will result in a forward P/E contraction.""
Kostin isolated firms allocating 90 percent of cash flow from operations to fund growth initiatives during the past three years into a ""High Growth Investment"" basket, including Netflix and chipmaker Nvidia.
 To insulate the effects of reductions in earnings multiples, Kostin recommended these high growth stocks to investors.
 Fifty-five percent of S&P 500 companies have beaten earnings expectations in the second quarter, the highest share of companies since 2010. Kostin reiterated that Goldman expects the S&P 500 will end 2017 at 2,400, slightly below its current level.
While information technology and health care have led the charge, investors have been slow to reward companies beating expectations with 2018 revisions, hinting at the market's belief in future pressure on multiples in the market.

 In a huge blow to ABC and Disney, the prolific television hitmaker Shonda Rhimes has signed an exclusive overall deal with Netflix, the streaming giant announced early Monday morning.
Ms. Rhimes, the creator of shows like ""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""Scandal,"" and ""How To Get Away With Murder"" — all hits for ABC — will bring Shondaland over to Netflix in what the streaming service said was a multiyear deal.
Those series and ones currently in development will remain on ABC, though Netflix already has the streaming rights for the back library for shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Scandal.""

Netflix's move amounts to a major counterpunch to Disney's announcement last week that it was starting a pair of its own streaming services, including one that would force the removal of several Disney and Pixar movies from Netflix in the next two years.
Netflix's chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, said in a statement, ""I've gotten the chance to know Shonda and she's a true Netflixer at heart — she loves TV and films, she cares passionately about her work, and she delivers for her audience.""
Ms. Rhimes said in her own statement, ""Shondaland's move to Netflix is the result of a shared plan Ted Sarandos and I built based on my vision for myself as a storyteller and for the evolution of my company. Ted provides a clear, fearless space for creators at Netflix. He understood what I was looking for — the opportunity to build a vibrant new storytelling home for writers with the unique creative freedom and instantaneous global reach provided by Netflix's singular sense of innovation. The future of Shondaland at Netflix has limitless possibilities.""
Ms. Rhimes has been with ABC for more than a decade and has long been one of the biggest names at the network. She has been a reliable generator of hits, including building an entire Thursday night lineup that ABC's marketing department has dubbed #TGIT.
Though it has been a ratings force, ABC's Thursday night lineup has showed some signs of wear and tear recently. ""Grey's Anatomy,"" which will begin season 14 in September, remains a big hit with sturdy ratings, but both ""Scandal"" and ""How to Get Away With Murder"" have seen their ratings nose-dive in the last two years. One of Ms. Rhimes's newer shows, ""The Catch,"" was canceled this year.
ABC announced this year that ""Scandal"" will end after this coming season, something that the network tried to turn into a marketing bonanza at its annual advertiser pitch in May.
Ms. Rhimes's development slate at ABC will not suddenly vaporize. In addition to keeping its Thursday night lineup for the coming season, ABC still has a midseason show that is expected from Ms. Rhimes, titled ""For The People,"" and a ""Grey's Anatomy"" spinoff that is in preproduction, among some other projects in development.
Nevertheless, losing her is enormous for ABC and its corporate parent, Disney. The network finished in last place among the advertiser-coveted demographic for a second straight season, and though it is doing fine with comedies, it badly needs a hit drama. In the coming season, the network has been pinning its hopes on revivals like ""American Idol"" and ""Roseanne"" to help improve its standing in the ratings.
In a statement, ABC's entertainment president, Channing Dungey, said, ""I'm proud to have given a home to what have become some of the most celebrated and talked about shows on television. With the launch of a new season upon us, fans can rest assured that TGIT remains intact and will be as buzzed about as ever.""
For Netflix, this is more of the same.
The streaming service has been on an unprecedented spending spree, spreading billions on acquiring big-name talent.
In addition to cornering the market on stand-up comics like Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle, just last week the streaming service said it was bringing in the Coen Brothers for a new limited series and David Letterman for a new TV show.
The latest moves come just as digital rivals like Apple and Facebook have taken steps that suggest they are prepared to become serious players in the scripted and unscripted television game.

 Bitcoin market cap is within touching distance of major stocks like Netflix   
 8:58  AM ET Tue, 15 Aug 2017 |  00:36 
 Bitcoin hit another record high on Tuesday, with the continuing rally bringing its market capitalization within touching distance of major stocks like Netflix. 
 The price of the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $4,483.55 in early trade on Tuesday, continuing the strong rally seen in the past couple of weeks, according to industry website CoinDesk. Bitcoin did dip, however, as low as  $4,265.29 on the day. 
Bitcoin's market capitalization — the total number of coins in circulation multiplied by the price — also hit $73.5 billion when the record high was hit, Coinmarketcap data shows. This makes it the highest market capitalization yet.
 If bitcoin was a stock (which it isn't), it would be the seventy-fourth biggest by market capitalization, just behind Adobe and Netflix on the S&P 500. Adobe has a market cap of $73.6 billion while Netflix is worth $73.8 billion, putting bitcoin within touching distance of both.

Of course, many investors see bitcoin as a commodity or currency. It also has a finite supply at 21 million bitcoin which will not be reached for several years.

Netflix content executive director, Ted Sarandos attends the Vive Netflix 2017 at Museo Casa de la Bola on August 2, 2017 in Mexico City, Mexico.
 Disney made big waves recently when it said it would remove its movies from Netflix by 2019.
 But in an interview with Variety, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said the company is preparing for a future without Disney — or any other major media company.
""I would say that the relationship between studios and networks has always been that of a 'frenemy,'"" Sarandos told Variety.
 So Netflix is pushing ahead with even more original content, Sarandos said. It's currently $20.5 billion in debt and tied up in studio commitment deals, but the company isn't overspending despite the mounting costs, he said.
Although it started out five years ago licensing first-window rights — meaning shows would have to debut on Netflix — it's focusing on creating more of its own shows like ""Stranger Things."" It also has 17 local market series, which it hopes to grow to up to 100 shows over the next few years, according to Sarandos. It is persuading showrunners like Shonda Rhimes to leave their network homes, and noted filmmakers like the Coen brothers to enter TV.
The company is also dabbling in unscripted reality TV including competition show ""Ultimate Beastmaster"" and the upcoming David Letterman project. It has about 50 shows in the genre in development.
As for growing pressure from Amazon, which has already found success in the movie space with titles like ""Manchester by the Sea,"" Sarandos said he doesn't consider it a competitor.
""I don't think we compete with Amazon in the movie space at all,"" he told Variety, referring to how the company releases movies in theaters first. ""I frankly don't understand their strategy. I don't understand why perpetuating a model that feels more and more disconnected with the population is good.""

 How Southeast Asia's start-up scene is finding funds

 The debate over the rise of online video streaming is usually framed as a battle between new streaming platforms and traditional television services, but one serial tech entrepreneur begs to differ.
 ""We believe our number-one competitor is not linear TV. We believe our number-one competitor is digital and physical piracy,"" iFlix Co-founder and Chairman Patrick Grove told CNBC's ""Managing Asia.""
IFlix, based in Malaysia, is video on demand service targeting users in emerging markets. That's an attempt to carve out a niche while global giants like Netflix expand into Asia.
 Grove, who is also the co-founder and CEO of Catcha Group, counts iFlix as part of his portfolio of internet businesses. It secured $133 million in funding earlier this month in an investment round led by Hearst, according to media reports.

 This entrepreneur took 5 companies from start-up to IPO   
 3:09  AM ET Mon, 14 Aug 2017 |  01:01 
 Where traditional television stations with linear programming might refer to Nielsen ratings when determining the line-up of programs to broadcast, Grove and his team at iFlix chose a more unorthodox metric to study in their bid to pick shows users wanted to watch.
""We looked at piracy data in every market,"" Grove said.
""We would go to pirated DVD shops, which is a little bit risky, (and) I'd send teams to buy the top 20 pirated DVDs in every market. And then we'd go to the internet service providers (and say), 'Can we look at your streaming data.' ... And from that, we'd get a data set,"" Grove explained.
To illustrate, Grove said the team at iFlix studied digital and physical piracy data to draft a ""hit list"" of the top 1,000 shows in Saudi Arabia before the service launched in the country. 
""We believe that data is far better than any other way of measuring what are the top shows that people like the watch,"" Grove said. The information provided iFlix with real consumer insights compared to the linear TV model of programming, which involves guesswork, he added. 
Going forward, Grove said he has big ambitions for the video streaming service, which currently averages around just 5 million users.
""It might sound crazy to other people, but it doesn't sound crazy to us. Our vision for iFlix is that we want to touch 1 billion viewers ... in the next five years.""

 Bitcoin's market value tops that of Netflix   
 3:09  PM ET Thu, 17 Aug 2017 |  00:44 
 Bitcoin climbed above $4,500 to a record high Thursday, giving it a market valuation larger than that of once high-flying technology stock Netflix.
 The digital currency rose about 2 percent to a new high of $4,522.13 on Thursday, according to CoinDesk.
Bitcoin has a market value of about $74 billion, up $30 billion in August and topping Netflix's $72.7 billion market capitalization. Netflix shares Thursday were more than 1 percent lower amid a broader stock market decline. The stock traded nearly 13 percent below its all-time high hit July 21.
 The video streaming stock along with Facebook, Amazon.com and Google's parent Alphabet are collectively known as ""FANG"" and have been U.S. stock market leaders in the last few years as investors bet on the transformative technologies. In 2015, Netflix and Amazon.com were the only S&P 500 stocks to double in price.

 That said, bitcoin is not a stock and comparisons to other stocks' market value, especially major U.S. market gainers like Netflix, are more to illustrate the significant size of interest in the digital currency.
In addition, bitcoin's market value theoretically reflects interest in the potential for bitcoin to become a global means of payment.
At the very least, many digital currency enthusiasts expect bitcoin to become ""digital gold."" But gold's market value of about $7.5 trillion dwarfs that of bitcoin by 100 times.
At Thursday's record highs, bitcoin would rank 72nd by market value in the S&P 500 and 28th in the Dow Jones industrial average, just behind American Express' $78 billion market capitalization.
Bitcoin's market value also tops those of leaders in a variety of major industries, including software company Adobe, financial technology firm PayPal, investment giant BlackRock, industrial company Caterpillar and package shipping company FedEx.
To Ari Paul, chief investment officer of cryptocurrency investment firm BlockTower Capital, a better analogy is comparing bitcoin with PayPal's market capitalization.
""PayPal was initially created with a similar vision to bitcoin — as permissionless money,"" Paul said. ""PayPal wasn't able to fulfill that vision, but bitcoin is well on the way. Bitcoin can be used to transfer $100 million anywhere in the world in 10 minutes and for less than $2. Bitcoin rising in value above PayPal reflects its growing role as the best way to move money globally.""

 However, the three other FANG stocks and Apple, which has the largest market capitalization at $824 billion, still each have market values far greater than that of bitcoin. General Electric, Chevron and MasterCard also have far larger market capitalizations than bitcoin. 
Analysts said bitcoin's latest climb is a relief rally following the uneventful split of bitcoin into bitcoin and bitcoin cash earlier this month. Increased interest in bitcoin, especially from institutional investors, has helped the digital currency more than quadruple in price this year, analysts said.
Netflix shares hold gains of about 35 percent this year but have fallen about 8 percent in August after Disney announced last week it will pull its movies fromthe service and start its own streaming platforms.

 New Netflix series 'Ozark' is full of money advice you shouldn't take   
 3:08  PM ET Thu, 17 Aug 2017 |  00:52 
 A new Netflix drama series ""Ozark"" (think ""Breaking Bad"" on water) focuses on corrupt Chicago-based financial advisor Marty Byrde, who launders money for Mexican drug dealers.
 While you may not see this scenario play out in real life, the show does give investors plenty of red flags and warnings to consider with whoever is managing their money.
Warning: Spoilers below.
 When Byrde's business partner decides to skim some cash from the cartel, the bad guys don't take too kindly to that. Byrde (played by Jason Bateman) flees with his wife, Wendy, (Laura Linney) and kids — after convincing the cartel he can hide even more money among those rubes at Missouri's Lake of the Ozarks in return for sparing his life.
 Source: Netflix
Jason Bateman and Laura Linney star in Netflix's series Ozark.
 That the locals prove to be as crafty as Marty is one of the conceits of the program. The cast of characters includes ""hillbillies"" who live in broken-down mobile homes, a rogue FBI agent who trashes motel rooms and seduces a witness and local drug dealers who distribute their wares in hollowed-out hymnals at a pastor's weekly sermon on the lake.
Along the way, a bunch of financial advice is ladled out — most of which is questionable at best. Here's a sampler:
 Not properly vetting your adviser
 Marty's partner is a master at sweet-talking new clients, essentially hustling them to sign on with the firm. Scant evidence is offered about their qualifications. The message for you: Never pick an advisor without doing your homework. (See our graphic below for the best tips.) Just because Aunt Tillie vouches for him is not good enough.
Ironically, the one who does do some checking is the cartel's rep (Esai Morales) who goes around town testing advisors with a set of cooked books. Only Marty, a purported numbers whiz, is clever enough to spot the rounding errors (huh?) on the balance sheet signifying siphoned-off cash. The cartel's previous advisor is later murdered (not recommended). 
 Handing over cash
 An advisor shouldn't be holding your cash and investments. That's what custodians like Schwab, Fidelity and Vanguard are there to do.
Be suspicious of performance statements that come solely from an advisor that you can't verify with the actual firm that has custody of your money. Make sure you can access your accounts either electronically or over the phone or by walking into a branch office. That's one way how Bernie Madoff duped his clients for years — with fake statements.
 High-pressure sales tactics
 In several episodes, potential clients are told a ""fund"" was about to close or was ""not accepting"" any more new clients unless they buy in and pony up cash. If you hear this sort of nonsense, get up and leave. No reputable advisor should ever deal this way.
 Withdrawing $8 million (in cash) from a bank
 OK, it should be pretty obvious why this is a not a smart move. Not to mention that U.S. banks must inform the federal government of any transaction of more than $10,000. Kind of a bad idea if you're a money launderer.
 Buying unregistered securities
 Another red flag. In the series, Marty pressures an unsuspecting local to fork over more than $900,000 for an unspecified ""fund.""  While selling unregistered securities is generally illegal, there are instances where it's permitted to so-called accredited investors, meaning those who have a certain level of assets and are therefore deemed to be ""sophisticated."" Sadly, that's often not the case, making them ripe targets for this type of scam.
 Making investments without any due diligence
 In his rush to spread the drug money around, Marty invests in a failing motel/bar, a strip club and a mortuary, all with predictable bad results. The takeaway for you: Never make an investment that you don't thoroughly understand, be it a business or any other opportunity where money is involved. A 90-page prospectus full of legal jargon Alan Dershowitz couldn't decipher means you probably can't either. Absent a very, very clear understanding of what you're buying and the risks involved, just walk away.

 A 'Netflix tax'? Yes, and it's already a thing in some states   
 5:29  PM ET Thu, 17 Aug 2017 |  00:51 
 Netflix — and tax?
Your monthly bill for Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other streaming entertainment services could go up soon as states such as Illinois try to find ways to offset declining sales taxes and other revenue shortfalls. Chicago, Pennsylvania and Florida have already passed a so-called Netflix tax, and cities such as Pasadena, Calif. have broached the issue.
These taxes can translate to additional fees of less than $1 each month to consumers. But over the months — and tacked onto multiple streaming subscriptions — they might add up to $50 or more each year.
 More from USA Today:Disney plans stand-alone streaming service, pulling films from Netflix in 2019Sweet streams, all these streaming plans, plus Disney, could wind up costing you more
Netflix, consumer tax groups and tech trade organizations have voiced their opposition to such taxes, warning they can be unfair and deter innovation. Some opponents have initiated legal challenges, and at least one state has shelved plans after a court decision. But state and local governments aren't likely to halt fresh efforts as falling pay-TV subscriptions and video rentals mean there's less opportunity to tax cable bills or charge sales tax at the cash register.
""The way, particularly, municipalities rationalize this is, 'Well, we don't have Blockbuster Video anymore. We were charging them tax, that's got replaced by streaming services like Netflix, so for us it's really just replacing one tax with another for the exact same service',"" said Larry Downes, project director of Georgetown University's Center for Business and Public Policy.
Sales tax revenue last year grew less than 1%, after accounting for inflation, and states are facing slow growth into 2018, according to the Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University of New York.
""When you see the sales tax base dwindling like this, it is understandable for lawmakers to get together and say, 'Is there a way that we can expand this?'"" said John Buhl of the Tax Foundation, a non-partisan think tank.
Netflix, which boasts more than 50 million U.S. subscribers, hasn't publicly protested the growth in streaming sales taxes but it warns of attempts to assign utility-type taxes.
""Our view is that it is a dangerous precedent to start taxing Internet apps and websites using laws intended for utilities like water and electricity,"" said spokesman Jonathan Friedland. ""
Amazon and Apple declined to comment; Hulu did not return request for comment.
Where your Netflix is already taxed
States including Alabama, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine and West Virginia have considered taxes on streaming and digital entertainment. Those that have already passed so-called Netflix taxes give a sense of the fees facing consumers.
Chicago amended its 9% amusement tax, originally written to tax concert and sporting event tickets, in 2015 to apply to Netflix and other streaming entertainment, including online game networks. For a typical Netflix or Spotify subscriber with a $9.99 monthly plan, that translates to an additional 90 cents per month or $10.79 for the year.
Pennsylvania in August 2016 expanded its 6% sales tax to include streaming services, as well as downloads of apps, movies, music, games and e-books. So, when Apple or Amazon sells a $13.99 ebook to a Pennsylvania resident, the seller must include an 84 cent tax. The state has collected about $46.9 million in the first 10 months of the tax.
Washington, Florida and North Carolina also tax digital goods.
'A tax on millennials'
Sometimes efforts don't stick.
Kentucky began taxing Netflix in 2015, comparing it to a multichannel video programming service such as traditional pay TV. But the state's tax appeals board nullified the attempt, saying the service was not equivalent to a traditional pay-TV service. That decision was subsequently reaffirmed by the state court.
""States are increasingly looking to raise revenue, but these efforts must be both lawful and not discriminate against any one sector,"" said Dustin Brighton, vice president of state government affairs for the Internet Association.
The Internet Association has yet to publicly oppose streaming taxes, but would do so if the group disagrees with how a tax is levied, Brighton says.
Some new tax efforts would seek voter approval, but many result from adapting current laws to cover streaming services and digital goods. Lawmakers that have fought them say while revenues may be bolstered, they can backfire on local governments.
While in the Pennsylvania House, Republican Mike Regan, now a state senator, voted against the law, despite the state's $1.3 billion deficit. He considered it ""a tax on millennials"" and ""short-sighted"" because it could dissuade companies that might locate in the state.
Taxpayers and legislators voiced opposition last year when the city of Pasadena discussed applying its city utility user taxes on Net-delivered services such as Netflix. In Pasadena, that would have meant a 9% tax.
Legal challengers to streaming taxes say federal law that prohibits a tax on e-commerce that discriminates against onlineproviders means some of these municipal efforts should be halted. Earlier this year, the Entertainment Software Association, an industry trade group representing video game hardware makers and software publishers, filed a suit challenging the Chicago law, citing the Internet Tax Freedom Act.
Internet taxation became an issue two months ago when President Trump tweeted about Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, and The Washington Post, which  Bezos paid $250 million for four years ago, accusing ""The #AmazonWashingtonPost"" of not paying ""internet taxes.""
 @realDonaldTrump: The #
AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!
 There is no ""internet tax"" but Amazon does collect sales taxes on goods it sells online to buyers in 46 states.
Yet state and local governments, wrestling with slipping tax revenues, recognize many digital sales go un-taxed. As retail tax bases shrink and with more consumers buying online and purchasing digital goods, more states are likely to debate a streaming tax.
""We are at the very beginning of a trend where local governments begin evaluating their policy vis á vis digital taxation,"" said Stephen Kranz, an attorney with McDermott Will & Emery, a Washington-based law firm handling the Electronic Software Association's case.

Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix.
 Shonda Rhimes's departure from ABC to produce new shows for Netflix could not have come at a better time to intensify the fears that have been roiling the TV industry for the past several years and that have reached a fever pitch this summer.
Said fears involve the rise of tech industry-backed streaming services to such a high level of status and power that they effectively price everybody else out of the TV-making market. If you subscribe to these fears, the best-case scenario is that ""everybody else,"" a.k.a. the more traditional broadcast and cable networks, becomes a sort of farm system for ""the majors"": Netflix, Amazon, and a handful of other players.
The worst-case scenario is that everybody else goes out of business, unable to compete with Netflix's spending spree, and once Netflix dominates the market, it cuts back on its total number of projects — similar to how the company reduced Blockbuster to ash just in time to shift its focus away from its DVD-by-mail service.
 More from Vox:Spotify is removing white supremacist and neo-Nazi bands from its music library  Trump sure seems slower to call out terrorism when a white supremacist is behind it  Crowds stood in line to turn themselves in for the crime of tearing down a Confederate statue
I should caution upfront that this fear is at least somewhat misguided and probably unlikely to come to pass exactly as industry pessimists worry it might. But it's easy to look at Rhimes's move to Netflix, or  The Walking Dead's Robert Kirkman's move to Amazon(he'd previously produced projects for AMC and Cinemax), and wonder if at least some of those fears about ""everybody else"" aren't already coming to pass.
And yet one big open question remains: Is any of this hypergrowth sustainable?
 Netflix is built atop a mountain of debt. The debt itself isn't unusual — but the size of it has a lot of people worried.
 A recent Los Angeles Times report quantified a specific point that comes up in just about any conversation surrounding the future of the film and TV industries: Netflix is built atop a whole bunch of debt. The report estimated that Netflix's debt is around $20 billion, a stunning total for any one entertainment company.
But it's not uncommon for studios to run a deficit while producing any given project, whether it's a TV show or a film.
For most of television history, the conventional wisdom was that a studio would lose money on a TV show until it was sold into syndication — usually at the end of season four — and the studio could start to recoup its investment. The network that aired the TV show made money off it by selling ad revenue, but it was not necessarily obligated to share that ad revenue with the studio that actually made the show, because the rerun market was considered so lucrative (as long as the show lasted long enough to enter it). Now studios can make their money back more quickly, via selling of international rights, streaming rights, and other forms of ancillary revenue, but running up a debt on early seasons of a TV show is still common.
Movies, meanwhile, are produced and sold before they ever make any money at the box office, which means that even a moderately successful film can lose money if it's not budgeted properly. And studios are frequently accused of  creative accounting, in which they allege that they just barely broke even on hits, in order to avoid further payouts to members of the creative team who may be entitled to a portion of post-release profits.
So there are plenty of ways to lose money in Hollywood — especially when you're building a new studio or entertainment brand. But it still takes a total boondoggle to completely lose your shirt, especially in television, where  a single Friends can keep raking in cash for decades after it leaves the air.
The larger point is that Netflix running up a debt isn't all that odd; indeed, if it were the sole issue here, nobody would bat an eye. Instead, the factor that's spurred so much discussion and consternation is the size of Netflix's debt, and the fact that the company has only recently seemed to show an interest in reining in its spending, by canceling a handful of underperforming shows (only to turn right around and sign blockbuster deals with Shonda Rhimes, among others).
Netflix, like many companies in the tech industry, is funded by venture capital, which allows it to continue spending money in an effort to someday become a stable, profitable corporate monolith. But such an outcome is by no means a guarantee. Placate venture capitalists, and they'll extend what might seem like an infinite line of credit. After all, Amazon famously  didn't turn a profit for most of its first two decades, and it continues to expand the lines of business it enters.
The concern is that if Netflix and Amazon aren't necessarily bound by the need to erase or lower their debt, but more conventional TV networks are, then Netflix and Amazon aren't really building TV networks. Instead, they're building alternate distribution channels that might eventually forgo the existing entertainment industry entirely, in favor of operating within the tech industry. If you look at it this way, as many in show business do, you can see the makings of a battle that isn't between, say, Netflix and HBO, but between two massive industries. And it's easy to see why those who work in TV and film fear that such a conflict could be detrimental to their continued existence.
 Concern over Netflix and other streaming services is exacerbated by the mystery surrounding them
 Viewed through this lens, the frequent, industry-wide calls for Netflix to release its viewership data are thrown into sharper relief. If Netflix is building an entire alternate entertainment industry based largely on its own perceived awesomeness, viewership numbers might puncture that idea. (If the company's viewership numbers were extremely high, releasing them might only serve to further inflate the Netflix bubble — but one can assume that if its viewership numbers were extremely high, Netflix would at least be teasing them in more concrete detail.)
It's also not hard to see the big three streaming services — Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon — as trying to find a way to retrofit themselves into old-fashioned TV networks with alternate distribution models.
Netflix in particular has always centered its original programming on shows it thinks its subscribers will like, based on what they're already watching. Sometimes, that allows the company to find undiscovered, exciting new talent (as with Stranger Things' Duffer brothers), but it mostly results in lots of deals like the Rhimes pact, in which an established talent arrives to offer Netflix a frisson of legitimacy.
It would be one thing if the various streaming services had better track records than conventional TV networks, but all three are comparable to essentially any major network. Netflix might be the home of Stranger Things and Orange Is the New Black, for example — but it's also home to the quickly canceled Girlboss and Gypsy.
The summer has been especially dismal for the streaming services, with majorly hyped releases (like Gypsyor Amazon's The Last Tycoon) sinking and even long-running shows facing uncertain futures. (Hulu's Casual, for instance, is one of the company's signature shows, but it has yet to be renewed for a fourth season.) Both Netflix and Amazon's film slates have similarly struggled, with the former's failing to garner the same kind of hype as its television offerings, even with critically acclaimed films like Okja.
None of this is to suggest that Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon is doing anything wrong. But it does help illustrate why many in the entertainment industry feel as if they're engaged in asymmetrical warfare against an opponent that isn't bound by the same rules. The media consolidation that has pushed more and more networks and studios into the hands of a few corporations still pales in comparison with a service like Amazon, which is specifically builtto offer a consolidated, all-in-one experience. And regulating such all-in-one experiences to break them up into smaller pieces is something the government has shown little taste for since the 1970s.
There are some crocodile tears in play here — in many cases, we're talking about very rich people complaining about other, richer people — but the existential threat that tech industry-backed options pose to more traditional entertainment companies is real. Netflix and Amazon have already reached such a large size and scale that they'll only really become stable if they evolve into massive, globe-spanning mega-corporations that have essentially driven all rivals out of business. And all of those rivals are currently playing catch-up.
 A streaming service in every pot!
 If one side of the sustainability fear is that Netflix and its ilk can't keep running up massive amounts of debt forever, the flip side is that the entertainment industry trying to beat Netflix at its own game may end up being a self-defeating proposition.
You could argue that failing to grasp the importance of streaming — and thus selling off catalog titles to outside streaming services in the early days of streaming video becoming a mainstream entertainment option — is the film and TV industry's version of the music industry failing to notice the rise of Napster. I'm not sure that argument perfectly tracks, but the way so many studios and networks are hurrying to launch their own streaming services (or are promising to do so,  as Disney has) suggests they at least take the idea seriously.
There's no way that consumers will simply keep shelling out for every new streaming service that comes along. That very situation — a growing number of cable channels to subscribe to — led to the sorts of massive cable bundles whose growing bloat and expense led to the rise of cord cutting in the first place. (This is part of why I half-suspect your  local cable company may yet win the streaming revolution.)
Yet if studios balkanize their content on self-owned streaming services, it's hard not to picture something like the cable bundle being the result. Another option might be that streaming subscriptions collapse and the whole industry shifts to a model where everything you want to watch is purchased or rented à la carte. Such a setup would probably be reasonable for many consumers. However, it would also drastically limit the number of projects with financial backing, as well as more artistically adventurous projects that are harder to imagine turning a profit at first blush.
Talk to executives throughout the entertainment industry, or at their streaming competitors, and they'll readily admit to thinking about all of the above. But there's no optimal way out of the massive game of chicken they're all playing with each other.
And that's before  Apple gets involved in streaming TV and film, or before  Google pours more money into original programming on YouTube (a streaming platform that the generation after millennials, who are just beginning to act as entertainment consumers, is very comfortable with using).
At a certain point, if it looks like a bubble and feels like a bubble, then it's probably a bubble. And bubbles can't inflate forever.

 Charts show true power of Netflix   
 7:54  PM ET Tue, 22 Aug 2017 |  01:01 
 On a day where the major averages rallied and the FANG stocks bounced back, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to track how one stock can have huge sway over the broader stock market.
 That's why the ""Mad Money"" host went off the charts to see how Netflix, one-fourth of Cramer's acronym for the stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet, weighs on the rest of the cohort and market.
So Cramer turned to Bob Moreno, the publisher of RightViewTrading.com and Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com, for a closer look at Netflix's power over the Nasdaq 100.
 Moreno likened it to the butterfly effect, a concept created by MIT mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz in the 1960s. 
""You've heard this before: Lorenz noticed that small changes in initial weather calculations could have gigantic effects on the final results,"" Cramer said. ""This is not just about the weather, Watson. It applies to any complex system, including the stock market. In short, small causes can have large effects. Hence the analogy: a butterfly flaps its wings in Asia and that little movement of air ultimately causes a hurricane on the other side of the world.""
In Moreno's eyes, Netflix is that butterfly, and a small flap of its metaphorical wings has a much bigger impact on the overall market.
For example, over the last year, the streaming giant has outperformed the rest of the FANG stocks by far. But in the last month, Netflix has become FANG's worst performer, dragging down Amazon and Alphabet and leaving Facebook as the only stock in the group able to rally.
""As Moreno sees it, the weakness in Netflix has been weighing on the rest of the FANG cohort,"" Cramer said, turning to a chart of the Nasdaq 100 to prove his point.
 Because the Nasdaq 100 is a market-cap weighted index of the 100 largest non-financial companies that trade on the Nasdaq, larger companies have a bigger effect on its trajectory.
So when shares of tech giants like Facebook and Netflix move, the index moves with them. To illustrate the difference, Moreno put the index in a red line on the above chart and an equal-weighted version of the index, where every stock counted the same, in green.
""Moreno points out that the real, market-cap weighted version of this index is about 4 percent higher than the equal-weighted version,"" Cramer said. ""In short, in the past, FANG stocks like Netflix have given the entire index a real boost. But that's what he's concerned about.""
Moreno's worry is that, aside from Tuesday's rally, shares of Netflix, Amazon and Alphabet have been under pressure. If those stocks can pull the Nasdaq up, they can drag it lower, too.
More specifically, if Netflix starts falling, weak-handed investors will increasingly start selling their shares. Moreno is concerned that that selling will extend to the larger technology sector, which comprises some 20 percent of the S&P 500 index.
""Obviously, Netflix alone can't crush the whole market, but you get the point. It could it be the catalyst that starts a chain reaction of selling and sends us all reeling. This is August, stranger things have happened,"" Cramer said.
Going off Netflix's daily chart below, Moreno said that if the stock can stay above its 50-day moving average, it could postpone the weakness in tech he was expecting.
 ""Here's the bottom line: the charts, as interpreted by Moreno, suggest that this market may have gotten ahead of itself,"" Cramer said. ""Sooner or later, he thinks there will be a day of reckoning, and some butterfly is going to take flight and hurt the whole market. It's going to bring down some large-cap stocks. I think Moreno might be too pessimistic, but you know what? After looking at this, I figured no one's ever gotten hurt taking a little off the table and being a little more cautious after a big up day.""

Schumer signed the deal for her Netflix ""Leather Special"" for a reported $11 million, during a year in which she released a memoir and earned an Emmy nomination and a Golden Globe for her roles in ""Inside Amy Schumer"" and ""Trainwreck,"" respectively.

Schumer has faced criticism from those who believe that a fairly new comedian should not be paid the same amount as longtime performers like Chappelle and Rock.

They are legends and 2 of the greatest comics of all time. I would like to say that I have been selling out arenas these last couple years. Something a female comic has never done. That's a big deal to me, especially because I know I do my best every night on stage for the audience and they have a good time. I didn't ask for the same as my friends. I did ask for more than the initial offer. I will continue to work my ass off and be the best performer I can be. The reports of me ""demanding"" or ""insisting"" on equal pay to them aren't a true. #fat #stealsjokes A post shared by @amyschumer on Aug 23, 2017 at 9:45am PDT
 Schumer confirmed that she requested payment beyond the initial amount offered and made it clear that she will not stand for being underpaid.
Emily Martin, General Counsel and Vice President for Workplace Justice at the National Women's Law Center suggest female employees act similarly if they notice they are being underpaid.
""Demonstrating that [your] responsibilities and the workplace skills required, as well as the demands placed on you are in line with your male counterparts proves that your salary matters,"" Martin tells CNBC Make It.
""Focusing on the ways in which the job is equivalent and the skills and demands on the job are equivalent is key to making the case that the compensation needs to be equivalent, too.""

Netflix CEO and founder Reed Hastings
 Bernstein is downplaying the significance of the recent announcement that Disney intends to pull its movies from Netflix. The firm reiterated its overweight rating on the video streaming company's shares, predicting Netflix's international growth will continue to surge. Disney's movies are shown on Netflix in the U.S. and Canada but only in two other countries, Bernstein notes. ""Almost all of Netflix's future growth will come from international … Investors who were already skeptical (or bullish) on int'l growth will remain so – but Disney's U.S. non-renewal should have no effect on that view,"" analyst Todd Juenger wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ""In the U.S., recent news flow has, if anything, made us more bullish."" Juenger reaffirmed his $203 price target for Netflix shares, which is 20 percent higher than Tuesday's closing price. The analyst said Starz' subscriber growth was not affected after the cable network lost its Disney content. ""We believe gaining on-going and future relationships for exclusive content from star creators such as Rhimes/Letterman/Lorre/Kohan, while losing a handful of Disney movies, is a net positive,"" he wrote. As a result, he estimates Netflix's international subscriber base will grow to 220 million by 2030 from 52 million last quarter. ""The only plausible reason this topic has caused such a commotion for NFLX stock (other than a poor understanding of the facts) is the theory that this is just the start of a huge wave of Hollywood studios pulling their content,"" he wrote. ""We don't think they will (Disney isn't, other than a portion movie output), and we don't think it would matter much if they did. It's too late.""

 Wells Fargo raised its rating on Disney shares to outperform from market perform. Disney announced plans last month to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018. ""With Disney's foray into direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming, we can't help but believe the TV ecosystem will soon embark on an accelerated over-the-top (OTT) path,"" analyst Marci Ryvicker wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""Thus, investors may need to start thinking about increasing exposure to those media cos. with solid streaming strategies, such as … Disney."" Disney has underperformed the market this year with its shares down 3 percent in 2017 through Friday, compared with the S&P 500's 11 percent return. Ryvicker raised her price target for Disney to $116 from $109, representing 14 percent upside from Friday's close. Ryvicker said Disney's new entertainment streaming service will replace Netflix as the exclusive site for Disney and Pixar-branded movies when it launches. She also noted the company's valuation of 15 times forward price to earnings was the ""trough"" level where the shares bottomed out during the previous four years. ""We like the entry point for DIS even if we're early. … We view the risk/reward as heavily skewed to the upside,"" she wrote. ""We continue to believe Disney is a premium brand with one of the best management teams in media."" Shares of Disney rose 1 percent in early trading Tuesday.

 ""T-Mobile One"" family plans now include Netflix for free.
 It's T-Mobile's latest move to continue shaking up the wireless industry.
The free Netflix subscription applies to T-Mobile One plans with two or more lines, so customers don't need to sign up for anything else to take advantage of the offer. Keep in mind that T-Mobile limits streaming to DVD quality unless you pay extra, which means you can't really take full advantage of the super sharp display on your smartphone.
 T-Mobile said customers can activate Netflix by calling T-Mobile, visiting the carrier's website or walking into a carrier store beginning on Sept. 12.

36,2017-09-08,Facebook will spend as much as $1 billion on original TV in the next year  Amazon and Netflix pitch cricket in Indian media push  ,"David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook
 The Wall Street Journal reports that Facebook is going into the next year ""willing to spend as much as $1 billion"" on original video content, building out the roster of exclusive TV on its revamped video tab Watch.
In June, the WSJ reported that Facebook was willing to pay up to $3 million per episode for centerpiece shows, and was also interested in original sitcoms with episodic budgets in the six-figures. At the time, VP of media partnerships Nick Grudin told The Verge in an email, ""We're funding these shows directly now, but over time we want to help lots of creators make videos funded through revenue sharing products like Ad Break."" Eventually, Facebook wants to pay nothing for the original shows, instead offering the creators a 45 percent share of their ad revenue.
Even a $1 billion investment is still a fraction of what Facebook's digital competitors, like Netflix ($6 billion in 2017) and Amazon ($4.5 billion) shell out, and WSJ reports that the number could fluctuate based on the success of the first crop of shows. However, it's an aggressive hike from previous investments.
 Last year, Facebook put up $50 million to pay celebrities and brands (including The Verge's parent company Vox Media) to make content for its then-new Live platform. As of April, the company has been touting this as a success, announcing that one in five videos shared on the platform are live-streamed. In May, Facebook announced a new partnership with several media brands — including Vox Media and BuzzFeed— in which it would pay up to $35,000 for episodes of 5- to 10-minute shows that the companies would own and Facebook would get a 45 percent cut of the ad revenue from. The same week, Facebook announced a deal to stream one Major League Baseball game per month. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reportedthat the company was offering ""hundreds of millions"" to music publishers in exchange for the rights to songs in the background of user-generated content.
Facebook's plan is that Watch, and all of the original content it buys for it, will make TV, like everything on its platform, a social experience. Product management leader Daniel Danker said last month, ""You discover videos through your friends. You often find yourself discussing videos with friends. Video has this amazing power to bring people together and build community."" All of Watch's shows have comments enabled and some are incorporated into Facebook Groups.
This news comes a month after WSJ reported that Apple would spend $1 billion on original content in the next year.

Reed Hastings, CEO, Netflix
 Its plot is as Indian as they come, featuring murky dealings behind the razzmatazz of a hugely popular cricket league.
But the drama series ""Inside Edge,"" launched by Amazon to rave reviews in June, is proof of a rising foreign presence in India's fast-growing online entertainment business.
U.S. giants Amazon and Netflix are both ramping up investments, creating expensive new Indian content in the hope of capitalizing on the explosive recent growth in smartphone penetration and data consumption. Yet they face stiff competition from India's established television companies, which are investing in online platforms of their own — and whose executives warn that the U.S. groups will struggle to apply their standard playbook to frugal Indian consumers.
 ""Inside Edge"" was ""certainly more expensive"" than the ""much lower quality"" television shows previously produced in India, says James Farrell, Amazon's head of video content for Asia-Pacific. It is available, along with a suite of international and Indian films, as part of Amazon Prime — the service that also offers perks such as faster delivery of products. Prime membership costs $99 a year in the U.S. — but less than a tenth of that in India, the lowest rate offered in any market, as Amazon tries to lure viewers who could become loyal customers of its broader e-commerce business.
""Now more than half our new customers are coming from the video service . . . and the Amazon universe is pretty fantastic once you get in,"" Farrell says.

The aggressive pricing is part of Amazon's intense expansion drive in India, even at the cost of heavy operating losses for the foreseeable future, after it was relegated to a marginal role in China. The U.S. group has committed $5 billion in funding to its Indian entity, which is in a battle for supremacy with Indian e-commerce unicorn Flipkart. Netflix has also been building its presence in India since launching there in January 2016. This month, it announced plans to film two new Indian drama series: one, like ""Inside Edge,"" focused on cricket and corruption, and a second about a female homicide detective in New Delhi. It had previously bought the exclusive streaming rights to wrestling movie ""Dangal"" and historical epic ""Baahubali 2,"" two recent releases that are the highest-grossing Indian films in history.
But Netflix, which, unlike Amazon, has not slashed its subscription rates, will find India an utterly different proposition to the U.S. and other developed markets, says Sudanshu Vats, chief executive of Viacom18, one of the country's largest television networks.
Netflix's basic monthly subscription charge of $8 represented a huge discount from traditional television pricing in the U.S., Vats notes — but the opposite is true in India, where monthly cable television charges are typically less than half the cheapest Netflix option.
""If they continue to have global pricing in India,"" Netflix might attract a maximum of 3 million subscribers, Vats predicts. ""That's still a very small number in the Indian context; it's scratching the surface. It's a very good business model, but it doesn't scale."" Jessica Lee, Netflix's head of communications for Asia, says that it is targeting ""the top end of the market"" with its pursuit of ""strong, quality titles.""
""At this point, we are keeping pricing fairly consistent across the world ... India is a massive market and there's still a big potential with early adopters, world travelers,"" she says.
While they have attention-grabbing ""marquee shows,"" Netflix and Amazon are unlikely to be able to match the sheer volume of local content offered by in-country rivals, says Uday Shankar, chairman of Star India, which claims 650 million monthly viewers for its 58 television channels.
""We at Star create almost 18,000 hours of content every year,"" he says. ""Clearly that's not a model that [Amazon and Netflix] can sustain very easily.
""Star has rolled out its own digital platform, Hotstar, offering a huge library of films and drama series from the U.S. and India for about $3 a month — as well as a free, advertising-supported service with more limited content.
For now, Hotstar's growth is subsidized by Star's traditional television services, and Shankar sees little chance of the former overtaking the latter in the foreseeable future. Perhaps 1 million to 2 million Indians are currently willing to pay for online content, ""and I struggle to think that number could jump to 20 million or 30 million in the next five years,"" Shankar estimates. Many Indians, he says, are highly conscious of the cost of mobile data usage — meaning that ""they don't even consider YouTube free — because it costs them money for data.""
Data consumption is surging, however, amid a price war in mobile services instigated by Reliance Jio, backed by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani. Jio claims that in the six months since its September launch, it helped drive national mobile data consumption from 200 million gigabytes to 1.2 billion per month, with Jio subscribers alone consuming 1.7 billion hours of video each month.
For some in the industry, the intensifying competition is unalloyed good news. Eros International, a Mumbai-based film distributor, has seen an opportunity to take advantage by pursuing sale talks on its library of more than 3,000 films, at a reported asking price of $1 billion. It has made contact with potential buyers, including Apple, offering the U.S. company an opportunity to expand its catalog of Indian film content, says a person with knowledge of the discussions.
Returns for the mainstream media industry have long been held back by what consultants at Deloitte described in a recent report as ""rampant piracy."" They estimate that the problem costs the sector Rs190 billion ($3 billion) a year, with films downloaded in their millions from websites based mostly in North America. Many Indians prefer to buy pirated content on memory cards from local merchants, to save on data costs.
""Piracy is a big problem, but you have to live with it,"" says Sushilkumar Agrawal, chief executive of film distributor Ultra Media. ""We're not going to go into the street and fight with people, and this is at the bottom of the police's list of priorities.""
Still, Agrawal views the U.S. groups' arrival as an exciting potential source of new funding for Ultra's expansion into production. ""Amazon are paying good money to the content owners — and they're going for new productions, so we have the opportunity to produce more and more content for them,"" he says.
But despite the ever-expanding feast of online video options, he warns, this industry faces a long struggle to build awareness and supersede traditional television, in a heterogeneous developing country of 1.3 billion people.
""Even in Mumbai, some people don't know how to do anything except switching the channel — so forget about connecting a smartphone to the TV,"" he says.

37,2017-09-11,Film executives weigh the pros and cons of selling to Netflix versus Amazon  ,"Kathrin Ziegler | Getty Images
 Netflix and Amazon are racing to expand their original video offerings, and most filmmakers, production houses and distributors say that it's creating new opportunities — and bringing in more money — for their movies. 
 While there are positives for both services, several independent film production houses and distributors told CNBC Netflix and Amazon have distinct advantages that make them a fit for some films more than others. Here's what they said: 
The case for Netflix
 Netflix pays more than other film distributors for movies, according to multiple film executives.  However many films will not be able to go to theaters.  Netflix's targeting abilities could help find more interested viewers for movies. But some say the audience wanes in about two weeks because there is so much content on the service.  
All the sources said Netflix pays more for distribution rights for films than its competitors. In return, most will have to forgo any additional revenue generated from being in theaters because most of Netflix's movies are on its platform only. The majority of filmmakers will probably make more money overall if they take the Netflix deal, barring the few films that become blockbuster hits, one production executive said.
But not every film will make its mark in theaters, the executive added. For example, an independent romantic comedy with no well-known actors would probably not last long in theaters nor would it get wide exposure. But that same film may have more exposure to a larger audience on Netflix.
In addition, Netflix's algorithms help target users based on taste and could theoretically get the film directly in front of interested viewers for weeks after it is release. But a couple of executives noted unless a film is a breakout hit, popularity usually wanes after about two weeks because of the volume of content being added to Netflix. Still because of Netflix's huge subscriber base, it could mean the movie gets more views than it would have if it only ran in theaters. 
The case for Amazon
 Amazon is more open to letting its films debut or run in movie theaters than Netflix, according to film executives.  The company currently has a better reputation for marketing movies that have awards buzz.  However Netflix is hiring independent film industry veterans to help with marketing efforts and is allowing more theatrical releases for films with award potential, though not before they debut on its platform.  
Amazon does consistently offer one thing that filmmakers want: A theatrical run. Although it may not make financial sense in some cases, most filmmakers want to see their films in theaters. 
Theatrical releases are especially important for films short-listed to win awards. Amazon currently has the most liberal policy and reputation for allowing theatrical releases, even allowing films to premiere in theaters before heading to its service, sources said. However Netflix is increasingly allowing critically-acclaimed films to have a limited theatrical release. 
To win Oscars and other awards, a film needs a strong marketing team and plan to get the movie in front of the right people. Currently, the general consensus is that Amazon knows how to run an Oscar marketing campaign, and will put the money behind worthy films. Last year it took home Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language film ""The Salesman,"" as well as Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor for ""Manchester by the Sea.""  Its film division is led by notable independent film industry veterans Ted Hope and Bob Berney.
One source noted that Netflix is still seen as more of a technology-first company, rather than a media company. An executive noted Netflix has a reputation for putting more marketing dollars behind its fully-owned properties, not those it purchased from other production companies. 
However Netflix has been hiring experienced film execs to convince production companies their films will have competitive distribution and marketing, including bringing former vice chairman Scott Stuber on board in March. It also garnered some Oscar nominations last year for ""13th"" and won the 2016 Best Documentary (Short Subject) for ""The White Helmets."" 
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. Netflix declined to comment.

Julian H. Robertson Jr. speaking at the 2017 Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Sept. 12, 2017.
 Despite voicing concern over a growing stock market bubble, hedge fund legend Julian Robertson Jr. believes that large-cap technology companies including Facebook and Netflix are ""tempting.""
 ""Right now, the Apples, the Facebooks, the Googles, those great growth companies are priced  cheaper than they would have ever been in the '60s, '70s and '80s,"" said Robertson. ""I don't think a lot of people realize that."" 
The Tiger Management founder made the comment Tuesday at the Delivering Alpha conference in New York, which is presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor.
 Robertson's remarks turned heads on the heels of his earlier comments that the stock market, which has been posting records over the past few months, may be overvalued and trapped in a bubble. Information technology is currently the best-performing sector in the S&P 500 this year, up a sizable 26 percent since January.
""The market as a whole is quite high on a historical basis,"" he said earlier in the talk. ""I think we need interest rates to appreciate, to go up, because I think we are creating a bubble.""
The S&P 500 rallied 1.1 percent on Monday to close at a record 2,488.11, while also notching its biggest one-day gain since April 24. The Fed and other central banks have intentionally kept rates low in an effort to spur growth after persistent signs of weak inflation.
Though CNBC's Kelly Evans noted that Robertson had been trimming positions in both Facebook and Google, the hedge fund manager defended his interest in large-cap tech.
""[Netflix] is awfully tempting to me because it's run by really good people. And I love it too,"" he confessed to many laughs. ""Does anyone not like Netflix? That's like saying you hate Santa Claus.""

 CBS Chairman and CEO Leslie Moonves said Thursday that Disney's new streaming service will ""probably"" be a success.
 ""Disney has great product, and once again as you look into the universe, Disney said, 'OK, they don't want to be a part of the Netflix universe.' They wanted to do it themselves. It's something we decided to do a few years ago,"" Moonves said in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""
The CBS chief was referring to his company's CBS All Access service, which launched in 2014. It allows users to stream over the internet live TV and NFL games and thousands of CBS shows on-demand.
 ""People are going to choose what they want to watch. People are tired of paying for things they don't want to watch. ...There is a lot of people who want Disney, just like there's a lot of people who want CBS,"" Moonves said.
Disney announced last month it intends to remove its movies from Netflix and instead launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service.
Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC at the time that Disney had a ""good relationship"" with Netflix, but decided to exercise an option to move its content off the platform.
Moonves also spoke about the changing ways people consume media. He said there is ""no question"" that consumers are cutting the cord but the company is adapting and making money.
""When people are cord cutting or they're leaving cable, they're going somewhere. They're not going to thin air. They're buying other services,"" the CBS chief said.
""We're involved with skinny bundles, the ones that are doing smaller packages of 40 channels as well as CBS All Access and Showtime over the top,"" he said.

 Verizon Lowell McAdam: You don't have to give away something of value to sell your service   
 10:58  AM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  01:35 
 Verizon isn't threatened by AT&T snapping up Time Warner because it can negotiate those deals without having to spend billions on another media company,  Chairman and CEO Lowell McAdam said. 
 ""If we wanted to offer something like HBO, we can call (CBS CEO Les Moonves) and get Showtime in a commercial arrangement,"" McAdam said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Thursday. ""I don't need to own the content in order to prove that to customers."" 
AT&T said on Tuesday that it would expand free HBO subscriptions to all of its Unlimited Choice customers, in addition to its Unlimited Plus users. The company agreed to purchase Time Warner for $85 billion in October 2016. Meanwhile, T-Mobile has added free Netflix to family plans.
 Despite all the promises of new bells and whistles, a reputation among consumers for being a reliable network will be more important, McAdam noted. He pointed out that only 2 percent of Verizon's cell sites went down when Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, as opposed to its competitors which lost 75 percent of their networks. 
""I don't know that you have to give away something that has value in order to sell your service,"" McAdam said. ""That's the edges we're going around at this point. ... At the end of the day, customers will buy based on their experience, doing what they need to do, not whether they have Netflix or not."" 
However, Verizon did delve into purchasing media companies when it bought AOL in June 2015 for $4.4 billion, and Yahoo in June 2017 for $4.48 billion. The two acquired companies were merged into a subsidiary called Oath. The integration is still ongoing, and McAdam said he was hopeful the content will ""pull more people to its wireless service and ultimately to our 5G service."" ItsGo90 video service has also allowed Verizon to offer an over-the-top video (OTT), non-cable or satellite service, but he acknowledged that the OTT field is ""very crowded.""
""We may partner with somebody, we may use that, but I'd say from an infrastructure perspective, we've been satisfied with it as a consumer offering,"" he said. 
McAdam also squashed reports the company was considering purchasing Charter, Comcast, Disney and/or CBS. Verizon will instead focus on building out its wireless 5G network, he said. 
""I think Charter has a great company, great business model,"" McAdam said. ""We are very focused on deploying fiber and 5G and that's where we need to put our capital dollars, and buying a cable company and having to reconfigure their network didn't make any sense for us.""
The new network will ""usher in what I think is the fourth industrial revolution in this country,"" he claimed. It would allow for more automation of services like transportation and health care, as well as more entertainment through virtual reality and other gaming advancements, McAdam added.
Executing the new system will cost $18 billion in capital expenditures, but McAdams said expenses won't go up for the ""short term."" The company does have some cost-cutting measures in place including offering lower streaming video qualities on its unlimited data plans, which could cut costs by $10 billion over the next four years. 
""You can give a different quality of video,"" McAdams said. ""Most people on a cellphone can't tell the difference between 480 and 1080p. You give customers that sort of option.""
Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

Reed Hastings, chief executive officer of Netflix, speaks during a news conference in Tokyo on Monday, June 27, 2016.
 Despite Netflix's huge rally this year, a Wall Street firm says the stock will go even higher based on an analysis of Google search data.
 Piper Jaffray told its clients on Monday that the video streaming company could have as much as 42 percent year-over-year gains in its international subscriber base in the third quarter, in line with the consensus estimate. Analyst Michael Olson also predicted that domestic subscriptions will increase 10.9 percent from the third quarter last year, which is higher than the 10.7 percent consensus estimate.
Netflix had 51.9 million domestic members as of the end of June and 52 million international members.
 Olson reiterated his overweight rating on the stock and his price target of $215, which is 18 percent higher than Netflix's Friday closing price.
But the analyst said the analysis of Netflix search trends on Google points to potential domestic growth of 16.2 percent and international growth of 78.3 percent. While the analyst noted that the Google search model is likely ""overstating"" subscription growth potential, ""it is clearly positive from a directional perspective.""
Piper Jaffray's search analysis had a 96 percent correlation with Amazon's retail sales unit growth in the previous 20 quarters.
""We believe Netflix is well positioned to have over 100 million international subscribers by 2020, along with ongoing operating margin expansion as the company spreads content and marketing spend over a growing installed base,"" Olson wrote.
Netflix is one of the market's best-performing stocks, rallying 47.3 percent this year through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 11.7 percent gain.
The analyst detailed several ways Netflix could reach 164 million subscribers worldwide by 2020 — and that excludes business in China.
""Our 2020 year-end subscriber estimate of 164 million worldwide assumes 64 percent domestic and 19 percent international share of broadband subscribers (excludes China from addressable base),"" Olson said. ""While this level of penetration (domestically) is higher than most comparative subscription entertainment products, we believe the content/value ratio offered by Netflix is, and will continue to be, higher than other relevant comparative offerings.""
Last quarter, Netflix crushed Wall Street's estimates, adding 5.2 million total members versus expectations of 3.23 million. Netflix is set to report third-quarter earnings mid-October.

Reed Hastings, Netflix CEO
 Wall Street analyst Mark Mahaney suggests that Netflix is on track to leverage its strong hold in the United States and continue to notch ""material"" penetration in international markets.
 ""Netflix has achieved a level of sustainable scale, growth, and profitability that isn't currently reflected in its stock price,"" wrote Mahaney, of RBC Capital Markets, in Sunday's note. ""In its oldest International markets, it appears [to] be scaling to profitability just as quickly as the U.S. market did.""
Mahaney backed up his bullish report with data from his team's recent internet user survey. The analyst found that a record 49 percent of U.K. respondents watch Netflix for TV or movies, just shy of YouTube's 52 percent and far ahead of Amazon's 32 percent. But consumer satisfaction in the U.K. also notched an all-time high.
 Mahaney reiterated his findings on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley"" on Monday morning.
""The financial markets assume that Netflix can't be as successful in international markets as they have been in the U.S.,"" he said. ""But our survey actually shows higher satisfaction subs outside of the U.S.""
The analyst explained that because many countries outside the U.S. do not have as competitive entertainment markets, Netflix may stand to perform better overseas.
Mahaney reiterated his overweight rating and $210 price target, which represents 15 percent upside from Friday's close. Netflix is one of the market's best-performing stocks, rallying 47 percent this year through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 11.7 percent gain.
In its third survey of Brazilian internet users, RBC Capital Markets found that Netflix is making steady headway in the largest Latin American market.
Akin to forward progress in the U.K., a record high 77 percent of surveyed Brazilians watched Netflix.
""The results were again overwhelmingly positive… So positive that we'd caveat that there is likely sample bias occurring within the results, given that the respondents to this survey are likely active Internet users who are more likely to subscribe to Netflix in the first place,"" cautioned Mahaney.
But to be sure, the analyst sees these Brazil results as an indicator that Netflix could serve as a bellwether for other international markets.
""We believe these results highlight that Netflix's foray into Brazil has met with strong success so far,"" he continued, referring to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings' comments that characterized Brazil as a ""rocket ship.""
""We also believe that this illustrates the potential for Netflix to reach material (~30%) penetration levels in multiple International markets.""

42,2017-09-19,Media companies should track a new metric: How many people are spending 30 minutes a week with them  ,"Kathrin Ziegler | Getty Images
 We are constantly bombarded with stimuli fighting for our attention. So it's not surprising that traditional media is feeling the incursion of the new media for that attention.
 In the last 10 years, Fox's broadcast ratings are down 50% from an average 4.0 rating for its prime-time shows to 2.0 last year. They're not alone.
A decade ago, we didn't have Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, Amazon or Google's YouTube fighting for our attention in a meaningful way. These services have siphoned off our attention from traditional broadcast and cable TV.
 Yet, ironically, this secular decline in TV ratings make attention more valuable than ever. In 1983, the M*A*S*H series finale attracted an average audience of 105.97 million. Advertisers paid up for that, spending (in today's dollars) the equivalent of $1.9 million for a 30 second ad. February's Super Bowl drew 117 million (including streamers) and was able to charge $5.5 million for the same length of ad.
For any media company (old or new) to increase its value over time, I would argue it needs to know its Weekly Attention Score.
 show chapters
 Media giants talk cord-cutting   
 4:32  PM ET Wed, 13 Sept 2017 |  02:33 
 A weekly attention score would answer what percentage of our total viewers watched us at least a half an hour in the last week? Also: is this number going up or down over time?
Last weekend, I sent out several Twitter polls to my followers to get a sense from them on what captures their weekly attention these days.
Twitter polls are inherently unscientific and these only ad a few hundred people responding, which makes them prone to manipulation or bias. However, I still find them interesting. I have 24,000 followers. They tend to be tech-savvy, wealthy, and mostly in the US (at least according to Twitter's analytics). Therefore, I like polling my followers -- assuming I can devise questions that are more fact-based and less open to manipulation -- as an early-warning measurement of interest level today in this group which might sugest where interest levels will go in a few years in the general public. With all that as a caveat, take these poll results with a grain of salt.
Rather than asking my followers how many hours a week they spend watching traditional linear TV versus streaming services, I instead asked a binary question about if they spent at least 30 minutes a week watching the following services. Here is a snapshot of what I got back in response.
I first started by asking about how much time people spend watching broadcast TV.
 https://twitter.com/ericjackson/status/909484747109359616
 I was frankly surprised the numbers were so high, so I added a follow up question about what people were tuning in to broadcast TV for when they were?
 https://twitter.com/ericjackson/status/909489955696758785
 No wonder these networks are spending so much on live sports rights. According to these results, the biggest reason why these networks are still capturing our weekly attention is sports. Interestingly, the second most popular reason is not the primetime show line-up, but the national news. I guess it's not a coincidence that Shonda Rhimes just decamped to Netflix.
I next asked about attention for the grand-daddy of US Pay TV:
 https://twitter.com/ericjackson/status/909484495820279808
 I'm not sure if these results were inflated by the recently completed 7th season of Game of Thrones. I was actually surprised that HBO did as well as it did. Maybe my followers are big fans of Ballers. Regardless, these results are good news for HBO CEO Richard Plepler and HBO's new owner AT&T.
I then turned to interest in basic cable channels.
 https://twitter.com/ericjackson/status/909483854762782720
 https://twitter.com/ericjackson/status/909484912503394305
 https://twitter.com/ericjackson/status/909484623029301248
 Taken together, these last 3 questions demonstrate that basic cable channels are not deriving as much weekly interest as the big networks. That's not surprising. However, we know that the biggest reason why people are tuning in to those networks are sports, and ESPN happens to be the most popular cable channel in this grouping.
TNT is the second most valuable cable channel in terms of what cable and satellite companies pay to the network in affiliate fees (after ESPN), yet there is a enormous gulf in weekly interest in these results between ESPN and TNT. It would be interesting to know how TNT's weekly interest rises or falls during NBA season. It could be yet another data point on the importance of sports.
To me, this suggests most cable and satellite companies will continue to pay up for ESPN. Even if the gap between ESPN's per subscriber affiliate fees and TNT's seems high at first glance, look at the difference between weekly attention according to these results. For the cable/satellite providers, the weekly attention ESPN brings to their service is likely well worth it.
And now for some of the streamers.
 https://twitter.com/ericjackson/status/909485349105209345
 https://twitter.com/ericjackson/status/909485090375389184
 If my followers are the leading edge of what's to come, linear TV's days are numbered. Just look at how much more my followers are spending on weekly consumption of Netflix and YouTube compared to traditional TV ""channels."" It should only continue to go up.
So some conclusions of these unscientific Twitter poll results:
 Live sports and news continue to grab attention. ESPN should be able to continue to attract affiliate and ad revenues even if ratings decline because of the importance to cable/satellite companies as well as advertisers of the large audiences ESPN can attract. The days of prime time TV dramas and comedy shows are probably numbered. All dramas are moving to on-demand streaming rather than appointment viewing. If sports ever did migrate away from the big networks to the class of new digital players like Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon, the networks would be in trouble. Mobile and streaming services like Netflix and Youtube will continue to ride the wave of increasing attention. Specialty channels like HGTV have done well to carve out a unique little niche for themselves. HBO has clearly broken through to command a regular weekly audience. 
Any media company needs to understand its Weekly Attention Score and whether it's trending in the right direction. If you continue to offer something that people want to consume every week, you offer enormous value in this world where everyone is drinking from the firehose of data.

 These high-flying life sciences stocks make Netflix and Amazon look dull   
 11:44  AM ET Wed, 20 Sept 2017 |  00:54 
 The giants of the internet economy are typically cast as the leading fetish objects for growth investors. But compared to the TAMP stocks, FANG looks a bit dull.
 What's TAMP,  you ask? That would be Thermo Fisher Scientific, Agilent, Mettler-Toledo and PerkinElmer, just a few of the seldom-discussed names that have powered the obscure S&P 500's life sciences tools & services subsector to a 41 percent year-to-date gain.
By comparison, FANG – Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet – are up less than 36 percent this year on an equal-weighted basis. 
 The life sciences tools group — which also includes Illumina, Waters and Quintiles IMS — totals more than $170 billion in market value (about equal to the size of Intel). The companies fall within the health-care sector, but they neither discover cures nor deliver care. They provide lab equipment, testing supplies, analytical devices and services to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, as well as some chemical and industrial customers.
Part of their appeal to investors in an aging and slow-growing world: They profit from the volume of new-drug investigations and lab tests, favorable demographics and the total amount of health care delivered globally but they don't have direct regulatory risk from drug-price controls or an Obamacare repeal.
It helps, too, that the companies generally are steady long-term performers that have done many bolt-on acquisitions in their chosen product areas and tend to convert mid-single-digit sales growth into low-double-digit per-share earnings expansion.
A strong and sustained rally in a cluster of stocks will always have a tidy fundamental story behind it, and here's the case for the lab-products names, according to analyst Paul Knight at Janney Montgomery Scott:
""Even with a sector showing strong performance in 2017, the fundamental backdrop for life science tools is becoming a 'Goldilocks' situation. Asia is the largest tools market and growth is in double digits, industrial demand is increasing with robust PMI indicators at seven-year highs, and currency tailwinds are developing.""
S&P 500/Life Sciences Tools & Services versus S&P 500 (YTD)
 Source: FactSet
More drug investigations and approved treatments, of increasing complexity, are expected. The booming field of immunotherapy development is a growth engine in itself, requiring complex material-handling and storage processes.
It all nets out to a dream growth-investor arrangement: Long-lived demographic forces, resistance to the economic cycle, stable business-to-business supply relationships, global distribution, and a ""razors and blades"" recurring-sales model.
The fact that these attributes have propelled such gaudy share-price gains, though, makes it worth asking whether professional investors are crowding into these names to hide from policy or macro threats that might, at some point, fade away.
In the current phase of the bull market, ""reliable growth companies"" that play a middleman role in de facto oligopolies have hogged a lot of the oxygen, at the expense of more cyclical plays, and especially consumer-facing companies whose moats are seen to be drying up.
Retail, media, branded-clothing and packaged-food stocks are suffering, as investors implicitly shun businesses that require consumers to make an active, conscious decision to spend on a product. Internet platforms, payment processors, aerospace, semiconductors and, yes, health-care tools companies have been enriched at their expense.
The result, for the life-sciences supply names, is valuations at the very high end of the stocks' own historical range. The TAMP stocks and their peers are now fetching between 20 and 40 times projected earnings for the coming year, compared to around 18 for the broader market. And, remember, these are companies generally growing not much faster than nominal world GDP, with admittedly attractive profit margins.
Technical analysts tend to love the group, identifying what look like sturdy long-term uptrends, even if some appear a bit stretched in the short term (note that the sector shed 1 percent on Tuesday in a largely flat market).
The risk to investors at these prices for the likes of Mettler-Toledo, PerkinElmer or Illumina is not that the companies stumble or laboratory volumes roll over. The stocks, instead, could be exposed to a change in investor preferences and outlook on the world.
If the bull market sputters, of course, it would not be kind to once-sleepy growth stocks at premium multiples. And if, instead, confidence grows in the economic-growth outlook and central banks do allow interest rates to rise, fewer investors might feel the need to hide in this corner of the health-care sector.
The question is not whether these are good businesses. They are. The riddle is always what assumptions motivated the last buyer of the stock of a fine business, and what price might be too high to pay for one.

46,2017-09-25,Fox’s FX is pulling more of its shows off of rival streaming services and onto its home-grown version  Netflix heads for worst day since November after Fox spooks investors  ,"Source: FX Networks
 If you're on the fence about  paying an extra $6 a month to watch some TV shows without ads, 21st Century Fox would like to make a more persuasive case: It is adding a bunch of additional inventory to its FX+ service.
In narrow terms, that means that FX+ subscribers will now be able to stream some shows the service didn't have when it launched earlier this month, including older seasons of ""The Americans.""
Fox says it now has every season of 31 different original FX productions available on the service. FX+ is available to some pay TV customers — but only in addition to the pay TV packages they're already buying.
 That still doesn't mean FX+ subscribers get everything that's been on FX. Notably absent is ""The People v. O.J. Simpson,"" perhaps FX's most popular show ever, which is currently running on Netflix.
Meanwhile some shows that will run ad-free on FX+ will also run on other platforms, at least for now: You can also watch the first four seasons of ""The Americans"" on Amazon's Prime video service.
Bigger picture:  Fox, like other big studios/networks, has been making noise about reclaiming its old shows from other people — namely, Netflix — and it is starting to do that: If you want to watch old Fox shows, you increasingly have to watch them on Fox properties (or Hulu, partly owned by Fox).
That's definitely a negative for Netflix, which has to spend more money creating its own shows to replace the ones being hoovered back up by their original owners.
And it's hard to argue that it's a positive for viewers, who increasingly have to do more thinking about what streaming service their favorite show is on.
But it may be worth it to the Hollywood guys, if it slows down the erosion of their own value.

 Netflix heads for worst day since November   
 8:51  AM ET Tue, 26 Sept 2017 |  00:59 
 Shares of Netflix dropped more than 4 percent in midday trading Monday after Recode reported 21st Century Fox is adding more inventory to its FX+ streaming service.
 The move spooked investors because it marks another step in big studios reclaiming their old shows from streaming competitors, pushing Netflix stock toward its worst day since November. While Netflix still carries FX's most popular show, ""The People v. O.J. Simpson,"" Fox now has every season of its 31 original FX productions on FX+. 
Confidence among Netflix investors also wobbled on August 9, when Disney announced it will remove its movies from Netflix to launch a direct-to-consumer service in 2019. Likewise, Fox's move now caters to paying TV customers — but only at an additional cost to the TV packages they have already bought.
 CEO Bob Iger told CNBC in August that Disney had a ""good relationship"" with Netflix but decided to exercise an option to move its content off the platform. Movies to be removed include Disney as well as Pixar titles, according to Iger. Netflix said Disney movies will be available through the end of 2018 on its platform. Marvel TV shows will remain.
Fox did not say if or when it would remove its current offerings from Netflix.
Neither Netflix nor Fox were immediately available for comment.

 Discovery Communications CEO David Zaslav: With Scripps deal we'll have over 20% of viewership   
 1:46  PM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  04:04 
 Discovery Communications wants to become the ""sports Netflix"" for the European audience, said CEO David Zaslav.
 ""ESPN is really just in the U.S., so we actually look at ESPN as an opportunity,"" Zaslav told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Tuesday. ""There are sometimes things that we could look at together, because we're all of Europe, which is about 750 million people, and we are the dominant player in sports there.""
Though Discovery is mostly known for its lifestyle channels like Animal Planet and TLC in the U.S., it also owns European sports network EuroSport and exclusive rights across much of the continent. For example its digital EuroSports Player was one of the only ways people could watch the U.S. Open during the tournament's first week in many European markets, said Zaslav, who was attending Vanity Fair's New Establishment Summit in New York.
 Discovery has also worked with Amazon to stream sports content in Germany and the U.K. Although Amazon could potentially become another bidder for rights and drive up prices, Discovery currently has an advantage because it is the only intercontinental sports content rights owner, Zaslav said.
""Amazon is definitely testing the waters,"" Zaslav said. ""For us, it's been a big advantage because they've been able to help us scale up by driving our subscriber base."" 
Discovery is betting big on direct-to-consumer digital services. When the Discovery-Scripps acquisition deal closes early next year, the company will own about 20 percent of cable viewership, according to Zaslav. It will also make the media company number one among U.S. women and African-American demographics, Zaslav said.
Discovery agreed in July to acquire Scripps in a deal worth $11.9 billion.
In order to expand its revenue stream, the company plans to start moving its content to digital services that let consumers pick what they want, Zaslav said.
Discovery shares have dropped 20 percent since the announcement. If the digital strategy pays off, Zaslav is convinced the stock will bounce back.
""Wall Street will get there, I think, if our strategy is correct,"" he said.

 With Netflix planning to spend up to $7 billion next year on content, HBO CEO Richard Plepler is in no hurry to match the company dollar for dollar.
 ""More is not better, only better is better,"" Plepler told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Tuesday. ""It is very hard to create outstanding content, and we think we have a good record of doing that very very well. We're not trying to create the most, we're trying to create excellence across our categories -- and we have more than the resources necessary to do that.""
As more companies like Apple and Facebook step up investments in content, there's increased competition for show and movie rights. HBO is banking on its reputation for quality programming to stand out, Plepler said. The company spent $2 billion on content last year. 
 ""There's a surfeit of content out there,"" he said. ""Some of it is good. Some of it is mediocre. Some is not so good. I think what our brand reflects and has reflected is that when you come inside HBO you will see something that stands for quality.""
Still, Plepler acknowledged that rights are getting more expensive. He also said that original programming isn't the only draw for HBO customers. Movies from the four major Hollywood studios make up 73 percent of all its viewing across TV and its platforms. 
""We're going to spend what we need to spend to spend to make sure we are creating outstanding programming, curating in a way that our brand continues to stand for excellence,"" Plepler said.

 Buy Netflix before earnings: UBS   
 1:42  PM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  00:47 
 Even though Netflix is one of the market's best-performing stocks this year, one Wall Street firm continues to recommend the streaming video giant's shares ahead of its earnings report.
 UBS told its clients the company will report third-quarter subscriber growth above expectations later this month.
""We see upside to third-quarter guidance based on our analysis suggesting subscriber growth momentum has sustained into the third-quarter with broad-based year-over-year improvements across almost all markets,"" wrote UBS analyst Doug Mitchelson. ""Based on the lackluster stock performance this quarter and investor expectations for an in-line quarter, we see near-term upside to shares.""
 Shares of Netflix jumped 3.5 percent Wednesday after the report. The company is slated to report third-quarter earnings results on October 16, according to its website.
The analyst raised his price target on Netflix to $225, which is 26 percent higher than Tuesday's closing price. The old target was $190. UBS also raised its third-quarter estimates on U.S. net additions to 100,000 and international additions to 300,000, pushing total second-half net addition estimates to about 1 million above Wall Street consensus.
Since highs in July, Netflix shares have fallen about 4 percent, a dip Mitchelson attributes to a recent lack of compelling original content compared to last year's third quarter. Netflix remains one of the strongest stocks this year, up 45 percent since January.
""We see 3Q17 as a tougher year-over-year comparison as 1) no ""Stranger Things,"" 2) five fewer dramas, and 3) no apparent new smash hits,"" explained the analyst. But looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Netflix may have more reason to celebrate.
It is set to release ""very strong"" new content, the analyst said, including renewals of popular shows ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" as well as eight new original dramas. Netflix also revealed a new slate of anime originals and made its first acquisition by buying Millarworld, a comic book publishing company responsible for franchises including ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" and ""Wanted.""
The original content is what has ""played a crucial role"" in the company's subscriber growth, he said.
Still, investors may be hesitant to acquire more shares of Netflix with fears of competition looming.
Many have turned to streaming services by rivals Hulu and Amazon, which announced plans to expand its streaming service into India with Italy, Spain and France potentially next, according to an earlier UBS report. News that Disney will be withdrawing key content and launching its own global service also dampened Netflix shares briefly.

 Trader sees more all-time highs for Netflix   
 3:21  PM ET Thu,  5 Oct 2017 |  04:31 
 Netflix hit an all-time high on Thursday, but Todd Gordon says the charts show more records are ahead for shares of the streaming giant.
 The stock surged more than 5 percent on Thursday after an announcement that the company would be increasing the monthly price of its most popular streaming service by 10 percent. That, and the company's typical post-earnings performance, has the technical analyst and TradingAnalysis.com founder betting on an even bigger rally for Netflix.
""Prices are going up on Netflix, and so is the price of the stock,"" the trader said on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""
 Going back to September of last year, Gordon's chart shows that after every earnings report, Netflix has seen a big rally up before a smaller sell-off. And since the stock is currently in a ""rally phase,"" Gordon expects Netflix to see the same big jump on its Oct. 16 earnings report.
 But as much as Gordon is betting on a big surge for Netflix, he also wants to establish a position at which to stop out of his trade if the stock actually falls. He believes that ""support"" is $186.70 for Netflix, as he determines this to be the level from which the stock broke out to new highs Thursday, and therefore sees that as a point to get out of his trade.
 Since he wants to go long on Netflix heading into earnings, Gordon is selling the October monthly 190-strike put and buying the October monthly 185-strike put for a credit of $2.15 per share or $215 per options contract, making that amount the maximum profit if Netflix closes above $190 on October expiration.
If the stock were to close below $185 on October expiration, then Gordon could lose a maximum of $285 on the trade if he doesn't manage to exit at the $186.70 level he previously determined.
With Thursday's rally, Netflix is currently up 57 percent year to date.

 Netflix raising prices by 10% for most popular plan   
 10:34  AM ET Thu,  5 Oct 2017 |  01:08 
 Netflix said on Thursday it is raising the monthly price of some of its streaming plans.
 Shares of Netflix jumped more than 3 percent following the news.
The company's $10/month high-definition plan now costs $11, according to changes reflected on Netflix's subscription page. Netflix's 4K streaming plan, which provides higher-quality content, will cost $14 per month, a $2 increase.
 The changes affect new U.S. members, while existing members will be alerted of the price change on October 19 ahead of their next billing cycle. Netflix said the price change will ""roll out to members over the course of the next several months.""
""From time to time, Netflix plans and pricing are adjusted as we add more exclusive TV shows and movies, introduce new product features and improve the overall Netflix experience to help members find something great to watch even faster,"" the company said in a statement.
Amazon's most basic plan without HD streaming still costs $7.99 per month. Mashable first reported the Netflix price changes, followed by the Associated Press.
Netflix made the decision to increase the price of its plans in an effort to increase margins while it continues to spend billions creating hit original content such as ""House of Cards"" and ""Stranger Things,"" according to the Associated Press.
Netflix hiked the price of its HD streaming plan back in April 2014, from $7.99 to $9.99. Existing consumers were able to hang on to the original $7.99 pricing, but only until May 2016, when everyone was bumped up to the higher price tier. Netflix introduced a new $7.99 non-HD option for folks who wanted to save money.

51,2017-10-06,Jefferies cuts Disney profit estimates on costs to build Netflix competitor  Stocks that will give your portfolio a buzz  Jim Cramer: Netflix shows everything's an umbrella for everything  This chart shows Netflix could go even higher  ,"Adam Jeffery | CNBC 
Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company
 Disney's planned streaming services rival to Netflix will cut into the media giant's profits, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Jefferies reduced its earnings per share estimates for Disney, saying its new strategy will require significant investments.
Disney announced plans in August to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018. 
 The ""moves position Disney to better monetize content on owned platforms, but at the same time bring Disney's future earnings potential into the spotlight. We think Disney can attract millions of paying subs, but there will be earnings per share dilution in the intermediate term,"" Jefferies analyst John Janedis wrote in a note to clients Friday.
""While Disney has less ad exposure than many of its peers, ESPN ratings for its non-live sports programming remains under pressure,"" Janedis said. He noted that advertisements from automakers and drug companies represent about 30 percent of ESPN ad revenue and the outlook for next year is weak.
Janedis reaffirmed his hold rating and lowered his price target for Disney shares to $103 from $110, representing 3 percent upside from Thursday's close.
He predicted that Disney will forgo $600 million in studio content license revenue from Netflix in 2019 and $150 million a year in television content licensing fees during the next three years. He estimates the company will invest an additional $300 million to $400 million per year to launch its new streaming services.
As a result, Janedis lowered his 2018 earnings per share estimate for Disney to $6.43 from $6.65.
Disney shares have underperformed the market this year with its shares down 4 percent in 2017 through Thursday, compared with the S&P 500's 14 percent return.
The media company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shares of Disney are roughly flat in Friday's premarket session after the report.

 Netflix stock is close to topping $200 for first time ever   
 12:38  PM ET Mon,  9 Oct 2017 |  00:41 
 Netflix edged toward $200 per share as the stock's momentum builds from last week's increase on some of its prices for streaming plans.
 The shares hit a record high during trading Friday of $198.92 following the price increase. On Monday, the stock set a fresh intraday record of $199.40 a share, but slipped back to $196.87 at the close.
Netflix raised its prices Thursday on some of its streaming plans. Its $10/month high-definition plan now costs $11 and the 4K streaming plan, which provides higher-quality content, will cost $14 per month, a $2 increase.
 The hike ""comes sooner than expected, but we like that NFLX is taking a very different approach with rapid implementation putting the increase fully in place by December,"" JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth wrote in a note Monday. ""We think there will be minimal negative impact on churn and overall gross adds given content strength and the continued disruption of linear TV.""
The changes affect new U.S. members, while existing members will be alerted of the price change on Oct. 19 ahead of their next billing cycle.
Netflix shares are up more than 59 percent this year through Friday. Anmuth sees the stock going at least 6 percent higher over the next 12 months.
""We believe this is also a positive read-through for 3Q subs as NFLX is more likely to raise prices from a position of strength,"" wrote Anmuth. 
Netflix said the price change will ""roll out to members over the course of the next several months."" The company reports earnings on Oct. 16.

Bob Iger, chairman and CEO of The Walt Disney Co.
 Disney's shift to pay-television and direct-to-consumer video products will weigh on the stock, thanks to a sizable initial investment and a long lead time to get the offering up and running, an analyst said.
 Guggenheim downgraded shares of the media giant and cut its price target, saying investors have unrealistic optimism on content.
Disney unveiled plans for a direct-to-consumer video streaming service during its earnings report in August. CEO Bob Iger explained that Disney would be pulling nearly all of its content from Netflix in the hopes of grabbing a larger piece of the streaming pie. The plan is to introduce it in 2019.
 ""Our updated outlook reflects our increased caution toward pay-TV ecosystem trends and concern that investor expectations for the financial contribution from the company's content cycle are too high,"" wrote Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris on Thursday. ""While we are optimistic that the company's proposed direct-to-consumer video products will create long-term value, we expect the initial investment and long lead time into the launch of the Disney-branded offering will weigh on sentiment over the next 12 months.""
The analyst set his new price target at $105, down from $122. The new target is 7 percent higher than Wednesday's closing price. Shares have fallen nearly 8 percent since the announcement that Disney will pull its content from Netflix. The stock fell 1.64 percent during trade Thursday.

 Investors are underestimating Netflix's ability to charge more for its video streaming service, according to a top Wall Street firm.
 Bernstein reiterated its outperform rating on the company's shares, predicting Netflix will thrive from its recent price increases without any big detrimental effects.
""Looking at the history of past Netflix price increases, the impact on the pace of net sub additions has not been severe, and has been decidedly temporary — and we believe the Netflix service is even stronger and more entrenched now,"" analyst Todd Juenger wrote in a note to clients Thursday. ""We believe this price increase, sooner than expected, shows Netflix management has reason to be confident in their sub trajectory and price inelasticity.""
 Netflix announced last week it is raising prices for some of its subscription plans. The company's $10 per month high-definition plan now costs $11 per month. Its 4K streaming plan, which enables higher resolution video streaming, will cost $14 per month, up from $12 per month.
Juenger raised his price target for Netflix shares to $230 from $203. The new target is 18 percent higher than Wednesday's closing price.
Netflix has raised prices for new subscribers at a 10 percent per year rate since 2014, the analyst noted, and still has been able to increase its U.S. subscriber base to 50 million from 34 million.
""For anyone who still questions whether Netflix has pricing power,"" Juenger wrote in the note, referring to Netflix's ability to gain customers as it is raising prices: ""How many businesses can you name that have done that?""
He predicts the pricing changes will add more than $600 million of incremental cash flow per year to Netflix. Juenger forecasts the company will increase its average revenue per user by 3.8 percent annually going forward.
Netflix shares have rallied 57.5 percent this year through Wednesday, compared with the market's 14.1 percent gain.
Its shares are up 1.4 percent shortly after Thursday's market open.

 Netflix gets its most bullish Wall Street call yet from Goldman Sachs   
 11:06  AM ET Fri, 13 Oct 2017 |  00:42 
 Investors should buy Netflix into its earnings report next week even after its stunning gains this year, according to one top Wall Street firm.
 Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its buy rating and raised its price target for Netflix shares to the highest on Wall Street. It predicted the video streaming giant will post subscriber gains above expectations over the next two quarters.
""We believe consensus subscriber estimates for Netflix ahead of Monday's earnings remain too low, particularly for the quarter, 4Q, and beyond,"" analyst Heath Terry wrote in a note to clients Friday.
 ""As we wrote at the beginning of the year, content remains the primary driver of subscriber growth and engagement (and the pricing power that comes with it).""
After the report, Netflix shares hit an all-time high Friday, briefly passing through $200 for the first time ever. Netflix is slated to report third-quarter earnings on Monday. 
The company announced last week it is raising prices for some of its subscription plans. Its $10 per month high-definition plan now costs $11 per month. Netflix's 4K streaming plan, which enables higher resolution video streaming, will cost $14 per month, up from $12 per month.
Terry raised his forecast for Netflix stock to $235 from $200, representing 20 percent upside from Thursday's close. It is also now the most bullish forecast for the company out of 37 analysts on Wall Street, according to FactSet.
The analyst predicts Netflix will add 13.9 million net subscribers during the second half of 2017 versus the Wall Street consensus of 10.8 million net subscribers. He also estimates the company will reach 130 million international subscribers by 2020 from 52 million at the end of the second-quarter.
""While high expectations, particularly in light of the price increase, could lead to volatility post [earnings] results, we believe upward revisions to consensus estimates will ultimately drive further outperformance,"" he wrote.
JPMorgan also reiterated its overweight rating and raised its price target for Netflix shares to $225 from $210 on Friday.
Netflix shares have rallied 58 percent this year through Thursday, compared with the market's 14 percent gain.

 });Netflix shares hit an all-time high Friday, briefly passing through $200 for the first time ever, an incredible milestone for a video streaming company upending the traditional media industry.
 The catalyst for the most recent surge was multiple top analysts on Wall Street raising their price forecasts for the company this week. But this year's gains have been about the over-the-top leader growing subscribers at an incredible pace.

After jumping as much as 2.5 percent to $200.82, the stock pulled back slightly to $198.75 a share. The company is slated to report third quarter earnings on Monday.
 Netflix hit a number of impressive subscriber milestones this year. In April, it reached 100 million total subscribers just three years after surpassing 50 million. It also revealed in July it now has more than 50 million subscribers in the U.S. and international markets.
The company's shares have outperformed the market and other media names. Netflix stock is up more than 60 percent for the year through Friday morning compared with Disney shares' decline of 7 percent, Time Warner's 5 percent gain, CBS stock's 11 percent drop and the S&P 500's 14 percent return.

Netflix CEO and founder Reed Hastings
 Disclosure: Affiliates controlled by the writer of this column have a long position in Netflix.
 Netflix was trading slightly above $200 a share ahead of its Q3 earnings report on Monday afternoon.
Its market cap is greater than Time Warner's. And Wall Street is excited about its announcement earlier this month that it is  raising its prices on its two higher-priced subscription plans.
 Yet, there's more room for optimism about Netflix's current string of success, and it comes down to assumptions relating to how big it can grow its subscriber base.
At its latest earnings report released in July, Netflix claimed more than 99 million paying subscribers around the world and 50 million in the U.S. alone. The video streaming company will announce the latest numbers in the earnings report, which comes after Monday's closing bell.
Several years ago, analysts thought the U.S. ceiling for Netflix was 30 million subscribers because that's where HBO had hit its upper limit in the past. Netflix proved them wrong.
Could it continue to grow its subs meaningfully from here? I think so.
We used to assess Netflix's sub potential based on the number of U.S. households. Yet, Hulu revealed an interesting detail in its recent Advertising Week presentation in New York: 10 to 15 percent of current users are mobile only, and this segment is growing quickly.
Are these mobile-only subs the cord-cutters? Maybe. In that case, the former cable households are perhaps simply replacing themselves as mobile-only users.
But they also might be additive.
Are people going to subscribe to both the cable ecosystem and Netflix? They already are in big numbers. This is because — even with the recent price hikes — Netflix's cost is relatively small compared to the cable bundle.
There are 117 million U.S. households today, according to Google. That's bigger than the peak of 100 million pay TV subscribers.
Last quarter, if mobile-only subs can actually grow the pie beyond the pay TV ecosystem, it might even be possible for Netflix to rise above 100 million U.S. subs longer term. And that's assuming password-sharing in the same household.
The rise of mobile-only subscribers will be equally strong (if not stronger) internationally. International's footprint is already bigger than the U.S. footprint and so will probably only increase its lead.
So if 100 million is a long-term target for Netflix subs, the international market target is probably a minimum of 150 million. That's a total of 250 million.
Currently Netflix is doing $10.2 billion in annual revenue on 103 million global subs. That works out to about $8.21 per subscriber per month.
Project ahead five years. If it's able to raise prices $1.20 each year and has 250 million subscribers, Netflix will do $42.6 billion in revenue that year, well ahead of $10.2 billion in the past year. If it can be much more efficient on that extra $32 billion a year in revenue instead of the first $10 billion a year, it could do $14 billion in EBITDA in 2022. That's a lot more than the $700 million in EBITDA it has done in the last year.
The bottom line here is that Netflix's sub base has a chance to more than double in the long term. Watch for mobile-only users to be a key part of that growth.

 Very little skepticism about Netflix's quarter: Jim Cramer   
 9:49  AM ET Mon, 16 Oct 2017 |  01:00 
 Netflix should probably be worth way more than its market value, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Monday.
 ""When I look at Netflix and I look at their scalable model, obviously people continue to think, 'How could this company only be valued at $80 billion if it's going to be your worldwide cord cutting play?'"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street.""
Netflix is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings after Monday's close.
 The video streaming giant's shares were up midmorning Monday and earlier in the session hit a record high. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predicted the company will post subscriber gains above expectations.
Cramer said Netflix must show its investors acceleration in both domestic and international subscribers.
""And they may actually be able to do it because — you remember — they put through a price increase,"" the host of CNBC's ""Mad Money"" said.
The company said earlier this month that it was raising the monthly price of some of its streaming plans.
Cramer also said there's ""very little skepticism"" about Netflix's latest quarter. ""Which leads me to believe that it'll either be up really big tonight or it'll be down a little bit and be up really big tomorrow,"" Cramer said.

 Netflix adds 5.3 million subscribers during Q3, beating analyst estimates   
 4:34  PM ET Mon, 16 Oct 2017 |  01:23 
 Netflix continues to grow, adding 5.3 million net subscribers this past quarter.
 And it's willing to spend the money to continue that trajectory, with a new content budget of between $7 billion to $8 billion for next year. The figure is up from the $7 billion figure chief operating officer Ted Sarandos previously said to Variety.
""While we have multi-year deals in place preventing any sudden reduction in content licensing, the long-term trends are clear,"" the company said in a letter to shareholders. ""Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes.""
 Netflix latest earnings report beat analysts' estimates, mostly on the back of its high number of subscription additions. The company reported earnings on Monday after the bell. Shares were up more than 2 percent during after hours trading after earnings posted. 
 Revenue: $2.98 billion vs. $2.97 billion expected Thomson Reuters consensus estimate EPS: 37 cents per share vs. 32 cents per share, adjusted, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Subscriber net ads: 5.3 million versus 4.5 million, according to a Street Account estimate 
The company now has about 109.3 million subscribers globally. Netflix said it added 850,000 subscribers in the U.S., ahead of the 810,000 Street Account estimate for the quarter. It boomed internationally, signing up 4.45 million subscribers versus the 3.69 million Street Account estimate. The subscription additions were up 49 percent year over year.
Analysts projected Netflix would post strong earnings, including a large number of new subscribers despite some subscription plan rate hikes. The stock price hit over $200 for the first time on Friday.
The company also issued guidance for the next quarter. The company also said it will spend $7 billion to $8 billion on content next year, up from the $7 billion. Netflix chief financial officer David Wells said during an earnings call the robust numbers were due to the pricing plan increases, the upcoming slate and the fact Q4 was strong for the company in 2016. 
 Q4 revenue: $3.27 billion versus the $3.15 million Thomson Reuters estimate Q4 EPS: 41 cents per share vs. 33 cents per share, adjusted, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Q4 Subscriber net ads: 6.3 million versus 6.25 million, according to a Street Account estimate 
It will face stiffer competition as more companies enter the streaming space and more media companies decide to pull their content to create their own services. Disney will pull its movies from Netflix in 2019 to launch its own platform. 
However Netflix is hoping it sell media companies on the idea it can bolster audiences for its existing shows. For example, CW's ""Riverdale"" saw 400 percent audience growth from season 1 to season 2 after the show appeared on Netflix's platform between the seasons according to Netflix. 
In addition, as deals run out Netflix is ramping up its own original content, chief content officer Ted Sarandos pointed out on an earnings call. During Q3, Netflix announced it signed showrunner Shonda Rhimes to an exclusive overall deal as well as completed its first acquisition, comic book company Millarworld. 
Next quarter the company will release its first original Italian and German shows, as well as new seasons of ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown."" It will also debut its second David Fincher series ""Mindhunter."" Fincher is an executive producer on ""House of Cards."" In addition, the David Ayer movie ""Bright"" starring Will Smith will be released on the platform in December. Netflix reportedly paid $90 million for the Ayer film, according to Deadline.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on November 22, 2016 in New York City.
 Earnings season kicked off last week with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America releasing their results. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Verizon and Honeywell are among the companies set to report this week.
""This week is important because you've got companies from almost each sector reporting, so you're going to get a good picture"" of Corporate America's health, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
Equities posted slight gains last week, reaching new records and building on their sharp year-to-date gains. The three major indexes are up at least 17 percent in 2017. 
""The support for the market is centered on improving economic conditions worldwide and on growing expectations for tax relief,"" said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, in a note to clients.
""From a flow of funds perspective, tax reform is expected to allow for the return of overseas profits estimated at being more than $2 trillion. The money from overseas could provide capital for stock buybacks,"" Bittles said.
Investors' hopes of corporate tax reform have increased recently after the House passed a $4.1 trillion budget earlier this month. The Senate is expected to vote on the budget this week.
President Donald Trump touted the U.S. stock market on Monday, tweeting: ""Since Election Day on November 8, the Stock Market is up more than 25%, unemployment is at a 17 year low & companies are coming back to U.S.""
He also said in a separate tweet: ""The U.S. has gained more than 5.2 trillion dollars in Stock Market Value since Election Day! Also, record business enthusiasm.""

 The president also talked about drug prices on Monday. Trump said from the White House that prescription drug prices are ""out of control.""
""If you look at the exact, same drug by the exact same company made in the exact same box and sold someplace else, sometimes it's a fraction of what we pay in this country,"" Trump said. 
Trump's remarks sent health-care stocks lower, with the Health Care Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (XLV) sliding 0.5 percent.
""We've seen this movie before,"" said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, noting that Trump has made similar comments in the past. ""I would expect this to be more of a short-term knee-jerk reaction than a material, long-term change in the sector.""

 Netflix well-positioned ahead of earnings: Frost Investment Advisors strategist   
 12:30  PM ET Mon, 16 Oct 2017 |  02:49 
 Analysts are expecting a robust earnings report from Netflix, including healthy subscriber growth. 
 Revenue: $2.97 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate EPS: 32 cents, per a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate 
Netflix is scheduled to report its latest quarterly earnings shortly after the bell on Monday. It is expected to post revenue of $2.97 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate, up 30 percent year over year. Earnings per share are approximated at 32 cents, a growth rate of 166 percent over this time last year.
 Shares in the company topped $200 for the first time Friday. Netflix raised some of its prices earlier this month, including for its high-definition plan and 4K streaming plan. Despite the price increase, analysts believe subscribers will stick with the company and are bullish on its international growth. 
""I think the company has shown a higher ceiling towards continued subscriber growth in the U.S.,"" Frost Investment Advisors analyst AB Mendez told CNBC, adding that he didn't think the price hike would ""move the needle"" in terms of subscription adds this late in the quarter.
""If they were to announce a weaker subscriber guidance (for next quarter), the subscription prices will probably be a blip on the radar,"" he added. 
Goldman Sachs on Friday reiterated its buy rating on Netflix, saying in a report that it expectedthe company to post higher-than-expected subscriber numbers. JPMorgan also increased its 12-month price target on Friday based on higher subscription prices and Netflix's deal to include its service for free with T-Mobile, which will also increase subscriber growth. 
""We think there will only be modest negative impact on churn and overall gross adds given the price increase is happening around a very strong content and favorable seasonal period,"" JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note to investors.
Disney's plan to remove its movies from Netflix starting in 2019 in order to begin its own streaming service will probably have more impact on the company.
However, Netflix plans to temper the loss of content with its own productions. Netflix's chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, told Variety the company plans to spend $7 billion on content next year, up from $6 billion in 2017. It also completed its first acquisition — comic book company Millarworld — in August.
Frost's Mendez pointed out Netflix boasts a 93 percent show renewal rate, compared with traditional linear networks 70 percent. It shows the company does know what consumers want, which will allow it to increase rates and retain customers, he said. 
""They're demonstrating the algorithm (to create content using data) they have put forth to investors is working,"" Mendez said.

 Too much enthusiasm could drive Netflix lower: Jim Cramer   
 9:55  AM ET Tue, 17 Oct 2017 |  02:15 
 Netflix's stock wasn't rising sharply Tuesday because Wall Street analysts are wondering how long the video streaming giant's growth can continue, CNBC's Jim Cramer said.
 There was also ""a little bit too much enthusiasm"" after Monday's closing bell, when Netflix reported earnings that beat forecasts, Cramer said Tuesday on ""Squawk on the Street.""
Shares of Netflix were up slightly Tuesday morning, trading around $203 per share.
 In its earnings statement Monday, Netflix posted revenue that was essentially in line with forecasts, and reported better-than-expected subscriber growth even as competition intensifies in the streaming video content market.
In a post-earnings conference call, CEO Reed Hastings said the company's focus is on ""doing even better content, getting better partnerships, better mobile streaming.""
""The overall unbelievable theme of the analysts — even though they all raise price targets — is how long can this go on?"" Cramer said. ""I point out it can keep going on because it's an $80 billion company that represents the only international TV network worth $100 billion.""
""Let the traders knock it down and long knives be out and then pick it up,"" Cramer added.
Wall Street firm Piper Jaffray reiterated its overweight rating for Netflix on Tuesday and raised its price target on the shares to $240 from $215. Goldman Sachs also increased price its forecast.

 Cramer Remix: The big problem that triggered Netflix’s decline   
 7:07  PM ET Tue, 17 Oct 2017 |  01:06 
 Frankly, CNBC's Jim Cramer was nervous before Netflix reported its quarterly earnings after the bell on Monday because he knew expectations were very high.
 That's why the ""Mad Money"" host was not all that surprised when the stock closed down over $1 on Tuesday, falling to $199.48 from its post-earnings high of $207.
""Here's the issue in a nutshell: when everyone expects the numbers to be phenomenal, it's very difficult to blow people away, no matter how excellent the quarter really is,"" Cramer said. ""And make no mistake, this was an absolutely fabulous quarter. Not perfect, but really, really great with even better guidance.""
 And Wall Street seems to agree despite the stock's tepid reaction to Netflix's estimate-trumping quarter, in which the streaming giant added 5.3 million net subscribers.
""Netflix's stock may have sold off a bit today, but don't take that as an indictment of the quarter,"" Cramer advised. ""Remember, these declines tend not to last very long in this market if the companies behind them are growing like weeds, as this one is, and the analysts who recommended it before will reiterate their buys with raised price targets — in fact, that process has already started. In a few days, buyers will swarm back to the stock, which I believe is worth a lot more than its current market cap because of the vision, the artificial intelligence — they know what you want — and the fact that Netflix is one of the great bargains of our era.""
 Peak Earnings Phooey

Listerine mouthwash bottles move through the production line at the J&J consumer healthcare products plant in Lititz, Pennsylvania.
 With the Dow Jones industrial average surging through the 23,000 level for the first time ever, Cramer offered investors a piece of contrarian food for thought.
""Here's something you never hear from anyone: Maybe stocks are cheaper than we think,"" Cramer said. ""When we see gigantic Dow Jones components jumping like small capitalization stocks, which helped the venerable index trade through 23,000 at one point today ... we do know that something real is afoot.""
Cramer started with the ""household names."" Johnson & Johnson issued a strong earnings report before the opening bell on Tuesday, with pharmaceutical sales up 15 percent.
""That's some amazing, turbo-charged growth,"" Cramer said. ""Yet when you look at Johnson & Johnson's price-to-earnings multiple, which is how we compare companies on an apples-to-apples basis ... this stock sells for just 18 times next year's earnings estimates.""
All in all, Cramer is tired of hearing how expensive stocks are. Thirty years ago this week, in 1987, the market crashed; back then, stocks traded at 29 times earnings. But now, any pullback could be a gift for eager buyers, Cramer said.
""I hear people say, 'But Jim, this is peak earnings.' I say, 'Sure, I'm worried about the pricing of some [sectors]: DRAMs, semis, disk drives, flash memory. But I don't think we're seeing peak numbers from a JNJ,'"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
 Off the Charts: Consumer Staples Struggles

Kraft and Heinz products
 With the indexes breaking records, including the Dow Jones industrial average's all-time high on Tuesday, Cramer wanted to pause and investigate what's not working in this market.
""Even if the greatest bull run in ages is going on, there are losers and there are laggards, and they help define the action as much as the winners do,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""That's why we need to address the left-behind sector that is the consumer staples cohort, an important group that really hasn't participated in the last leg of this rally.""
So Cramer called in technician Ed Posni, managing director of Barchetta Capital Management and Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com, to help him unpack the charts for a better view of the consumer goods group.
 ThoughtSpot CEO Talks Big Data Problems
 Scott Mlyn | CNBC
Ajeet Singh, CEO, ThoughtSpot
 It's no secret that big data is becoming central to almost every industry, but Ajeet Singh, the founder and CEO of private business-intelligence player ThoughtSpot, still sees some obstacles.
""We believe that the future belongs to ease of access of data, and we look at big data not as a visualization problem, but really, as a human scale problem,"" Singh told CNBC in a Tuesday interview with Cramer.
It's easy to use comprehensive tools like Tableau Software's offerings to bring data to the average worker, Singh said, but most companies still require professional help to make sense of the information.
""You still need an expert analyst to build a nice dashboard, and it takes about a week to do that. You need, really, fundamentally built technology that can be used by an average business user, and that is what ThoughtSpot provides,"" Singh, also a co-founder of cloud play Nutanix, told Cramer.
 Time for a Fundex?
 Finally, after listening to some joyful conference calls like the one led by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, Cramer pitched a fun-loving idea.
""Maybe we should have a fun index, an index made up of companies where the executives seem to be enjoying themselves, happy to tell their story on a conference call after earnings,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
From the outspoken, competitor-bashing John Legere to the ugly-sweater-wearing Hastings, CEOs who have fun during their conference calls can have a bigger impact than just inciting some laughter from analysts and listeners, Cramer argued.
""I'm not asking for there to be a suspension of rigor — which is at times the case with Tesla. I'm not asking for 100 percent rigor and no pizazz, which often can be the case with dry subjects like insurance or banking,"" Cramer said. ""I just think a little fun injects confidence into the proceedings, and in a world that lacks confidence, it's nice to hear it in a CEO's voice every now and then. It makes you feel more confident yourself, so if a stock gets hammered, like Netflix was today, you know that you should buy it into weakness.""
 Lightning Round: Getting Bearish on KMI?
 In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
Kinder Morgan Inc.: ""I didn't like what Goldman had to say about Kinder Morgan today. It made me very nervous. I think that there are some concerns there. That Goldman report was very cogent.""
Littelfuse: ""Emerson should go buy these guys. That's how much I like Littelfuse. And, by the way, did I say that I like Emerson? Emerson's on a major breakout here.""

 Wall Street gushes over Netflix   
 12:13  PM ET Tue, 17 Oct 2017 |  00:46 
 Netflix crushed Wall Street forecasts again, adding 5.3 million subscribers in the third quarter compared with expectations for 4.5 million, and the gains were driven by international subscriber growth.
 Analysts said shares of the video streaming giant should continue to advance even as Netflix raises prices and spends money on original movies and series.  
""Netflix is the leader in a category that contains massive multi-year growth potential,"" Piper Jaffray's Michael Olson wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""There will be increasing competition and unforeseen hurdles along the way, but we think Netflix has reached 'escape velocity.'""
 The company's shares have rallied 64 percent this year through Monday versus the S&P 500's 14 percent return. But they were down 0.4 percent in premarket trading on Tuesday morning. Analysts from Piper Jaffray and Goldman Sachs raised their price targets.
Netflix announced on Oct. 5 that it is raising prices for some of its subscription plans. The company's $10-per-month high-definition plan now costs $11 per month. Its 4K streaming plan, which enables higher resolution video streaming, will cost $14 per month, up from $12 per month.
Wall Street is optimistic the recent pricing changes will drive Netflix's earnings higher.
""Netflix is accelerating away from competitors and building pricing power while driving better-than-expected subscriber growth,"" KeyBanc Capital's Andy Hargreaves wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""This combination suggests greater near-term earnings potential and the likelihood for a longer period of above average growth than we previously expected.""
One top analyst also downplayed some investors' concerns over Netflix increasing its spending for original content. The company's hits include ""Stranger Things,"" ""Orange is the New Black,"" ""13 Reasons Why"" and ""House of Cards.""
Netflix revealed on Monday that it will spend $7 billion to $8 billion next year for content versus the previous guidance of $7 billion.
""While the projection for 'many years' of continued cash burn and a premium valuation raises the risk profile, with a widening content moat, a growing distribution ecosystem and expanding addressable base, we believe that Netflix is building an unmatchable global entertainment platform,"" Goldman's Heath Terry wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
In similar fashion, one analyst believes the increased spending for content will eventually lead to rising profitability.
""Proven success in the US and initial int'l markets provides a roadmap to success in new markets, and scale should allow NFLX to leverage content investments and drive margins,"" Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
Piper Jaffray reiterated its overweight rating on Netflix and raised its price target on the shares to $240 from $215. Goldman Sachs also reaffirmed its buy rating and increased its price forecast to $250 from $235. Netflix shares closed at $202.68 on Monday.

 RBC's Mark Mahaney: The two big risks for Netflix   
 10:44  AM ET Tue, 17 Oct 2017 |  01:29 
 The biggest competitive risk to Netflix is Amazon launching a stand-alone streaming service for $7 a month, closely followed tech analyst Mark Mahaney told CNBC on Tuesday.
 ""If (Amazon) really pivots and want to go after Netflix and offer a stand-alone streaming subscription business for $7 a month, that would be Amazon-esque and that would cut at Netflix,"" said Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets' lead internet analyst.
""But I don't think Amazon wants to do that,"" Mahaney said in an interview on ""Squawk on the Street.""
 Amazon's membership program Prime gives customers access to video services. The company also offers a video-only plan, which costs $8.99 per month.
Mahaney spoke after Netflix's stock hit a record high Tuesday. On Monday, it posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue, boosted by stronger-than-expected subscriber growth. 
The company says it now has about 109.3 million subscribers globally.
In a post-earnings conference call, CEO Reed Hastings said the company's focus is on ""doing even better content, getting better partnerships, better mobile streaming.""
Netflix has ""accelerated their (subscriber) adds each and every year"" and it has the opportunity to scale its business internationally ""more than the market realizes,"" Mahaney said.
He added that Disney pulling out its movies won't impact Netflix internationally much. 
""They're able to grow with or without Disney in a lot of international markets,"" Mahaney said.

 Value investor Bill Nygren increases stake in General Electric   
 12:32  PM ET Tue, 17 Oct 2017 |  02:32 
 Bill Nyrgen shared his market views and top stock ideas in an interview on CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" Tuesday.
 The value investor explained he is bullish on Netflix shares even at a seemingly high price-to-earnings valuation multiple because the company has built a strong competitive position.
""We think there is a lot of latent pricing increase availability here,"" he said. ""The moat that Netflix has created is already large and grows as every day goes past.""
 Competitors such as HBO Now charge $15 per month, which is much more expensive than Netflix's pricing even though the company spends more on content.
Netflix announced on Oct. 5 that it is raising prices for some of its subscription plans. The company's $10-per-month high-definition plan now costs $11 per month. The streaming giant reported better than expected third-quarter subscriber gains on Monday. 
Nygren joined Harris Associates, the investment adviser for Oakmark Funds, in 1983. He manages the firm's flagship Oakmark Fund, which has $17.8 billion in assets as of June 2017. His fund has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years and since inception.
He also told CNBC he believes General Electric is due for a turnaround., and said his fund was adding to its position in the shares when they were trading down this year.
General Electric ""within a couple years should be able to earn in the mid $1s [earnings per share] and sell at a premium to the market multiple,"" he said. ""We're owning this because we think they can improve earnings not because of the dividend.""
Nygren admitted any company with a high dividend like General Electric's 4 percent yield has ""risk to the dividend or it wouldn't be priced like that."" 
General Electric shares are down 27 percent year to date through midday Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 14 percent return.
On the general market's valuation, Nygren is not too concerned. He said the S&P 500 is only trading at 15 percent above long term valuation averages compared to the 90 percent premium for 10-year bonds.
""I don't see the excitement typical at market peaks,"" he said. ""We're still finding stocks to buy.""

Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, founders of Snapchat.
 Snap just made a major move to compete with Netflix and Amazon.
 The social media company is partnering with NBCUniversal to create a digital content studio that makes original shows to debut on its Snapchat platform.
NBCUniversal, which already owns a stake in Snap, said it wants to take mobile TV programs ""to the next level.""
 ""As mobile audiences continue to grow, we're excited to expand the type of content we can develop,"" NBCUniversal's Lauren Anderson said Tuesday.
NBCUniversal has appointed Anderson to head the project as chief content officer. The executive, who previously was the broadcaster's senior vice president of primetime programming, developed and oversaw shows such as ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""The Office.""
""By combining the best-in-class creative expertise of NBCUniversal with the broad digital reach of Snapchat, we have the unique ability to take mobile programming to the next level, creating compelling shows for both viewers and advertisers,"" Anderson said.
Donut Studios co-founders Mark and Jay Duplass are also set to join the venture. The brothers are the brains behind HBO's comedy series ""Togetherness"" and the Netflix drama film ""Blue Jay.""

 Tough year for Snap
 Snap's stock price has had a rough year.
After debuting on the New York Stock Exchange in early 2017, Snapchat's parent has faced disappointing earnings results and a decline in users.
Since March, the stock has gone from an all-time high of $29.44 to as low as $13.10 in July. Shares of the Snap were at $16.26 in premarket trading Tuesday.
NBCUniversal, CNBC's parent company, was a participant in Snap's initial public offering, investing $500 million in the U.S.-based start-up.

 NBCUniversal invests $500M in Snap   
 9:51  AM ET Fri,  3 March 2017 |  01:58 
 Last September, Snap launched an initiative called ""Shows"" for its Discover platform, to release mobile TV-like content on Snapchat. The U.S. broadcaster was Snap's first partner for the programming.
Sean Mills, head of original content for Snap, said the company was ""thrilled"" with the closer collaboration with NBCUniversal, and said NBCUniversal has been ""amazing collaborators from the start.""
The move signals entry into a market dominated by firms such as Netflix and Amazon, both of which produce original TV content.
And a Facebook TV platform is on the horizon. Reports last month said the social media giant could spend as much as $1 billion on original TV content.

Netflix Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings.
 While the rest of Wall Street was gushing over Netflix's earnings results on Monday, there were two major analysts on the sidelines, citing concerns about lower profit margins as the video streaming giant spends big on content.
 Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju and Jefferies analyst John Janedis both expressed concerns that much of Netflix's revenue will be offset by mounting content expenses.
Netflix's CFO, David Wells, said Monday that the company could spend up to $8 billion for original content alone.
 On the other hand, both the Credit Suisse and Jefferies analysts agreed that Netflix's recently announced price increases in the United States would be helpful in handling the ""cash burn.""
The company's $10-a-month high-definition plan will now cost $11, according to changes reflected on Netflix's subscription page earlier this month. Netflix's 4K streaming plan, which provides higher-quality content, will cost $14 per month, a $2 increase.
""It does appear that Netflix will roll out to the relevant markets at one time, which does raise our revenue estimates for 2018,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju. ""This is offset by increased content acquisition spend expectations of between $10.9-$12.4b next year ... We remain on the sidelines on balanced risk/reward and maintain our neutral rating.""
Jefferies analyst John Janedis added, ""we expect the business will remain cash flow negative for several years, largely driven by significant cash spend on original programming."" The analyst said spending on original shows will overtake spending on other programming as many rein in licensed content.
Ju cut his 12-month price target on Netflix to $209 from $210, while Janedis raised his target to $190 from $180. Netflix closed at $199.48 on Tuesday: Ju's target is roughly 3 percent higher than its current price while Janedis' target implies a approximate 6 percent decline.
The company's shares have rallied 64 percent this year through Monday versus the S&P 500's 14 percent return. However, shares fell 0.25 percent Tuesday, a morning after the earnings report.
""It's exciting that everyone is trying to make over-the-top television better and better, and I think that is good for all of us,"" said Theodore Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, on Monday. ""We just have to focus on creating content that our members can't live without and get excited about every month.""

Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix
 Netflix is selling $1.6 billion worth of notes as the streaming service continues to expand its content budget, the company said Monday. 
 Proceeds of the sale would be used for general business purposes including content acquisition and development, according to a press release.
The notes will be offered to ""qualified institutional buyers"" and will be subject to negotiations with regard to interest rate and maturity date, the release said. 
 Netflix reported 5.3 million new subscribers during the third quarter and emphasized a long-term push for exclusive, original content in earnings conference calls. 
During the earnings announcement, Netflix said it would spend $7 billion to $8 billion on content in 2018 — tacking on $1 billion to the upper limit of earlier content budget estimates.

59,2017-10-25,Buying the Aramco IPO would be like 'buying Blockbuster in the age of Netflix'  FANG performance in the fourth quarter  ,"Mary Catherine Wellons | CNBC
Amin al-Nasser, Chief Executive of state oil company Saudi Aramco.
 Saudi Arabia's Aramco, the world's largest oil company, said on Monday that it is still on track for its initial public offering in the second half of 2018. It will be listed on the Saudi domestic stock market but where it will be listed overseas is still up in the air.
 Here's why it's a risky bet no matter where the shares are listed.
I am afraid the energy created by dinosaurs is becoming one; oil is a dying commodity. Even Aramco's CEO Amin Nasser admitted as much on CNBC on Monday, noting that his company is doing what it can to ""minimize our carbon footprint.""
 Over 70 percent of every barrel of Aramco crude is used for autos and trucks in one way or another, Mr. Nasser said. About 50 percent is gasoline alone and the rest is used for diesel, motor oil, tires and other car-related products. With a worldwide push to eliminate the internal combustion engine, the demand for oil five years from now will be far less than it is today. That doesn't bode well for Aramco's business model.
 General Motors,  Volvo and  Mercedes have all announced plans to phase out gasoline powered cars. The alternative energy market is growing rapidly as natural gas, wind and solar replace oil. In the U.S. alone, renewable energy sources accounted for 10 percent of total energy consumption and 15 percent of electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
 ""General Motors, Volvo and Mercedes have all announced plans to phase out gasoline powered cars.""
 That number is surely going up as the push for alternatives gains ground.
Already, we are seeing signs of oil's decline. Gasoline demand never rose in this country this year, even though more cars were sold. That tells me that people are buying more efficient cars, using more public transportation or using ride-sharing apps like Uber. Indeed,  millennials are less inclined to buy cars or even get a driver's license.
I would compare buying the Aramco IPO to buying a Blockbuster video franchise in the age of Netflix. The timing is all wrong.
On the financial side, IPO's involve a lot of scrutiny. If I was an investor I'd want to see the bottom line, how the company is spending its money. The Saudis opening their books to outsiders is something I find difficult to comprehend when the Saudi government, which owns 100 percent of the company, is far less transparent than those in the West. I don't believe the Saudi's want to invite that kind of scrutiny, which could put the IPO in a holding pattern despite recent assurances.
On a recent trip to Russia to discuss renewing the OPEC deal—the entourage from the kingdom was a reported 1,200 person affair and the  video of the gold staircase leading from the plane was seen all around the world. As an investor, I'd have to ask myself, ""Is my stock purchase subsidizing that lifestyle?""
For me, Aramco is not a ""buy.""

Kevin Spacey in Netflix's ""House of Cards""
 The upcoming sixth season of ""House of Cards"" will be its final season, a Netflix spokesperson confirmed to CNBC.
 The news of the series conclusion comes a day after allegations of unwanted sexual advances surfaced against lead actor Kevin Spacey. Actor Anthony Rapp told BuzzFeed the Oscar-winning actor made a sexual advance toward him when he was 14 at a party in 1986.
However, sources with knowledge of the situation said the decision to end the series was unrelated to Rapp's allegations and was in fact made some time ago.
 House of Cards' production company, Media Rights Capital, and Netflix issued a statement saying the companies ""are deeply troubled by last night's news concerning Kevin Spacey. In response to last night's revelations, executives from both of our companies arrived in Baltimore this afternoon to meet with our cast and crew to ensure that they continue to feel safe and supported. As previously scheduled, Kevin Spacey is not working on set at this time.""
In response to the allegations made by Rapp, Spacey said he did not remember the incident but apologized to Rapp for his behavior if it occurred.  
 Tweet
 ""House of Cards"" is Netflix's first original series, based on a BBC miniseries and a book by Michael Dobbs. It premiered in February 2013 and has since been nominated for 33 prime-time Emmy Awards.

 Netflix suspended production on ""House of Cards"" as it investigates a sexual assault allegation against the show's lead star Kevin Spacey. 
 ""MRC [Media Rights Capital] and Netflix have decided to suspend production on 'House of Cards' season six, until further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew,""  Netflix and production company Media Rights Capital said in a joint statement.

63,2017-11-06,Netflix is staring at higher content costs as Disney and Fox hold merger talks  Disney-Fox deal just the first round in the battle between Netflix and Disney: Moviepass CEO  Is Disney-Fox deal all about Netflix?  ,"Stephane De Sakutin | AFP | Getty Images
Netflix Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings.
 A Disney-Fox tie-up could make life increasingly difficult and more costly for Netflix.
 CNBC reported on Monday, citing sources familiar with the matter, that 21st Century Fox has been in talks to sell most of the company to Walt Disney. While there's no guarantee that a deal will be finalized, the discussions point to a changing landscape in the media world.
Discovery Communications acquired Scripps Network Interactive in July for almost $12 billion.  Comcast bought Dreamworks last year, and Verizon now owns AOL and Yahoo. AT&T and Time Warner agreed to join forces, though the deal could be blocked by the Department of Justice over anti-trust concerns.
 CBS and Viacom's proposed merger was withdrawn by Shari Redstone, the vice chair of the board for both companies, sources told CNBC in December. 
 With 109.3 million subscribers globally, Netflix has become a massive force in the entertainment industry and eaten into the legacy television and cable businesses. But as giant media companies merge their portfolios and roll out their own on-demand offerings, it's going to be harder for Netflix to compete, said Greg Portell, a partner at management consulting firm A.T. Kearney.

 Is Disney-Fox deal all about Netflix?   
 5:31  PM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  04:33 
 ""If Disney or Comcast or anyone else comes up with something with a similar subscriber profile it will make it that much harder,"" Portell said.
Netflix has already announced plans to spend up to $8 billion on content in 2018. The company's  catalog currently consists of a few buzzy shows, a handful of potential breakout hits and ""a whole lot of clutter,"" Portell points out. Additionally, Netflix has cut ties with ""House of Cards"" star Kevin Spacey following multiple allegations of sexual harassment against the actor.
Everything is getting more expensive. Amazon is producing original content, and Apple and Facebook are also getting into the game. HBO isn't going anywhere, and AMC has its share of hits. Fox, Disney, Comcast and Time Warner are all co-owners of Hulu. 
 No more cheap content
 Whether it's for original content or older shows and movies, consumers have a growing number of alternatives to Netflix's monthly subscription.
""The days of cheap archived content are over,""  said Jim Nail, an analyst at Forrester. Companies are ""going to ask Netflix for a whole lot of money.""
Still, investors are clearly on Netflix's side. The stock has surged 62 percent this year and is trading near a record. Old media companies, meanwhile, are playing defense.
""The mergers are more of a function of the weaker players not being as viable as consumer consumption changes, "" said A.B. Mendez, an analyst at Frost Investment Advisors.

 21st Century Fox sending signal it doesn't have scale to compete: David Faber   
 9:37  AM ET Tue,  7 Nov 2017 |  03:18 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday that a deal between Walt Disney and 21st Century Fox would make ""so much sense"" and could represent a threat to streaming giant Netflix.
 Shares of 21st Century Fox and Disney were higher Tuesday after CNBC reported Monday, citing sources, that Fox has been in talks to sell most of the company to Disney.
CNBC reported Tuesday that Disney approached 21st Century Fox on the deal.
 Officials at Disney and Fox declined to comment.
Fox has ""a fantastic slate, but looks like the slate that Disney would want to have. So, I do think this deal makes so much sense,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""I can't believe they don't take it to the finish line.""
TV content that Disney would want include Fox's long-running sitcom ""The Simpsons"" as well as the popular comedy ""Family Guy,"" Cramer said. 
""Why has Fox not levered 'Simpsons' far more than it has?"" the host of CNBC's ""Mad Money asked. ""I think the answer is because they don't really have a place to put it. But Disney does."" 
Disney also would be interested in capitalizing on Fox's movie franchise, Cramer said. Additionally, a deal could represent a threat to Netflix's dominance, he said. 
""If you get Hulu, which is a household name, suddenly you have something that looks like Netflix,"" Cramer said.
Fox and Disney are among the co-owners of Hulu.
Last year, analysts were talking about ""stopping Amazon,"" Cramer added. ""This year I keep hearing Netflix. This is the way to stop Netflix.""

Amazon, which has been disrupting several industries recently, is up more than 48 percent this year, according to FactSet. Netflix has risen more than 50 percent this year, and last month said it added 5.3 million net subscribers in its past quarter.
 Cuban has previously proclaimed his fondness for Amazon before. In an interview with CNBC earlier this year, he said he thinks the online retail giant ""is the greatest company in the world.""
When asked about other investments he's made, Cuban said, ""cash, Treasurys, municipalities ... stuff that I've had forever"" and private companies ""because I really try to support entrepreneurs.""

 Will Disney's streaming service be able to compete with Netflix?   
 3:53  PM ET Fri, 10 Nov 2017 |  03:45 
 The Walt Disney Company share gained after the company said it plans to price its streaming service ""substantially below"" that of Netflix.
 The company said, however, that its service will be cheaper because it will initially have a smaller library than what the streaming giant offers. Disney said its goal is to attract as many subscribers as possible when it launches the service.
The price tag would be adjusted over time to mirror the volume of content that is added to the service, Disney said during its earnings call.
 As part of a strategic shift, Disney will no longer stream its movies on Netflix starting in 2019 and instead offer them on a new streaming service of its own. The company also intends to launch a separate streaming service for ESPN in 2018.

 Disney earnings miss on top and bottom lines   
 4:20  PM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  01:34 
 The stock initially fell more than 3 percent in extended trade after the company reported year-over-year declines for most of its businesses.
Media networks, the company's biggest segment, saw that figure decline 12 percent year over year. The company said it saw lower advertising revenue at Freeform, ESPN as well as its company-owned television stations.
But longtime CEO Bob Iger reassured investors during the earnings call, saying he believes Disney will be able to tackle current headwinds in the media landscape. 
Here's what each segment reported in operating income compared to StreetAccount consensus estimates:
 Media networks: $1.48 billion, vs. $1.58 billion Parks and resorts: $746 million, vs. $735.1 million Studio: $218 million, vs. $364.4 million Consumer and interactive: $373 million, vs. $470.4 million 
The stock initially fell about 3 percent in after-hours trade, but later reversed to trade 1 percent higher.
Longtime CEO Bob Iger said in a statement that Disney ""will continue to invest for the future and take the smart risks required to deliver shareholder value.""
Earlier this week, CNBC reported that Disney approached 21st Century Fox about acquiring some of its entertainment assets, which would leave the latter with a news and sports-focused business. When asked about the talks in a Thursday earnings call, Disney said it wouldn't take questions on press speculation.
Fox was similarly tight-lipped on the subject. In a Wednesday earnings call, Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch maintained that Fox has the necessary scale to grow and compete in a media landscape that's becoming increasingly digital.
That is a challenge for both Disney and Fox as tech-savvy competitors like Netflix continue to post eye-popping revenue growth. On Thursday, Disney reported a 3 percent year-over-year decline in revenue.
Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:
 EPS: $1.07 vs. $1.12 expected according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $12.78 billion vs. $13.23 billion expected according to Thomson Reuters 
In the year-ago quarter, Disney reported adjusted earnings of $1.10 a share on $13.14 billion in revenue. 
The company has lately suffered a bruising media battle that ended with Disney backtracking on its decision to bar the Los Angeles Times from its movie screenings amid backlash from the news organizations and notable Hollywood figures. Disney had yanked the newspaper's access after it published a two-part investigation that detailed Disney's financial dealings with the city of Anaheim.
Shares of Disney have edged about 0.7 percent lower, year to date.

 Will Disney's streaming service be able to compete with Netflix?   
 3:53  PM ET Fri, 10 Nov 2017 |  03:45 
 The fastest growing FANG stock slowed this week. 
 Netflix — up 64 percent in the last 12 months, outpacing Facebook, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet — shed more than 5 percent this week, as big media players started eyeing the streaming space.  
At Friday close, the stock had fallen to $192.02. 
 ""I think Netflix is in trouble when the big guys start coming after them,"" Needham analyst Laura Martin said. ""Netflix should be scared to death.""
The stock wavered Monday on reports of a possible Disney-21st Century Fox deal that could challenge the streaming service's iron grip on the market, falling just more than a percent. 
Disney CEO Bob Iger took a shot at the streaming service this week, telling investors that over-the-top, direct-to-consumer distribution had become vital to its business and that its own streaming service would be priced ""substantially below"" Netflix. 
All of this comes while Netflix ups its content budget by $1 billion to fund more original programming, even as two stars of Netflix original shows are accused of sexual misconduct. 
Netflix announced in October it would suspend filming of its breakout series ""House of Cards"" following reports that lead Kevin Spacey made a sexual advance at a 14-year-old in the '80s. 
Friday, the company tweeted it would not follow through on production of a stand-up special with comedian Louis C.K. following harassment reports by five women.
To be sure, this week's stock movement was far from earth-shattering. It's still hovering just below all-time highs.

Robert A. Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company, attends the unveiling ceremony of six themed parks of Shanghai Disney Resort at Shanghai Expo Center on July 15, 2015 in Shanghai, China.
 Disney shares are rising Friday as analysts are bullish on its upcoming internet video streaming services, despite the company's earnings miss.
 The media giant reported weaker-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings Thursday. It generated earnings per share of $1.07 versus the $1.12 Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. But analysts got excited after the company said it would price its upcoming streaming service ""substantially below"" Netflix during the earnings conference call.
The stock rose 3 percent Friday morning.
 ""We finally got some glimpse into pricing ... to convert Disney's 'gigantic' customer base into subs – with pricing likely to move higher as more and more content is added,"" Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""Given how just about all of our stocks tend to trade on sub numbers, we view this strategic comment as an incremental positive.""
Disney announced plans in August to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018.
Ryvicker reiterated her outperform rating and $116 price target for Disney shares.
In similar fashion, Goldman Sachs is bullish on Disney's upcoming ESPN streaming offering.
Disney's ""EPS growth is poised to accelerate reflecting a bigger and better film slate (2 Star Wars, 4 Marvel, 2 PIXAR) with ample consumer products opportunities, tailwinds from new attractions (Avatar in Orlando, Toy Story Land in Orlando and Shanghai), and an improving outlook for ESPN driven by benefits from virtual MVPDs and ESPN Plus – the new OTT launching this spring,"" analyst Drew Borst wrote in a note to clients Friday.
Borst reaffirmed his buy rating and raised his price target to $120 from $115 for Disney shares.
Disney has underperformed the market this year with its shares down 1.5 percent in 2017 through Thursday, compared with the S&P 500's 15.5 percent return.
One analyst is also optimistic on the future prospects of other Disney businesses.
""While the quarter largely missed our expectations, looking ahead, we remain upbeat on DIS shares as we head into a strong film slate, growth from recent and upcoming carriage renewals, and continued momentum at the Parks,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers wrote in a note to clients Friday.
""The company remains best positioned in the current fragmented media landscape to leverage its content across a growing number of distribution channels, its own global theme parks and consumer products.""
Meyers reiterated his overweight rating and lowered his price target to $120 from $130 for Disney shares, representing 17 percent upside to Thursday's close.

Jia Yueting, LeEco founder, gestures as he unveils an all-electric battery ""concept"" car called LeSEE during a ceremony in Beijing, China April 20, 2016.
 Jia Yueting, the 44-year-old founder of Chinese tech company LeEco, once envisioned building a Chinese empire that would rival U.S. tech giants Netflix, Tesla and Apple all together.
 With that vision, Jia quickly expanded his company from a video streaming portal to a multinational conglomerate, or a ""sharing ecosystem"" as he called, selling products from televisions to cloud computing; from smartphones to electric vehicles. In January 2016, the company rebranded itself from LeTV to LeEco — short for Le Ecosystem — in order to reflect the founder's global ambition.
It hasn't worked, and instead it turned into a multibillion-dollar quagmire that has rippled through the halls of Chinese power.
 Fall from grace
 In fact, it was Jia's grand ambition — what he and others called a ""sharing ecosystem"" that is ""way far ahead"" — that finally triggered the fall of the the once flamboyant tech icon, former employees and outside experts told CNBC.
The high-flying company was brought down to earth both domestically and internationally, largely because of its heavy reliance on debt to fund an ever-increasing stable of projects, which mostly failed to pan out.
One former LeEco employee, who asked to remain anonymous so as not to damage their reputation, pointed to that gamble when reflecting on the company's struggles.
""Jia's strategies for the company have always been extremely advanced, but those require extreme executions,"" the woman, who previously worked in LeEco's U.S. office, told CNBC.
""It's rare for ordinary companies or employees to execute strategies perfectly, not to mention that the company was experiencing such a rapid expansion,"" she said.
 ""Other companies were all laughing at us.""
-A former LeEco employee
 By the end of 2016, the rapidly expanding firm had become a force of nature with a highly sophisticated structure. Aiming to build a totally integrated ecosystem — that could see proprietary content playing on LeEco apps hosted on a unique digital platform and played through the company's own hardware (ranging from phones to smart cars) — LeEco quickly developed 15 subsidiaries and 68 affiliated parties.
Additionally, while LeEco was still largely unknown to American customers and its services were not widely available until December, 2016, that didn't stop the company from building a stateside presence.
In June, 2016, the company bought 49 acres in Santa Clara from Yahoo and claimed plans to hire 12,000 local employees, aiming at building its global headquarters in Silicon Valley. For comparison, Facebook only houses just over 9,000 employees at its Menlo Park headquarters, while Google employs roughly 20,000 people in the Bay Area, according to reports from earlier this year.
""It's okay to be optimistic, but you can't exaggerate too much,"" said another former LeEco employee, who worked at the company's Hong Kong office last year.
""Other companies were all laughing at us,"" the former employee told CNBC in a phone interview, also requesting anonymity. ""How do you jump from 200 jobs to more than 10,000 jobs by 2018? That's bigger than Facebook!""

 LeEco moves its headquarters closer to Apple   
 3:53  AM ET Sat, 11 June 2016 |  00:38 
 The source said he quit his job last year after feeling disappointed at the company and disheartened about LeEco's future.
""LeEco is a very hierarchical company but the person on top doesn't understand the market besides China. He [Jia] is doing too much but his knowledge set is not that strong,"" said the former Hong Kong-based employee. ""Plus, the talents hired are not strong and not necessarily talented. What can money do? Money does not solve strategy and money can't buy talent.""
But even money slowly became a problem.
While local media outlets in Silicon Valley scrambled to report on the newcomer's aggressive expansion plan in the region, investors back home started to worry about LeEco's financial health.
 Red flags
 Beginning in 2016, domestic Chinese media outlets, along with social media posts on Sina's Weibo and Tencent's WeChat started to point out red flags in the earnings report of LeEco's Shenzhen-listed unit.
That division, Leshi Internet Information & Technology, said in its full-year 2016 report that it had accounts receivable — money owed for goods and services already provided — of 8.68 billion yuan ($1.28 billion), an increase of 5.32 billion yuan ($783.79 million) from the prior year. 
That same year saw revenues jump only 8.93 billion yuan ($1.31 billion), so the increase in accounts receivables made up nearly 60 percent of Leshi's total top-line growth.
Meanwhile, the listed unit was running a negative operating cash flow for 2016 of 1.07 billion yuan ($157.64 million), which was 221.97 percent worse than the prior year's, the company said.
So with surging accounts receivables and plummeting cash flows, LeEco was running out of cash.
 ""I heard people were ringing the bell in the India office. There were ad agencies coming to ask for payment but we didn't have money to pay them.""
-A former LeEco employee
 Beyond that, the soaring value of transactions with parties connected to LeEco also resulted in wide suspicion that Leshi may have been using accounting tricks to report exaggerated sales figures.
In 2016, Leshi reported that sales to affiliated parties reached 11.78 billion yuan ($1.77 billion), representing a 655 percent increase from the prior year while counting for more than half of the company's total revenue.
Fearing the risks of LeEco's cash problems, investors started to flinch by selling off Leshi's stock. By the end of 2016, the company's share prices plummeted by as much as 55 percent from a 2015 record high, and fell an additional 14.3 percent in 2017 before the company requested to halt trading.
""I knew the company might face cash flow problems around July last year [2016],"" recalled the former employee of LeEco's Hong Kong office. ""I heard people were ringing the bell in the India office. There were ad agencies coming to ask for payment but we didn't have money to pay them.""
Reached for comment, a LeEco spokeswoman declined to comment on the claims of mismanagement, suspect accounting and a cash crunch.
 A domino effect
 In late 2016, Jia admitted that the company was facing acute financial troubles. Soon after that, things grew worse for LeEco, leading to a domino effect: The company stopped its electric car manufacturing plant in Nevada; revealed its plan to sell the company's Silicon Valley headquarters and cut hundreds of jobs; and cancelled its purchase of U.S. TV maker Vizio, resulting in the latter filing a $100 million lawsuit over a buyer-termination fee.
Amid mounting negative news about suppliers suing LeEco for nonperforming debts, a Shanghai court ruled on July 3 to freeze 1.24 billion yuan ($182 million) of assets held by the tech conglomerate and Jia due to defaulted payments on a loan to China Merchants Bank.
A few days later, Jia resigned from all his posts, including as the chairman of Leshi, and said he would instead focus on building LeEco's car unit — Faraday Future, a would-be Tesla competitor.
Among headline-making lawsuits and a damaged reputation, Leshi was handed over to an entirely new management team, with Sun Hongbin, the chairman of Chinese property developer Sunac, named the new chairman.
Sunac — highly indebted itself — had invested $2.4 billion in emergency funding to LeEco earlier this year in exchange for shares in the core television and film business.
The downfall of LeEco served as a lesson to Chinese regulators, who recently started to watch closely for the so-called ""sharing ecosystem"" and crack down on suspicious affiliated-party transactions.
 Beijing steps in
 In early October, Chinese newspaper 21st Century Business Herald cited industry sources in Beijing saying that the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had begun to request that listed companies disclose more information and reduce affiliated-party transactions.
According to the newspaper, one source mentioned that CSRC has started to tighten regulation toward tech companies with complicated corporate structures or numerous affiliated parties.
""The risk that LeEco exposed has taught the entire market a lesson, and regulators have already started to look into affiliated-party transactions in the name of the so-called sharing ecosystem,"" the source told 21st Century Business Herald.
Such a trend can be seen from the latest bans ordered by the CSRC, which barred five insurers in early October, including the powerful HNA Group's Bohai Life Insurance, from conducting financial transactions to their parent companies.

Jia Yueting, LeEco founder, poses for a photo in front of a logo of his company in Beijing.
 The CSRC has also tightened the process for approving initial public offerings, requiring stricter accounting standards, capital requirements, and disclosure rules. Data published by the CSRC showed that the IPO approval rate stood at 80.99 percent by the end of the third quarter this year, which was down nearly 10 percentage points year-on-year from 90.96 percent in 2016.
CSRC appears to have even stricter standards in the fourth quarter of the year: The IPO approval rate declined to merely 56 percent since new members of China's Issuance Appraisal Committee took office at the end of September. On Nov. 7, the committee gave the nod to only one out of six IPO applications, setting the lowest daily pass rate since 2015, according to Reuters.
""Regulations over compliance audit have become much stricter recently,"" a source working for a securities brokerage firm in Beijing told CNBC.
""The overall IPO approval rate has fallen to a nearly 10-year low,"" he added, requesting anonymity for professional reasons.
 LeEco's future
 Now, with LeEco still trapped at the center of the storm,
Jia is said to have stayed in the U.S. since his resignation and he has remained relatively silent, leaving debt-holders and LeEco employees back in China wondering where he is and when he will return.
Last month, a Chinese tech news outlet reported that Jia intends to file for bankruptcy for Faraday Future in the U.S. and then sell it to American investors.
LeEco's spokeswoman denied any Faraday Future bankruptcy.
But no matter whether Jia continues to lay low, or he eventually makes a comeback with Faraday Future, one thing is clear: The term ""sharing ecosystem,"" once an emblem for China's global expansion and multinational conglomerates, is now a red flag for Beijing.

68,2017-11-15,"Apple could launch video streaming to rival Netflix while Facebook could do PPV, analysts predict  ","Getty Images 
Tim Cook was the second highest-paid executive of 2016, pulling in $150,036,907
 Apple could launch a video subscription product next year, while Netflix could be forced to introduce new pricing plans, one analyst firm has predicted.
 Tech analysts at CCS Insight released their 12th annual set of predictions about the industry on Wednesday.
One of those is the emergence of an Apple on-demand video service. Original content would feature heavily.
 ""Everyone is jostling for position and everyone is jumping in on the area of video. When you look at Apple, it has a very strong hardware offering and their services business is on the march,"" Paolo Pescatore, vice president of multiplay and media at CCS Insight, told CNBC on the phone.
""The real battleground is in the area of original content, but original content would feature prominent and Apple would be very well placed to do that.""
Software and services is seen as a key growth driver for Apple in the future as smartphone life cycles potentially get longer and as the iPhone-maker looks to monetize is massive user base.
Revenues from services came in at $8.5 billion in the September quarter, growing 34 percent year-on-year.
And video could be a way to boost that further, building off the back of other subscription services like Apple Music.
Apple, the world's largest company by market capitalization, has already dabbled with original content. It acquired rights for ""Carpool Karaoke,"" which debuted on Apple Music this year, for example.
And Chief Executive Tim Cook has also commented on original content, hinting there could be more to come.
""With our toe in the water, we are learning a lot about the original content business, and thinking about ways that we could play in that,"" Cook said in an earnings call in January.
 Netflix new pricing plans
 The changing content landscape could also bring about new moves from the major technology companies, CCS Insight said. The analyst firm is also forecasting that Netflix could introduce new pricing options and services in the quest for new revenue.
Currently, Netflix has three pricing plans in the U.S. that start from $7.99, depending on how many screens a user wants to use the service on and whether he wants shows in higher quality. Netflix recently hiked the price of two of those plans as it continues to fork out billions on content.
With content costs rising and competition in video streaming increasing, Netflix may have to experiment with new options, Pescatore said.
""The prediction is that Netflix gives new pricing options for video to allow people to buy videos or rent them on an a la carte basis. Equally, we expect Netflix to move to other areas and cross-sell games and music into their basis,"" Pescatore told CNBC.
 Facebook PPV
 Social media platforms could also push further into the content game. Facebook has been pushing video on its platform for a while, adding new capabilities such as Facebook Live.
The social network has been involved in bids for sports rights this year and even struck a deal with Fox Sports to stream the UEFA Champions League soccer tournament.
Facebook's interest in sports streaming could see it begin to offer pay-per-view, challenging traditional broadcasters. And with the strength of its targeted advertising, it could be very appealing to sports rights holders.
""The other opportunity for Facebook is even-based advertising. The danger for Facebook, who are moving more into sports, is those premium content owners do not want to give content for free. Facebook cannot rely on advertising alone, but to make the jump in terms of paid content is hard. So Facebook's stepping stone will be showing sport on a pay-per-view basis,"" Pescatore said.

70,2017-11-17,"Big changes are coming to key indices you watch every day  Profits don't matter for investors anymore, only whether a company can beat Amazon or Netflix  ","Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Commuters walk through a Wall Street subway station near the New York Stock Exchange.
 Sweeping changes are coming to several key sectors in the S&P 500 next year, with big names like Amazon and Netflix likely finding a new home.
 The changes don't take effect until September, 2018, but already Wall Street is trying to figure out what big names will will be moved around and which will affect those who own different slices of the S&P 500 through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and many mutual funds.
Late on Wednesday, the S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI jointly announced an overhaul of the Global Industry Classification system, which is how the industry divides the stock market into different sectors. The Telecommunications Services Sector will broaden out to include more internet and media stocks in a beefed-up new sector called Communication Services.
 Many argue the move to expand and rebrand was long overdue.
Traders have often complained that the telecom space is far too small to even be given its own sector. Almost two decades ago, the sector encompassed 14 companies. But after several waves of consolidation, that number has dwindled to just three names - AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink.
 The new Communication Services sector will create two sub-groups:
 Telecom, consisting of telecom, Internet, and wireless services Media & Entertainment, consisting of advertisers, broadcasters, cable/satellite providers, publishers, movie/entertainment 
This makes sense, since many Telecom companies are in the Media & Entertainment business (AT&T owns Direct TV), and internet and wireless services are indeed communication services.
David Blitzer, Chairman of the S&P Dow Jones Index Committee, acknowledged that all these mediums are beginning to intersect: ""The lines among media, communications, and content are blurred,"" Blitzer said. ""It is time to acknowledge this convergence and the overlapping services these companies provide. The Communication Services Sector addresses this progression.""
S&P won't reveal the names until January, but based on the description a lot of companies are going to migrate from Consumer Discretionary to the new Communication Services sector.
 These will likely include:
 Omnicom and Interpublic Group (advertising) News Corp (publishing) Charter, Comcast and Dish Network (cable & satellite) Time Warner, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, and Disney (movies and entertainment) CBS, Discovery and Scripps Networks (broadcasting & cable TV) 
That's a big list! S&P also says that the Internet and Direct Marketing Retail Sub-Industry and ""select"" companies in the Information Technology Sector, will also move into the Communication Services Sector.
This is huge, because it sounds like they want to put the big internet names like Amazon and Netflix, and potentially Google, into the new sector.
""The move corresponds with the changing way we communicate and access entertainment content and other information,"" ETFtrends.com proprietor Tom Lydon told me. ""This would, in turn, impact where investment money goes within the capital markets.""
What's the end result? A big shift in sector weightings. Goldman Sachs, in a note in September, forecast that the current composition of Technology, Consumer Discretionary and Telecommunications Sector would change drastically:
Information Technology
Today: 24.5 percentNew weighting: 18 percent
Consumer Discretionary
Today: 11.9 percentNew weighting: 9 percent
Telecommunication Services
Today: 1.9 percentNew weighting (as Communications Services): 10 percent
Source: Goldman Sachs
Under the new plan, technology would no longer make up a quarter of the overall S&P 500.
With some big names likely migrating out, and with roughly $20 billion indexed to the largest Technology ETF (XLK) and $12 billion indexed to the largest Consumer Discretionary ETF (XLY), you can expect a lot of money to be moved around.

 Retail stocks are surging, here's how they're surviving Amazon's world   
 8:01  PM ET Fri, 17 Nov 2017 |  04:34 
 The stock market is saying internet giants are eating the world and companies need to figure out how to survive their onslaught in the new digital age.
 Amazon and Netflix shares are up 52 percent and 58 percent respectively through Thursday compared to the S&P 500's 15.5 percent gain.
Billionaire John Malone explained why he believes these two technology companies will dominate the future. He is not dismayed by Netflix's guidance of up to $8 billion in content spending next year and multi-billion dollar cash burn. In fact he believes the company's massive investments are essential for its success.  The internet ""makes scale even more important in the media business, where scale always was important. It's all about scale,"" Malone said at the Liberty Media annual investor meeting Thursday.
 Netflix was ""the first wave. And I think Jeff [Bezos] is gonna be the most disruptive. As [his] Death Star moves into striking range of every industry on the planet.""
Some investors have lamented over the sky-high price to earnings multiples for Amazon and Netflix. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn questioned the valuations of the two companies in his letter to clients on Oct. 24. ""Our strategy relies on the assumption that the equity value of a company equals the market's best assessment of the current and future profits discounted at the company's cost of capital,"" Einhorn wrote.
But investors may want to take a longer term view appraising profit streams in this increasingly disruptive world. Companies' near terms earnings are of little consequence, if their businesses get crushed by Amazon or Netflix in a few years.
""The only thing one can be certain about is that things will change and companies will be disrupted,"" Bernstein consumer analyst Ali Dibadj wrote on Nov. 10. Disney's stock price moves following its Nov. 9 fourth quarter results was telling. Initially the shares fell more than 3 percent during the extended hours session after the media giant reported weaker-than-expected earnings versus the Wall Street consensus.
But the company's shares rallied after it revealed plans to price its upcoming streaming service ""substantially below"" Netflix on its conference call. Disney shares traded up 2 percent the following day after the report.
Even though the media company missed its earnings, the market rewarded Disney for its aggressive pricing strategy to achieve scale against Netflix.
Wal-Mart and New York Times represent two other examples of old elephants learning how to dance in the new digital age.
Retail stocks have suffered this year due to competitive pressures from Amazon. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF's declined 8 percent year to date through Thursday, however Wal-Mart shares are up 44 percent.

 Analysts have lauded the world's largest retailer for aggressively investing in its online sales business to compete against Amazon. Wal-Mart acquired e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion in Sept. 2016. ""With a solid foundation in place, Wal-Mart is increasingly playing offense,"" Baird analyst Peter Benedict wrote in a note to clients Thursday. It is ""becoming a powerful omni-channel force.""
New York Times shares are also up handsomely this year. Its shares are 32 percent through Thursday after three consecutive years of mediocre returns.
Even as the media company's print ad sales have plummeted this year, down 20 percent in its most recent quarter, the market is boosting New York Times' stock price for figuring out its digital strategy.
The company's digital subscription revenue surged 44 percent in the nine month period ending in September.

 Malone interview makes Cramer more bullish on Netflix and Amazon   
 7:07  PM ET Mon, 20 Nov 2017 |  01:28 
 It's rare for CNBC's Jim Cramer to see an interview that ""rocks [his] whole investment world,"" but David Faber's interview with Liberty Media Chairman John Malone last week did just that.
 ""Rarely do you come across an executive who's so comfortable in his own skin that he can speak his mind about so many different companies,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Most execs insist they can only speak about their own businesses — they don't want to step on anyone else's toes.""
But Malone isn't one of those executives, and he proved it by drawing the now-pervasive comparison between Amazon and the Death Star, the evil Empire's battle station in the ""Star Wars"" franchise that had the power to destroy entire planets.
 By using scale, reduced cost and heightened convenience to reach consumers, Amazon is moving ""into striking range of every industry on the planet,"" Malone said on Thursday.
Judging by the scramble among pharmacy operators after Amazon expressed interest in entering the drug retail business, Cramer thought Malone was spot-on.
And to Malone, scale — particularly the kind built on artificial intelligence and fueled by the stock market — will propel the success of giants like Amazon and Netflix in the future.
Backed by money from the market and major film studios, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings has developed an international platform that uses AI and price controls to satisfy consumers while giving directors more free will than traditional studios.
""It's a built-in edge that puts Netflix on the path to world domination,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Netflix will beat anyone trying to scale. They've got the directors willing to work for them. And that's why Malone said 'it's way too late' for the cable companies to band together to stop Netflix.""
That got Cramer thinking about Netflix's $83 billion valuation, a far cry from CBS Corporation's $22 billion valuation or Twenty-First Century Fox's $57 billion.
While Cramer could argue that both CBS and Fox still have hidden value that could be unlocked by takeover bids, he was more taken by what Netflix may still have to offer.
""If anything, $83 billion seems too small a valuation for Netflix. Do we really think an international content distribution company with local artificial intelligence and the ability to make its own AI-driven programming should only be worth $83 billion?"" Cramer wondered. ""I could make a compelling case that this worldwide operator ought to be worth a lot more.""
All in all, Malone's comments about Amazon and Netflix (and the echoes that followed) made Cramer even more bullish on the two companies' power to defeat any rival with scale, better information and AI.
""Amazon and Netflix are like Big Brother — they know you better than you know yourself. How can anyone beat that?"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""After watching that interview with Malone, I've gotta tell you that, if anything, I think Netflix's stock is cheap at these levels and I think it can go higher. Maybe much higher.""

72,2017-11-21,"DOJ’s lawsuit to sink AT&T-Time Warner deal is shortsighted in age of Amazon, Netflix  ","show chapters
 Jim Cramer: It drives me 'crazy' DOJ is looking at AT&T deal in a static way   
 7:52  PM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 |  00:31 
 The government is myopic in its argument against the AT&T-Time Warner merger and doesn't comprehend the significant competitive threat from internet disruptors in the digital age.The Justice Department sued on Monday to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner, saying the deal will ""substantially lessen competition, resulting in higher prices and less innovation for millions of Americans.""
 AT&T announced an agreement to acquire Time Warner in October 2016 for a cash and stock deal valued at more than $85 billion.The crux of the government's case is AT&T will be able to leverage the power of Time Warner's content such as HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" and sports programming on TBS to raise pricing or gain subscribers at the expense of its competitors.But the DOJ's complaint fails to mention how AT&T is aggressively pricing its own innovative DirecTV Now internet TV streaming service, which cannibalizes its own satellite TV business. Consumers of the service have already received significant value ranging from free Apple TV boxes to cheaper HBO subscriptions.

DirectTV Now signage in the AT&T Vulture Lounge during the 2017 Vulture Festival at Highline Stages on May 21, 2017 in New York City.
 The internet television streaming service market is also currently booming. Consumers now have more choice and flexibility than ever before. Along with AT&T's DirecTV Now, there are well-funded other offerings such as Google's YouTube TV, Dish Network's Sling TV, Sony's PlayStation Vue and Hulu Live TV in the marketplace. 
 In addition, Disney announced plans in August to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018.
""You could not have a more vibrant competitive landscape than we have today and if anything this merger is going to cause people's cable bills or their TV bills to go down,"" AT&T outside counsel Dan Petrocelli told CNBC on Tuesday.
In fact, AT&T may be pursuing the deal from a position of weakness not strength. CEO Randall Stephenson described the competitive threat from the internet giants during the company's press conference Monday.
 ""Massive large-scale internet companies with market caps in the hundreds of billions of dollars are creating tons of original content and distributing it directly to the consumer. This is disrupting both industries, media and as well as the communications industry."" 
He cited how Netflix has more than 100 million subscribers and Amazon has an estimated 60 million Prime members. In addition, Stephenson noted Google and Facebook are now reaching billions of users.
In comparison the DOJ cited how AT&T has more than 25 million video subscribers across its television services in its lawsuit.
Even legendary cable industry deal-maker John Malone said his industry would not be able to catch up to Netflix due to the company's lead in size and large subscriber base.
The internet ""makes scale even more important in the media business, where scale always was important. It's all about scale,"" he said on Nov. 16. The billionaire investor noted the cable industry missed its opportunity to compete with Netflix in the past and said ""it's way too late"" now.
DOJ also seems to overstate the competitive moat for Time Warner's businesses.
Is ""Game of Thrones"" that different than what Netflix has been able to create with its original content offerings? No.
Does TBS have an irreplaceable advantage in its live sports offerings when Amazon, Facebook and Google are now bidding for the sports broadcasting rights with their massive balance sheets and distribution platforms? No.The government should look at the stock market's verdict on where the power resides and not risk interfering with the free-market's competitive dynamics.
AT&T stock has declined 19 percent year to date through Monday, while Time Warner shares have fallen 9 percent. The S&P 500 is up 15 percent in the same time period.
In contrast, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Netflix shares are up 50 percent, up 55 percent, up 31 percent and up 57 percent, respectively.

 ""The larger the pink circle, the more your investment is worth,"" according to How Much. ""If the pink fits inside the blue, then you lost money. The [graphic] assumes that you took any dividend paid out in cash and did not reinvest into the company by buying more stock.""
These companies largely proved to be good investments. ""All things being equal, prices seem pretty high right now. In fact, most of the companies on our chart have seen significant gains in recent years,"" the report states.
But there are cautionary tales to be seen in the chart, too, since any individual stock can either over- or under-perform. That's why so many experts suggest that, to get started in the stock market, you consider index funds, which hold every stock in an index such as the S&P 500, including big-name companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Google, and offer low turnover rates, so the attendant fees and tax bills tend to be low as well.
Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins all agree index funds are a safe bet, especially for new investors, since they fluctuate with the market, stay pretty constant and eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.
Investing for the first time can be a big step, and it can be risky. Past returns do not predict future results. But if you find the right stocks, it can lead to a real pay off.

76,2017-11-30,Tech's 'FAANG' stocks take a breather during a year of big gains  ,"Damien Meyer | AFP | Getty Images
 It's been a tough week for the FAANG stocks — though a few bounced back today. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet are all down for the week, anywhere from roughly 1 percent to 4 percent.
 That doesn't sound like much, but when you're dealing with this group, you're in the biggest league of them all in terms of market capitalization. When they move, they move indexes, and they can make, and lose, a lot of money for investors. Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon were four of the five biggest negative drags on the S&P 500 this week.
Let me show you what I'm talking about. Collectively, the five FAANG stocks had a market capitalization of about $2.8 trillion at the end of last week. The entire value of the U.S. stock market was about $28 trillion, meaning the FAANG stocks were about 10 percent of the market cap of the entire stock market.
 FAANG vs. the market (market capitalization)
FAANG stocks: $2.8 trillion
U.S. market capitalization $28 trillion
But this week the total market value of the FAANG stocks dropped to about $2.75 trillion, a loss of about $60 billion in market cap. Facebook and Apple alone are down about $17 billion each, followed by Google at nearly $15 billion, and Amazon and Netflix with smaller declines.
FAANG Market cap declines (this week)
Facebook $17.8 billion
Apple $17.7 billion
Google $14.7 billion
Amazon $6.6 billion
Netflix $3.1 billion
Total: $60.0 billion
The good news is that this group stabilized on Thursday. And for the year, they are all up, as much as 56 percent for Amazon and 32 percent for Alphabet. Four have at least doubled and in some cases tripled the S&P 500's 18 percent gain. It will be interesting to see  how much longer can that continue, even with outsized revenue growth.

(L-R) Actors Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Winona Ryder, Millie Bobby Brown, Matthew Modine and Gaten Matarazzo attend the premiere of 'Stranger Things' at Mack Sennett Studios on July 11, 2016 in Los Angeles, California.
 The Stranger Things characters may be fighting monsters from the Upside Down, but things are right-side up for fans of the Netflix series.
Netflix announced Friday that the popular supernatural series would return for a third season. The streaming service's Twitter account first published a poll asking fans if they should make another season of the show, and then followed up with a very declarative tweet.
""FOR THE LOVE OF STEVE, DUH!"" Netflix tweeted, referring to the character played by Joe Keery. ""So hold tight, baby Darts — Season 3 is officially happening.""
 @netflix tweet
 No specific information was given about when the new season would premiere, or which members of the cast would be returning.
The series debuted its second season in late October, which continued the story of Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Will (Noah Schnapp) and the chaos caused by the Upside Down, an alternate dimension endangering the small town of Hawkins, Ind.
Before Season 2 premiered, Matt and Ross Duffer, the series' creators, told USA TODAY that they plan, creatively, for the series to have more than three seasons.

Netflix doesn't release data about viewership, but ratings service Nielsen began its own measurements this year. Nielsen says 15.8 million American viewers watched the first episode of the series' second season by its third day of release.

Comic con fans gather at the Netflix booth at Comic Con International in San Diego, California, July 19, 2017.
 Internet stocks have crushed the market this year and one top Wall Street firm believes the sector can go even higher next year.
 JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth shared his top internet stock ideas in a note to clients Friday.
""Heading into 2018, we expect fundamentals to remain strong in online advertising & eCommerce, with both growing at least in the mid-teens,"" he wrote in the report. ""We are cautiously optimistic, as secular growth & underlying fundamentals should continue to drive strong growth.""
 The average internet stock in JPMorgan's coverage universe has risen 37 percent year to date compared to the S&P 500's 18 percent gain through Thursday.
Here are the analyst's two favorite overweight-rated stock ideas along with his current price targets.
1) Netflix (NFLX)
Anmuth has a $242 Dec. 2018 price target for Netflix shares, representing 29 percent upside to Thursday's close.
""Netflix continues to be our top growth pick into 2018, as we believe NFLX has considerable room to increase its sub base [and its] shares are less well owned relative to the other FANG names,"" he wrote. ""We believe Netflix will continue to drive and benefit from the ongoing disruption of linear TV, supported by an ever-expanding base of high quality original content.""
He predicts Netflix will double its subscriber base to nearly 200 million by 2021.
2) Facebook (FB)
The analyst has a $225 Dec. 2018 price target for Facebook shares, representing 27 percent upside to Thursday's close.
""FB continued to deliver strong ad revenue growth, earnings beats, and significant number revisions in 2017,"" Anmuth wrote. ""We are positive on FB into 2018 … We believe valuation of Facebook shares is compelling at ~21x our 2019 GAAP EPS.""
He is optimistic Facebook has ""significant headroom"" to grow Instagram's 800 million monthly users and monetize the platform.

James Cakmak, Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., says that even though Netflix stock is up 50 percent year to date, it can still go much higher. Video-streaming service Netflix continues to expand its reach. CNBC reports that the company added more than 5 million net subscribers this past quarter, bringing its subscriber base to about 110 million, globally.
 And if you invested in $1,000 in Netflix 10 years ago,  when it first launched its streaming service, that investment would have paid off — and then some.
Financial website How Much, took a look at some popular stocks in 2007 to find out how much a $1,000 investment in each would be worth now. It estimates a $1,000 investment in Netflix in 2007 would be worth $51,966 as of October 31 of this year, or more than 50 times as much. 
 Netflix's performance surpassed that of both Amazon and Apple.

 ""The larger the pink circle, the more your investment is worth,"" according to How Much. ""If the pink fits inside the blue, then you lost money. The [graphic] assumes that you took any dividend paid out in cash and did not reinvest into the company by buying more stock.""
 While Netflix's stock has performed well, though, any individual stock can over- or under-perform. Even though it's up 64 percent just in the last 12 months, some experts advise caution.
Competitors like Disney plan to launch their own streaming services, which would likely pull content, and potentially viewers, from Netflix. ""I think Netflix is in trouble when the big guys start coming after them,"" Laura Martin, an analyst at investment-banking and asset-management firm Needham & Company, said in an interview with CNBC.
Still, many experts, including Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" aren't so bearish. That's due, in part, to Netflix planning to spend $7 to $8 billion on content next year, including for its own new shows, to take on the competition.
The company signed show-runner extraordinaire Shonda Rhimes to an exclusive deal and completed an acquisition with comic book company Millarworld.
 ""Our future largely lies in exclusive original content that drives both excitement around Netflix and enormous viewing satisfaction for our global membership and its wide variety of tastes,"" the company said in a letter to shareholders.
If you're just considering getting into the stock market, begin carefully and remember that past returns do not predict future results. That's why experienced investors like Buffett, Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins suggest you start with index funds.
Index funds hold every stock in an index such as the S&P 500 and offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills. They also fluctuate with the market and eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.

 Netflix, Apple and Facebook won't go much lower   
 8:08  PM ET Tue,  5 Dec 2017 |  00:51 
 After a brutal rotation out of the technology stocks that came on the heels of the Senate passing its tax reform bill, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to check in with tech.
 Tech stocks recovered on Tuesday after Monday's storm of selling, caused in part by investors trying to buy shares of domestic companies that stand to benefit from corporate tax reform.
So Cramer called on technician Carolyn Boroden, one of his colleagues at RealMoney.com and the brain behind FibonacciQueen.com, to help him get a better outlook on the tech sector.
 ""Specifically, we're going to drill down into the action in the now-despised and left-for-dead roadkill that are Facebook, Apple and Netflix,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The big question: when we look back on this moment a year from now, will the pullbacks in these stocks look like fabulous buying opportunities?""
Boroden's methodology for predicting these moves might seem obvious. She uses ratios developed by medieval mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, who discovered that certain patterns repeat themselves in nature in things like snail shells and pine cones.
Funny enough, these patterns also tend to show up in the stock charts. The Fibonacci Queen's specialty is looking at past swings in a given stock or index and applying the ratios to find when a stock might change trajectory.
""I know it sounds like pseudo-science, a kind of stock market astrology or alchemy, but the fact is, it does work,"" Cramer said.
And when it comes to the stocks of Netflix, Apple and Facebook, Boroden found that all three recently reached key Fibonacci extensions of their prior swings.
In plain English, that means the stocks repeated an entire previous move, then ran up some more, which Boroden often takes as a sign to get more cautious.
Looking at the weekly chart of Netflix, Boroden liked that the stock's latest pullback was very similar to its last few declines.
 Netflix's stock lost roughly $27 in its last pullback in late summer. In the pullback before that, it also shed about $27. Last week, it lost $26, meaning the most recent decline could be over.
Better yet, the $27 declines were followed by much bigger rallies that made up for the declines and then some. While that might not necessarily happen again, Boroden was confident that if Netflix's $177 to $178 floor of support holds, the stock could run to $211 a share.
""However, if Netflix does start falling again and breaks down below the floor of support, the next one is at $167 to $168 — that's the level to watch if the big tech sell-off picks up again,"" Cramer said.
Just like with Netflix, Apple's weekly chart suggests the stock is experiencing a ""garden-variety pullback,"" Cramer said.
 Apple's last few pullbacks each lasted for about $14, meaning the now-$170 stock could decline to $160. But the stock has so many floors of support between $170 and $160 that Boroden isn't worried.
""There's the floor at $166 to $167, another floor at $164 and $165, and there's one at $159 to $161,"" Cramer said. ""That's a lot of areas where things could turn again, and the stock's rallied slightly today so it's possible that the pain is already over.""
Like the others, Facebook's last few pullbacks of $10 or $11 suggested that the stock's current decline — down over $10 from where it traded a week ago — might be done after today's rally.
 That said, Boroden did point out some levels to watch for Facebook: one floor of support from $169 to $170, another from $162 to $166, and a third at $157.
""As long as the price holds above one of these floors, even the lowest one, Boroden's optimistic,"" Cramer said.
All in all, Fibonacci ratios, especially when imparted on stocks by the Fibonacci Queen, can be so predictive that they're ""almost creepy,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""The charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, suggest that the recent declines in Netflix, in Apple and in Facebook are really nothing to get too worked up about,"" he concluded. ""My view? These tech titans may not be in the sweet spot to benefit the most from tax reform, but they're still fabulous companies. I'd use any further weakness to gradually buy some more on the way down, even as they've been thrown away as if they were never worth anything to begin with.""

80,2017-12-06,"Apple needs to switch to a subscription model like Netflix to unleash the stock, Bernstein says  ","Fred Dufour | AFP | Getty Images
A Chinese woman reacts while setting up the facial recognition feature on her iPhone X inside an Apple showroom in Beijing on November 3, 2017.
 Apple's stock could ""re-rate"" and tear higher if the company makes a fundamental change to its business and shifts to a monthly subscription model, according to a top Apple analyst, Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein.
 The iPhone maker has historically traded at a relatively low earnings multiple relative to the market as investors see it as a hardware manufacturer.
""We believe that for Apple to trade at a materially higher multiple, it needs to migrate its transactional selling model to a subscription based model,"" wrote Sacconaghi on Tuesday. ""As consumers become increasingly accustomed to paying monthly subscriptions, especially for key 'tech utilities' (e.g. Netflix, Spotify, Microsoft Office 365), we could imagine Apple implementing a subscription plan of its own.""
 Sacconaghi's $195 price target represents 15 percent upside from Tuesday's close; Apple shares closed roughly 0.4 percent lower Wednesday.
While Apple shares are up 46 percent this year through Tuesday's close, iPhone was the tech giant's weakest growing business in the last quarter, contributing just 1.5 percent to the company's overall growth. All other businesses grew double digits, according to the analyst, a sign Apple may want to explore other growth avenues going forward.
Sales of new products and services outside of Apple's core hardware franchise could contribute 260 to 490 basis points of total company revenue growth per year, according to Bernstein research. (A basis point equals 0.01 percent.)
""Customers could lease iPhones, iPads, Macs, and services such as iCloud and Apple Music for one 'low' monthly fee, and have their hardware upgraded after a certain number of years,"" suggested Sacconaghi. ""By moving to a subscription model, Apple would be able to lock in recurring revenue streams and freeze the length of replacement cycles, likely leading to a material re-rating of its stock's multiple.""
To be sure, the analyst also sees tax reform as a positive for Apple's business and a way to raise its multiple. Should Republicans cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent as planned, the company could see an 18 percent boost in reported earnings per share versus a 6 percent lift for technology overall.
""The upshot is that under the new tax reform bill, Apple would enjoy a lower 20 percent U.S. tax rate on its domestic earnings, and also would no longer accrue any U.S. taxes on its offshore earnings,"" concluded Sacconaghi. ""In effect, this would mean that Apple's overall global tax rate could decrease from 25.5 percent to 11.9 percent, resulting in an 18 percent boost to reported EPS.""
Correction: Apple shares fell more than 1 percent in early Wednesday trading. An earlier version misstated the day.

 Netflix breaks down the most popular shows by users' streaming habits   
 11:21  AM ET Tue, 12 Dec 2017 |  00:55 
 Streaming a Netflix show for more than two hours? There's a good chance you're watching ""American Vandal.""
 Netflix released a report Monday that pulls back the curtain on some of the not-so-secret habits of its more than 100 million subscribers worldwide. The entertainment company compiled ""A Year in Bingeing"" by scrubbing through data and some 60,000 surveys to find out just what its users were watching and how.
It split results into four categories, ranking the top 10 in each: shows most watched for more than two hours daily (shows we devoured), shows most watched for fewer than two hours daily (shows we savored), shows users reported watching ahead of a significant other (shows that got us cheating) and shows users gathered with friends and family to watch (shows that brought us together).
 Here are the top performers each category:
 Shows we devoured: ""American Vandal"" Shows we savored: ""The Crown"" Shows that got us cheating: ""Narcos"" Shows that brought us together: ""Stranger Things"" 
And while many of the popular names in Netflix did rank highly on the lists, there was one clear winner.  And, no, it wasn't ""Stranger Things.""
The Netflix adaptation of Jay Asher's novel ""13 Reasons Why"" may not have walked away with a title, but it ranked ranked in the top three of three different categories.

 Disney deal with Fox would be a 'home run' in its battle against Netflix   
 12:29  PM ET Wed, 13 Dec 2017 |  00:48 
 The strategic rationale for Disney buying key media content assets from Twenty-First Century Fox to compete with Netflix is sound, according to one Wall Street firm.
 On Tuesday, CNBC eported that Twenty-First Century Fox and Disney are on a ""glide path"" for a Thursday deal announcement for Fox's movie and television assets. ""With media reports indicating that the Disney/Fox deal looks to have the green light and likely gets announced tomorrow, all eyes will be on Iger & Co. going forward to see what direction Disney strategically takes this 'game changing' $60 billion+ media deal,"" Daniel Ives, GBH Insights' head of technology research, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ""We view this as a home run deal for Disney and while its [sic] an aggressive acquisition with a high price tag, in our opinion this is the right move at the right time as the marriage of these assets creates a much more formidable Disney on both the content and streaming front for the coming years.""
Ives estimates Disney will have a dominant 35 percent to 40 percent market share of U.S. movie box office sales after the deal. He projects the company will be able to save about $2 billion in costs during the first 12 to 18 months after the acquisition.
 Disney will also be in a better position to compete with internet giants with the new assets, according to the analyst. The company announced plans in August to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018.
""We continue to strongly believe the core underlying driver for this deal in our opinion is the impending battle royale for content and streaming services vs. the Netflix machine,"" Ives wrote. ""Disney with this Fox acquisition in its back pocket would create a fiercer landscape for content and thus put itself in a much healthier position to gain market and mind share vs. the likes of technology stalwarts such as Netflix and Amazon when it officially launches in 2019.""
Disney shares are underperforming the market this year. Its shares have rallied 3 percent through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 19 percent gain.

 Disney wants to win the streaming wars by having three distinct products: A family-friendly movie and TV service, a sports streaming platform and an adult-focused Hulu. 
 ""We think it's quite a compelling opportunity for the company, and we think it's really compelling from a consumer perspective,"" Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC's David Faber on ""Squawk on the Street."" 
Disney will purchase many parts of Twenty-First Century Fox for $52.4 billion in stock in a deal announced Thursday. Part of the deal includes Fox's movie studios, networks Nat Geo and FX, Asian pay-TV operator Star TV, and stakes in Sky, Endemol Shine Group and Hulu, as well as several regional sports networks. It will also give it more content to launch its direct-to-consumer services, as it prepares to remove its content from Netflix by 2019. 
 Disney's streaming plans involve launching an over-the-top subscription plan for Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm content in 2019. It will start a sports-focused ESPN streaming service next year, and hopes to make Hulu it's more ""adult-oriented product.""
The Disney-Fox deal will give Disney a 60 percent stake of Hulu. The company things its an ""interesting"" opportunity to grow the platform alongside the other minority owners which include Comcast and Time Warner, Iger said. 
""With that we'll have the ability to direct Hulu in ways that we haven't been able to, as essentially equal partners,"" Iger said. ""But we'll also be able to infuse Hulu with even more content. We will actually invest in content from both entities for Hulu.""

 Fox will need to acquire a studio after Disney deal: David Faber   
 9:32  AM ET Thu, 14 Dec 2017 |  04:13 
 Disney's strategy of buying key media content assets from Twenty-First Century Fox to beef up content for its own streaming services will not work, according to one Wall Street firm.
 On Thursday, Disney announced a deal to acquire certain Twenty-First Century Fox assets including movie studios and cable entertainment properties. 
""We are weighing in - negatively - with our assessment of what we expect will be the strategic rationale for the deal (positioning Disney better to compete in the OTT space) … In our view, Disney is committing significant capital to the lost cause of protecting video aggregation margins,"" analyst Doug Creutz wrote in a note to clients Thursday. ""Taking on competitors who don't need to turn a profit is rarely a good idea.""
 The analyst reaffirmed his market perform rating and $94 price target for Disney shares, representing 13 percent downside to Wednesday's close.
Disney announced plans in August to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018.
Creutz said the internet giants like Amazon and Netflix can leverage ""essentially unlimited balance sheets"" to buy content.
""What we don't understand is why Disney would want to compete with Netflix, and other new media players, as a new media content aggregator,"" he wrote. ""With even more players entering the fray (Apple, Google), and a likely willingness by at least some of them to play a long game of loss leadership in content aggregation to support other business objectives, we expect pressure on content margins.""
Disney shares are underperforming the market this year. Its shares have rallied 3 percent through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's 19 percent gain.
""We think that this deal is an attempt by the Murdoch clan to eventually put themselves in position to run Disney,"" he wrote. ""Eventual control of Disney by the Murdochs may not be the most likely outcome, but we think it is a very possible one.""

 Kynikos' Jim Chanos on net neutrality's impact on Netflix   
 3:43  PM ET Thu, 14 Dec 2017 |  02:24 
 Famed short seller Jim Chanos is putting Netflix and other entertainment content providers in his crosshairs.
 Though he hasn't established a formal position yet, the head of Kynikos Associates sees opportunity as the competition heats up and cost starts becoming an issue.
""We're looking at all of them, let's just say that, but one or two more than the others,"" Chanos told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" in an interview Thursday. 
 Netflix's shares in particular have been on fire all year, rising some 53 percent including a 1 percent gain as Chanos gave his remarks from the sidelines of a conference in New York.
However, the hedge fund manager sees the landscape shifting. The Federal Communications Commission's move to eliminate net neutrality rules that seek to provide equal access to online content is one particular wild card.
""Netflix came out this afternoon and sort of lambasted the change of net neutrality,"" he said. ""Yet for years now they have said when asked that the change in net neutrality would not have a material effect on their business. Which is it?""
Netflix is coming off a strong quarter in which it added a better-than-expected 5.3 million subscribers and said it would have a content budget of between $7 billion and $8 billion a year. The company also announced a pricing plan increase.
""Netflix raised prices recently and analysts of course just assume most of that falls to the bottom line. But what if these price hikes really are to offset increasing costs?"" Chanos said. ""I don't think people have put that in their models.""
""The fact of the matter is Netflix is a middleman. They are making and producing and financing more of their own content, but at the end of the day so is everyone else now.""
Chanos is known for other high-profile bearish positions, particularly against electric car maker Tesla.
He also has said he is betting against hamburger chain restaurants as the industry condenses, and in September announced a short against Continental Resources.

 Cramer reviews the bear case for FANG stocks   
 6:39  PM ET Tue, 19 Dec 2017 |  00:57 
 After the decline in the FANG stocks on Tuesday, CNBC's Jim Cramer issued a warning to investors who own the technology-laden group.
 ""I just wanted to get in front of tomorrow's storyline,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""You better believe the obituary's being written once again right now, this time with the death notice containing two As and two Ns, as in FAANNG, or Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Nvidia and Google, the company now known as Alphabet.""
Weakness in the FAANNGs is bound to be taken seriously, which is why Cramer looked at the broader market layout, starting with the GOP-led tax overhaul.
 The sweeping tax cuts Republicans are chasing could put a trillion-dollar hole in the U.S. deficit. That would lead the government to borrow money, flooding the bond market with supply and driving interest rates higher.
But higher interest rates usually lead to higher inflation. Inflation erodes purchasing power, which in turn diminishes future earnings estimates.
""Given that the FAANNG stocks represent big bets on the future earnings of high-growth companies, ... inflation's real bad for them, so their stocks sell off when rates go up,"" Cramer said. ""Let me simplify it: higher rates often lead to lower prices for the most juiced stocks out there, and FAANNG be the king of the juice.""
To make sense of the noise (and explain why panic is fruitless), the ""Mad Money"" host went over each FAANNG stock's individual bear case.
 Facebook
 Word on Wall Street is that Facebook's next earnings report will be in line with estimates because the social media giant hasn't come up with a new, hot product in a while.
""It's become same-old, same-old — same-old, same-old great, I should add — and that's not enough for the market,"" Cramer said. ""I'm not kidding — that's really the rap against Facebook.""
 Amazon
 After Citi Research upgraded Walmart on Tuesday, saying that the retailer finally has enough online momentum to seriously compete with Amazon, the Amazon bears came running.
""I think Amazon is fabulous, especially its red-hot web services business,"" Cramer said, even as he agreed that Walmart is a formidable competitor. ""If we get any real weakness, I'll pound the table.""
 Apple
 Cramer has heard every bear case for Apple under the sun, including the latest downgrade that argued the tech stock's gains from the iPhone super-cycle are ""in the late innings.""
""Look, you may be tempted to sell it here and try to buy it back at lower levels,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""I think that's a fool's errand. I say own Apple, don't trade it. Every trading call to get out of Apple has been wrong. This piece did not change my mind.""
 Netflix
 In Cramer's opinion, Netflix's recent decline is all about Disney. Following the Disney-Fox deal, the bears are worried that Disney might build a competing streaming service.
""This is a tough one,"" Cramer admitted. ""I always think, though, what would it take to duplicate Netflix's business? I think certainly it would cost more than the company's current $80 billion valuation. That said, I will concede that it is definitely the most vulnerable of the FAANNGs.""
 Nvidia
 Nvidia's problem has consistently been that the semiconductor play has one of the most expensive stocks in the world.
But Cramer argued that the chipmaker dominates when it comes to gaming, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and the data center, even though its wares will certainly be challenged.
""Does that mean you should sell the stock? Look, Nvidia the stock has periodic swoons, and this one has lasted a long time, ever since the company reported,"" he said. ""I believe it's digesting a big move and this stock, like the other FAANNGs, is simply the victim of a rotation.""
 Alphabet
 The ""Mad Money"" host could hardly find a bear case for the parent company of Google.
""I think it's gaining market share and has about $100 billion in cash to fall back on,"" he said. ""Also, it [has] a swell web service business that's doing fantastically — not as good as Amazon, but still good — and an autonomous car business called Waymo that's second to none. Needless to say, I would not be a seller.""
 Final Thoughts
 In all his years in the business, Cramer has seen the FAANNG stocks pronounced dead plenty of times. But that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the underlying companies, he said.
""Don't let some analyst downgrade or some rotation out of high growth scare you away from owning some FAANNG,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Until I see a coroner's report from real competitors of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Nvidia and Alphabet, I think we need to presume that these stories remain very much alive.""

87,2017-12-21,"How this familiar stock outperformed Apple, Amazon, Google and Netflix over the past 7 years  ","In 2009, executives at Domino's reevaluated their business model in light of an influx of customer complaints, such as ""Worst excuse for pizza I've ever had,"" ""Microwave pizza is far superior,"" and, frequently, ""Domino's tastes like cardboard.""
 Since 2010, the company's stock has appreciated 2000 percent, reports The Motley Fool, in that time frame outperforming the tech giants Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.
The Motley Fool's data extends to April 2017, when the value of Domino's stock was $180. Notably, that's lower than it's December value of $185 a share at the time of publication. 
 President and CEO Patrick Doyle turned the chain around so successfully, for one, by heeding the public's criticisms and making better pizza. But, more importantly, he invigorated focus on digital innovation and amped up their delivery service. Domino's now employs more people in their IT department than anywhere else in the company, reports CBS News, and over half of their sales come from digital platforms.
""With Domino's AnyWare, pizza can now be ordered through a variety of platforms, including Google Home, Amazon's Echo, Facebook Messenger, a smart TV, an Apple or Android smartwatch, a connected car, by texting, or by tweeting,"" notes The Motley Fool.

 They've literally made ordering a pizza as simple as tweeting out a pizza emoji.
If that wasn't enough, Domino's also managed to recently land the long-haired ""Stranger Things"" stud Joe Keery as a spokesperson. He's featured in a commercial recreating the running home-scene in the '80s hit ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" Only, in this case, Keery isn't trying to beat his parents home. He is trying to beat the pizza he is tracking on his phone, because you can also do that now.
Domino's stock has demonstrated consistent growth for years, and Doyle is continuously looking for opportunity to grow further, he told the Los Angeles Times, even if it means taking risks, such as when they added voice ordering to their app three years ago.
""That's the sort of thing that's not going to generate a fast return, but that's part of how you stay ahead of the market,"" he said.

 At Christmas, it's common for toys, gift cards and socks to be traditional stocking fillers — but how about company stocks?
 This holiday season, rap star Kanye West gave wife and entrepreneur, Kim Kardashian, stocks from major U.S. corporations, including Netflix, Amazon and Apple.
""So for one of my Christmas presents from Kanye, he gives me this little box with a Disney Mickey toy, Apple headphones, Netflix (and) Amazon gift cards and Adidas socks,"" said Kim Kardashian, entrepreneur and reality TV star, on one of her latest Instagram stories, posted Tuesday.

 ""But then, I open the next box and it is stock to Amazon, where he got the gift cards, stock to Netflix, stock to Apple – hence the little headphones, Adidas stock and Disney stock.""
In the Instagram story, Kardashian received 920 Walt Disney shares, which are worth approximately $100,000, according to the certificate. She also received around 995 shares of stock of Adidas.
Following a bumper year for U.S. stock markets — with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting 24,000 for the first time this year — a number of the companies that Kardashian mentioned, have performed strongly over the course of 2017.

89,2017-12-28,History shows Netflix and Facebook are the FAANG stocks to own to start 2018 with a bang  ,"show chapters
 Where are FAANG stocks heading in 2018?   
 5:03  AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  04:39 
 Netflix and Facebook could be the best so-called FAANG stocks for investors at the start of the year.
 FAANG refers to Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet. These stocks have seen big rallies this year.
Using data analytics platform Kensho, CNBC looked at the performance of the FAANGs if you bought them on the last trading day of December and sold the stock on the last trading day in January. 
 The average return if you did this since December 2012 is shown below and was calculated to see which of these names historically has a strong start to the year. 
 Netflix
 Netflix has beaten analyst estimates in the December quarter each time since the fourth quarter of 2012, according to data from Kensho. This could be one reason why the stock does well at the start of the year. 
Analysts are estimating earnings per share of $0.42 in the December quarter, and if Netflix beats this then the stock, which is up over 52 percent this year, could continue to rally. 
But ""there is a little more headwind to Netflix competitively going into 2018 more than going into any other year,"" according to Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights. 
Amazon is of course ramping up its spend on original content, while Disney's recent deal to buy Twenty-First Century Fox's assets has bolstered the company's streaming ambitions. Apple, Facebook and HBO have all talked up the potential of original content too. 
Meanwhile Netflix is continuing to increase its spending on original productions, creating a content war. But Netflix, which is seen as having first-mover advantage, has continued to expand internationally, and this will be the key for it holding its leadership position. 
""If they are successful expanding internationally they have strong tailwinds going into 2018.They have built an iron fence around the consumer landscape domestically, and all signs are pointing towards the international strategy hitting the ground running,"" Ives told CNBC in a phone interview. 
Still, not all analysts think Netflix is safe. Needham analyst Laura Martin told CNBC in November that ""Netflix should be scared to death"" with the competition. 
 Facebook
 Facebook has had a testing year. It was slammed for its role in letting Russian-backed ads on its platform which reached 126 million Americans in a bid to sway the outcome of 2016's election. 
As a result of this, and the increasing amount of ""fake news"" on the social network, Facebook has been hiring hundreds of people to try to monitor what is posted. Chief Financial Officer David Wehner forecast this year that with investments in original content and higher security costs, Facebook could see operating expenses rise between 45 percent and 60 percent in 2018.
Despite the rocky year, Facebook has continued to grow its user base to over 2 billion, and its stock is up over 54 percent year-to-date. Analysts are still positive on Facebook's ability to engage and monetize users thanks to two products: video and Instagram. 
Facebook recently revamped the ""Watch"" tab on its site which hosts original video content. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that Facebook is ""willing to spend as much as $1 billion"" on original video content. This will help drive engagement, analysts at Jefferies said in a note last week, reaffirming its ""buy"" rating on the stock. 
Facebook is also beginning to monetize the fast-growing user base of Instagram, the photo-sharing app it bought for $1 billion in 2012. Evercore ISI analyst Anthony DiClemente said Facebook could lead the surge in the FAANGs next year. 
 Alphabet
 Like Facebook, Alphabet has had a tricky year on the regulatory front. Google was hit with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) antitrust fine by European Union (EU) regulators in relation to its shopping service. The EU is also looking into its Android mobile operating system to see if that breaks any rules. 
Regulation remains a risk going into 2018, analysts said. But the stock is up over 34 percent year-to-date and there is still big growth potential for a number of areas.
In 2017, for the first time, mobile will represent more than half of Google's total U.S. ad revenue, according to eMarketer. This means that Google is continuing to grow in mobile. Meanwhile its YouTube video service continues to excite investors.
""YouTube continues to be the crown jewel from the ad point of view. People are spending 43 minutes a day and that is increasing into 2018,"" Ives told CNBC.
In a note at the end of November, MKM Partners said Alphabet ""has the most hidden value of all mega-caps,"" citing YouTube and its Maps products as big areas that can be further monetized. 
 Amazon
 It may be surprising that Amazon on average has a fairly quiet performance in the first month of the year given the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in November as well as the Christmas shopping period.
But usually, the impact hasn't been priced in by the end of January.
So far, there have been a number of positive noises made about Amazon's holiday performance. Ives said his research indicates that Amazon captured between 45 percent to 50 percent of all holiday online retail sales versus 38 percent during the holidays season in 2016. Prime members were spending 22 percent more than a year ago too. 
""Prime growth remains the key jewel for Amazon going forward as cross- selling around Whole Foods customers and putting up more walls/barriers around its growing Prime customer base is a major ingredient in Amazon's ability to fend off competition in 2018 and beyond,"" Ives said in a note on Wednesday.
Amazon also continues to show strong growth in its Amazon Web Services cloud businesses. And a number of analysts have forecast that the company could push further into healthcare. CNBC reported earlier this week that Amazon is also experimenting with various advertising products across its portfolio and off its website, to challenge Facebook and Google. 
Bullishness around the stock could see its value hit $1 trillion in the next year, Morgan Stanley said in a research note from November. 
 Apple
 It's been an exciting year for Apple. The U.S. technology giant released the iPhone X, the first radical redesign of its device in a long time. 
But it's also hit a few roadblocks with that same smartphone. There were long waiting times when it was first released, and on Tuesday, Taiwan's Economic Daily, citing unnamed sources, reported that Apple will slash its sales forecast for the iPhone X in the first quarter from 50 million units to 30 million.

 Apple shares drop on report of weak iPhone X demand   
 3:33  AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  03:20 
 Still, many are convinced that the iPhone X will kick off an iPhone ""supercycle"" with demand pushed out into next year. At the same time, Apple's software and services division, which includes Apple Music and other services, continues to be strong and allows the company to monetize the large iPhone user base.
At the same time, Apple's performance in China, which is seen as a key market for future growth, has improved. 
The question for many investors now is what the next big thing for Apple will be. Ives said it's unlikely to be autos, but video streaming and original content could be a big deal if Apple decide to invest.
""What is the next magic silver bullet they will build their growth story around? The ones that make the most sense is streaming content on the video side,"" Ives said.

Co-founder and CEO of Netflix Reed Hastings
 Netflix's lead in internet video streaming is unstoppable, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Macquarie Research raised its rating for Netflix shares to outperform from neutral, citing the success of the company's original-content strategy.
""Netflix is miles ahead in terms of programming hours, original content quality and time spent, and we don't expect this to change. Netflix has won,"" analyst Tim Nollen wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.
 Netflix shares were up 1.5 percent in Tuesday's premarket session. The company's stock rose 55 percent in 2017 versus the S&P 500's 19 percent return.
Nollen predicts Netflix will increase its percentage of original content to 60 percent in 2020 from an estimated 25 percent in 2017, resulting in a $2 billion cost savings in licensing fees.
""Netflix is expanding its distribution relationships with cable operators and telcos globally, international growth is taking off on a concerted strategy to develop local content offerings, and Netflix is beginning to work on ways to reduce password sharing, which could drive even more subs,"" he wrote.
Nollen increased his price target for Netflix shares to $220 from $200, representing 15 percent upside to Friday's close.
""Netflix has changed the way people watch TV, and is now pushing further into film. Consumers' increasing lack of tolerance for advertising drives them to subscription OTT services,"" the analyst wrote. ""Disney's eventual OTT service is still two years away, and won't threaten Netflix, which besides holding onto a strong US sub base is establishing passion brand status in many international markets.""

 Media stocks heat up — are they a buy in 2018?   
 4:22  PM ET Tue,  2 Jan 2018 |  02:51 
 Netflix is starting the year off with a bang, rallying 7 percent this week, and one market watcher sees double-digit gains ahead.
 From a technical perspective, Netflix is poised to rally about 12 percent from current levels, said Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray. He pointed to bullish momentum in the chart.
""We're still very much in an uptrend. We've corrected right back to the uptrend support line. It looks, to us ... purely based upon the charts ... we could see a measured move up to $230 on Netflix,"" Johnson said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""
 The stock rose 55 percent last year, and is up 7 percent in 2018 thus far. The upside comes on the back of bullish analyst coverage out Tuesday morning. Equity analysts at Macquarie upgraded Netflix, raising the firm's rating to outperform from neutral. Analyst Tim Nollen raised price targets on the stock, as well.
""We are upgrading NFLX from Neutral to Outperform as part of a broad realignment of views on media, where we prefer companies with subscription over ad-driven content, and scaled distribution with an international presence,"" Nollen wrote in a note to clients, adding that the company has ""changed the way people watch TV"" in an ever-changing media landscape.
Meanwhile, a shift in the way people consume media at large played a part in Nollen's Disney upgrade in a separate research note, in which the stock's price target and rating were raised.
""In an increasingly concentrated space where content is still king but now requires direct-to-consumer distribution, Disney has by far the highest chance of success, in our view,"" the analyst wrote, adding the Disney and Twenty-First Century Fox marriage is a positive factor.
At this juncture, in the media space, Disney is the clear pick over Netflix if investors are considering the two stocks, said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors, who primarily looks at value names over growth.
To be sure, Disney underperformed the broader market in 2017, rising 3 percent in a raging bull market, while Netflix shares gained 55 percent.
""I would prefer Disney over Netflix. I do know it's an old media company; it's a quality company with quality assets. The real issue is that the entire industry of entertainment is now having these new competitors come in, like the Amazons of the world, Netflix and Google. So the distribution channels have completely changed,"" Morganlander said Tuesday on ""Trading Nation.""
""We do like Disney. From a valuation perspective it makes sense, from a credit rating perspective it makes sense. Netflix, on the other hand ... we're value investors. That's more of a momentum name. It is a platform that we believe strongly in over 10 years. We just think that it needs the earnings to fill in, the free cash flow to fill in before we become a little bit more optimistic on that name,"" he said.
Shares of Netflix rallied 2 percent Wednesday, while Disney shares were modestly higher.

 Investors have been binging on Netflix this week, sending the stock to all-time highs. TradingAnalysis.com's Todd Gordon says the streaming platform's run is hardly done.
 According to Gordon, the stock just broke out of a consolidation near the $200 region, and based on one market theory Netflix is set to soar higher. Gordon is basing his prediction on the Elliott Wave theory, which posits that stock prices move in waves in repetitive cycles. He says that Netflix is poised for another wave up.
""[Netflix is now in what is] considered fourth wave, which means we're going to have one more breakout that should target the zone of February resistance right around the $250 mark,"" he said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""
 Since Netflix is set to report earnings on Jan. 22, Gordon wants to make a bullish bet on the stock by selling a put spread. Leading into earnings, the implied volatility, or the price of options, tends to rise, meaning that buying options becomes expensive. As a result, by selling a put spread, Gordon can bet on Netflix without making an expensive trade.
Gordon suggested selling the Jan. 26 weekly 205/195 put spread for a credit of $3.90, or $390 per options spread. This means that if Netflix closes above $205 on Jan. 26, then Gordon would make the $390 credit on the trade.
But if Netflix closes below $195 on Jan. 26, then Gordon could face a maximum loss of $635. To avoid the loss, Gordon establishes a point at which to get out of the trade. In this case, he looks at the $200 region, the breakout point for Netflix, as the level to do so.
""[$200] should be your newly formed support level,"" he said. ""If not, let's get out and contain this.""
Netflix has had a strong start to the year, rallying 7 percent in the first three trading days of 2018.

Will Smith in Netflix film Bright.
 Netflix's lead in the internet video streaming market is so large the company's poorly reviewed movies can do well, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating for Netflix shares, citing the success of its movie ""Bright.""
""Netflix ended the year with the release of major film Bright, which despite weak critic reviews, had an estimated 11mn viewers in the first three days, roughly on par with a successful blockbuster movie opening in the theaters and nearly the numbers we saw from the highly anticipated second season of Stranger Things,"" analyst Nat Schindler wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""We expect Netflix to continue to increase spending on original content and feature films to grow subscribers, which would lead to healthy top line growth.""
 Schindler raised his price target for Netflix shares to $233 from $225, representing 10 percent upside from Monday's close.
""Bright"" received the approval of just 27 percent of the critics on Rotten Tomatoes.
The analyst noted Netflix already announced a sequel to ""Bright,"" which means it is satisfied with the performance of its first large budget movie. He also said the movie did better viewership than the company's ""The Crown"" season 2.
""We continue to think Netflix is in a strong position to capitalize on the shift to on demand viewing, the acceleration of cord cutting and the global demand for premium video content,"" he wrote. ""Netflix is in a unique position where it can afford to spend on acquiring and producing premium content and still have that spend be efficient given its global subscriber base.""

Comic con fans gather at the Netflix booth at Comic Con International in San Diego, California, July 19, 2017.
 Netflix's original content success will boost its financial results, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Barclays initiated coverage for Netflix shares with an overweight rating, predicting strong subscriber and revenue gains for the next few years.
""Netflix bull case at the core is relatively simple — if subscriber growth is faster than content cost growth over time, it could become one of the most successful media companies. We believe this is possible,"" analyst Kannan Venkateshwar wrote in a note to clients Thursday.
 ""Our view is supported by Netflix's global footprint and access to ~550mm broadband subs, demonstrated pricing power, growing content library, changing mix towards local content, and its increasing 'stickiness' due to multiple seasons of established originals.""
Venkateshwar started his price target for Netflix shares at $245, representing 15 percent upside to Wednesday's close.
The analyst noted Netflix has roughly 5,800 titles on its streaming service and will spend $10 billion to $12 billion for content this year. He predicts the company will generate annual sales growth of 27 percent through 2019 from 2016.
""Inertia tends to benefit early movers and market leaders and is likely to help pricing growth and costs to potentially drive margin expansion over time,"" he wrote. ""In our opinion, in the next 3-5 years Netflix is likely to become the second biggest media company by revenue (ignoring studios and theme parks), next only to Disney.""

Reed Hastings, CEO, Netflix
 Recently, there's been a lot of talk about Apple possibly buying Netflix. The new round of speculation seems to have been kick-started by Barry Ritholtz in  Bloomberg View last November. (Some skeptical takes are here and here.)
Forget it. It's too late. There's no chance this will happen now.
 Here's why.
It's too expensive — even for Apple.
Netflix is trading at all-time highs. Its market cap is around $94 billion. Barry Ritholtz's piece in November thought that Apple could pick it up for $100 billion. I can guarantee you that there's no chance that Tim Cook could buy Netflix from Reed Hastings for just a 6% premium.
And never forget that Reed Hastings is a Netflix founder. Founders generally see enormous potential ahead of the business and are reluctant to pass over the keys to their car for a tiny premium. 
It would be especially difficult for Reed to sell when Netflix has reached escape velocity as an Over-The-Top (OTT) service and continues to see robust subscription growth across the world. Most new TVs today come with distinct Netflix buttons on the remotes.
Netflix now has over 100 million subscribers worldwide. A few years ago, many analysts and observers thought it was unlikely that they'd break past 30 million domestic subscribers because that had previously been a ceiling for HBO.
Of course, there's strategic logic to Apple buying Netflix. They have a subscription music service in Apple Music. They certainly need a subscription video service. They've  already hired Hollywood talent to oversee their own original video strategy and they've earmarked money for stars like  Jennifer Anniston and Reese Witherspoon. They're going to need a video service. They won't just throw it up on Apple Music and hope that you see it like Planet of the Apps.
But my guess is that, Apple being Apple (i.e., acquisition averse), they'll just do it themselves without buying anyone.
Don't get me wrong, I've  long wanted to see Apple go on an acquisition binge. I'd  previously argued in 2011 when Facebook was worth $50 billion that Apple should buy it for $100 billion. Last year, around this time,  I pointed out that Apple had really missed the window to buy Tesla, Netflix, and Instagram.
The time to acquire Netflix would have been back in 2014 or earlier. Back then, Netflix was still in the early days of rolling out its original programming strategy. Its subscriber base was much smaller. And — most importantly — its market cap was about 25% of where it is currently.
As a Netflix shareholder, I'd benefit if there was some buyout of the company. But I don't think Reed Hastings would accept an offer even at a 100% premium today. And it would likely take that type of premium just to get him and his board to consider it. That's simply too big a check — even for Apple, the biggest company in the world. You're talking a $200 billion takeout price.
Apple can still have success doing its own thing with its video service. It will probably be the #2 streaming service behind Netflix for a while (perhaps until Disney's service launches in 2019). It has the #2 music service with Apple Music after Spotify. Apple still has a lot of potential for future growth in front of it.
I will still scratch my head though at why they weren't more aggressive from an M&A perspective a few years ago — even if they would have had to pay a little bit more in repatriation taxes to do so.
The window to buy Netflix is now firmly shut.

 Make money with 'this time it's different'   
 6:49  PM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  00:51 
 Back in the day, CNBC's Jim Cramer would always hear that the four most dangerous words in the English language were ""this time it's different.""
 And when it came to market-rattling events like the dotcom bubble burst — when investors chased internet stocks to artificial highs hoping to catch the ""next big thing"" — that idea usually proved right.
""But honestly, I've now been at this business a pretty long time, and I'm beginning to wonder if the four most dangerous words about stock investing are 'this time it's the same,'"" the ""Mad Money"" host said on Friday.
 After watching big-cap tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet drive the market to new heights, Cramer argued that a ""this-time-it's-different"" mentality could've cost investors fortunes if they had applied it to the FANG names.
Investors would've kicked themselves if they were so shaken by the dotcom bubble that they avoided getting in on the Harvard-born craze that became the $521 billion Facebook, he said.
""You really had to believe this time it's different if you were going to buy some shares in some online retailer where you gave them your credit card information and actually trusted that they'd send you [product] overnight,"" Cramer said. ""But Amazon did become a $629 billion profitable company.""
""This time it's different"" would've made you rich if you believed in a money-losing company that rented out DVDs, because that company became the $95 billion giant that is Netflix, Cramer said.
""This time it's the same"" would've kept you from investing in a website that provides information based on anything you type, yet another dotcom name that eventually became Alphabet, the $782 billion parent of Google.
""The graybeards missed all of these stories because of their old saw,"" Cramer said. ""It stopped them from taking what turned out to be a calculated gamble on four companies that would have made fortunes for those who believed things really would be different this time.""

 Charts: Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix and Nvidia may pull back   
 7:39  PM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  01:21 
 As the bank- and health-care-led market rally pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above the 26,000 level for the first time ever, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to check in with tech.
 ""You always need to be thinking about when it might be time to do a little register-ringing,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""I don't want to scare you away from stocks. Just the opposite — like I said, I like stocks. But if you're going to be a responsible investor, you need to be at least considerate of whether it's a good idea to maybe be a little cautious.""
The stocks of Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix and Nvidia all made 52-week highs on Tuesday amid the surge, so Cramer enlisted technician Carolyn Boroden to determine if it was time for investors to take some profits off the table.
 Boroden, the brain behind FibonacciQueen.com and Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com, said that with the four stocks nearing her price targets, now is the time to get careful.
""Boroden's not saying these stocks have peaked, not by any means, but she does think it's time to be a little more cautious,"" Cramer said. ""Is there anything wrong with that? I don't think so.""
Boroden began with Amazon's weekly chart. Being the ""Fibonacci Queen,"" she uses Fibonacci ratios — a series of number patterns discovered by medieval mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci — to find the levels where a stock is most likely to change its trajectory.
 The stock of Amazon recently reached two key Fibonacci levels, which Boroden saw as a sign that it might pull back in the near future.
Beyond that, Amazon's rally ending in October 2016 lasted for $373.21, exactly the same amount, to the cent, as the following upswing.
With Amazon hovering around $408 a share, this rally has been longer in the tooth. But because the October 2016 rally was followed by a $137 decline and the following rally by a $151 decline, Boroden had reason to suspect a pullback.
""Of course, she's not saying these patterns will exactly repeat themselves, but Amazon has gotten extended here,"" Cramer said. ""It doesn't take a genius to realize that a pullback conceivably could be in the offing. Throw in the fact that Amazon's got a ceiling of resistance at $1,344 and you've got another reason, let's say, to play it safe.""
Netflix's stock also recently reached a Fibonacci price extension that tends to happen before a decline, Boroden said. Like Amazon, the stock's daily chart shows it making a familiar run toward its ceiling of resistance.
 ""Most of Netflix's recent runs have lasted for anywhere from 44 to 47 points,"" Cramer said. ""Given that the stock is now up 45 points in its current rally and is facing a tough ceiling of resistance in the mid-$220s, Boroden thinks this is another one where you might want to book a couple of profits ahead of a pullback.""
Alphabet's stock looked overextended to Boroden, too. But she also became cautious after analyzing its daily chart's Y-axis to find the dates when its trajectory could change.
 Using her signature methodology, Boroden discovered a series of Fibonacci timing cycles that started last week and lasted through Wednesday.
""So if the stock's going to take a break and pull back, there's a very good chance it will happen pretty darned soon,"" Cramer explained.
Finally, Boroden found the stock of Nvidia approaching a key Fibonacci extension level in its daily chart, similar to the others in its red-hot cohort.
 Despite being bullish on Nvidia's long-term prospects, Boroden noted the symmetry between the stock's recent $45 rally and its last $48 run, suggesting that it might soon lose some steam.
""Now, Boroden's not turning negative on these terrific stocks. She's just saying, 'Don't abandon ship, but recognize there could be some choppy waters ahead,'"" Cramer said. ""Bottom line is that even the best stocks in the hottest of bull markets ... need to take breathers every now and then when they're snorting. And the charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, suggest that you might want to get more cautious [in the] short term with Amazon, with Alphabet, with Netflix and with Nvidia, because all four seem ready for temporary pullbacks. What can I say? You're up huge if you own these. Would it really hurt you that badly if you took something off the table?""

99,2018-01-17,"Netflix to beat subscriber expectations for fourth quarter, analyst predicts  Here's how former US president Barack Obama spent his first day out of office nearly a year ago  ","Robyn Beck | AFP | Getty Images
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings gives a keynote address, January 6, 2016 at the CES 2016 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.
 Netflix shares will thrive as the streaming giant builds on its original content and its international expansion, according to one Wall Street firm.
 GBH Insights reiterated its ""highly attractive"" rating for Netflix shares, predicting better-than-expected subscriber additions during its fourth quarter. The quarterly results are to be announced Monday.
Daniel Ives, GBH Insights' head of technology research, said in a note to clients on Tuesday that Netflix is likely to show stronger-than-expected subscriber additions despite a domestic price increase and that it ""should handily exceed the Street's estimates across the board.""
 The analyst said his bullish case for Netflix is based on its strong competitive advantage and franchise appeal, its ability to increase its international streaming subscriber base through 2020 and original content offerings that ""will translate into robust profitability and growth as the next phase of this story plays out over the coming year.""
Ives increased his price target to $255 from $235 for Netflix shares. The new target is 15 percent higher than Tuesday's closing price. He also raised his Netflix net subscriber forecast to 7 million from 6.3 million for the December quarter versus the Wall Street consensus of 6.3 million.
He said Netflix will spend $7 billion to $8 billion for content in 2018 and noted that the company expects to use 50 percent of its budget for original content by 2020, up from the 25 percent it used last year.
""With more consumer dollars shifting away from traditional cable with cord cutting and towards streaming delivery, we believe Netflix has a long runway of growth and opportunity ahead of itself and clear first mover advantage despite intense competition from larger media players (Disney), pure play competitors, and new potential entrants (e.g. Apple),"" he wrote.
Despite the call, Netflix shares were down 2.2 percent Wednesday.

 And it was pretty mundane: ""I slept in, which I was pretty happy about,"" Obama told the former late-night television host.
""It was great, I did not miss the trappings of the office,"" Obama added. ""I sort of enjoyed puttering around the house, trying to figure out how does the coffee maker work and fighting with Michelle for closet space.""

Former U.S. president Barack Obama sits on stage with David Letterman for interview on ""My Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman.""
 Without much delay, Obama took his wife, former first lady Michelle Obama, on vacation to billionaire Richard Branson's own private island Necker Island, located in the British Virgin Islands.
""I took Michelle on a holiday. I missed my wife, we hadn't kind of hung out. So we spent 10 days and had a wonderful time,"" Obama said.

 ""The first words Michelle said as she stepped onto the island were, 'we're free!'"" Branson said. ""They had 10 wonderful days, they could let their hair down. Barack spent the whole time out on the water learning to kitesurf and we had a friendly competition which wasn't so friendly, he won. He's a fit, healthy guy.""
Branson noted on the last night of the couple's stay, Obama threw a party for the staff and by the end, he knew every single person's name, down to the cleaners and dishwashers.
 Challenged President Barack Obama to a kitesurfing v foilboarding contest - here's what happened. A post shared by  Richard Branson (@richardbranson) on Feb 7, 2017 at 4:06am PST 
 ""It was magical, hopefully magical for them, it was magical for all of us to have them there and give them a good chance to have a proper break after eight years of hard work,"" Branson said.
Upon returning to Washington D.C., Obama said he and his family stayed in the area because his younger daughter Sasha was still in high school.
""We had gotten a house a few blocks from where I used to live,"" Obama teased, referring to their $8.1 million mansion in Kalorama, located just two miles from the White House.
By the time Obama and his family settled down in their new home, he told Letterman he didn't feel relieved, but rather proud.
""I think there was a sense that I had run the race, I had completed it. I was proud of the work we had done,"" Obama said. ""I was ready for the next stage.""
Compared to how quickly life moved for Obama as president, he found that, comparatively, ""everything felt like it was moving in slow motion.""
He gave the example of his million-dollar Penguin Random House book deal: When Obama's book agent said his publishers were eager to take the next step, Obama was ready to meet the next day. The agent responded by saying, ""Oh no, it's going to take two weeks to set it up.""
""I had to explain to him where I'm coming from 'right away' means if we don't do something in half an hour somebody dies,"" Obama said.
Nonetheless, the former president anticipated what lay ahead. ""The stereotype of former presidents is you're kind of sitting around your house, waiting for somebody to call and you're kind of lonely and don't know what to do,"" Obama said. ""But the truth is, it felt exciting.""

Comic con fans gather at the Netflix booth at Comic Con International in San Diego, California, July 19, 2017.
 Netflix's strong growth in international markets and its ability to raise prices will boost its shares, according to one top Wall Street firm.
 Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating on Netflix shares, citing the economies of scale from its large subscriber base.
""We believe share performance is highly dependent on increasing global membership scale. Proven success in the US and initial int'l markets provides a roadmap to success in new markets, and scale should allow Netflix to leverage content investments and drive margins,"" analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a note to clients Thursday.
 Over the longer term, Swinburne says Netflix has the ability to generate growth in average revenue per user, especially given its increase in original programming.
He increased his price target to $255 from $235 for Netflix shares. The new target is 17 percent higher than Wednesday's closing price.
The analyst said Netflix's penetration of broadband-enabled households in international markets outside of China rose to 13 percent last year from 9 percent in 2016.
""These markets also grew despite a generally higher price point for consumers and benefited more from Netflix original programming than prior markets in prior years,"" Swinburne wrote.
In the last three years, Netflix's annual average revenue per user has grown 10 percent, and ""this suggests our long-term forecast of +4-5% could be conservative,"" the note said.
Netflix is one of the market's best-performing stocks. Its shares have rallied 63 percent in the previous 12 months through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's 23 percent gain.
The company's shares were up 1 percent midday Thursday.

 Hargreaves raised his price target to $270 from $230 for Netflix shares, representing 23 percent upside to Thursday's close.
The analyst noted a recent report from the International Telecommunication Union that revealed broadband internet access was rising worldwide faster than expected. That makes Netflix's potential market bigger and ""prompts a corresponding increase to our estimates for Netflix's international subscribers in 2018 and beyond,"" Hargreaves wrote.
As a result, he increased his 2018 global net subscriber forecast for Netflix to 20.6 million from 19.3 million.
Hargreaves said Netflix's large scale and content library will enable the company to beat its competition and produce subscriber growth and profitability ""well ahead of current expectations.""
Netflix is one of the market's best-performing stocks. Its shares have rallied 59 percent in the past 12 months versus the S&P 500's 24 percent gain.

 Cramer: Why Amazon's latest move is a sign to buy the stock   
 6:56  PM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 |  00:53 
 When a company like Amazon raises the prices for its service and nobody cares, CNBC's Jim Cramer sees a clear next move.
 ""When you see something like that, it's about as clear a buy signal as you are ever, ever, ever going to get,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said on Friday after Amazon upped the price of its monthly Prime membership rate by 18 percent.
The price boost — from $10.99 to $12.99 for full-paying members — will total $156 a year, a ""smart"" move considering Amazon's yearly membership rate of $99 will remain the same, Cramer said.
 ""It's basically a tax on people who only pay month-to-month,"" he said.
Better yet, Cramer expected no resistance ""whatsoever"" to the price increase thanks to the quality and value that Amazon's Prime service provides.
""I bet most people don't even notice the price hike,"" he said. ""That's why Amazon remains a go-to name for anyone who needs a high-growth stock to round out their portfolio.""
The same goes for Netflix, Cramer argued. Nobody cared or resisted when the streaming giant raised the price of its 4K plan, which offers higher quality content, to $13.99 a month.
""Given that I pay $24 for two seats in a movie theater — $24 for a couple of maybe lousy hours of entertainment, pre-popcorn-and-candy, by the way — I'm thrilled to shell out a little more than just half that to binge on quality homegrown programming ... for a whole month,"" Cramer said.
Customers of Costco, which boasts some of the biggest bargains on the market, also tend to overlook when the big-box retailer raises the price of its membership cards, Cramer noted.
Apple's cloud service revenues also fall into this category. If privately-held music app Spotify ever comes public, its subscription-based service likely will, too, he said.
""The next time you get hit with a price increase and it doesn't bother you one bit, you need to pay up for the stock of that company in question, maybe even the next day,"" the ""Mad Money"" host concluded. ""In every instance I just mentioned ... it's been worth it.""

 Netflix looks attractive heading into its quarterly earnings report being issued Monday afternoon, even after a massive run, strategist Mark Tepper says.
 Netflix shares have jumped 15 percent this year alone, and a whopping 65 percent in the last year. Shares rose over 1 percent on Thursday after Morgan Stanley released a bullish note on the stock.  Ahead of earnings, investors still have time to get in on the stock despite its run, said Tepper, president and CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners. Here are his reasons:  • While many investors may focus on revenue and earnings growth, the key metric to watch will be subscriber growth, which will likely beat analysts' expectations.  • This would be a strong indication of long-term growth and show the streaming video company is on pace for a strong year.  • For now, Netflix could be viewed as a buy, though investors should consider the competition that could arise next year as Disney prepares to remove its content from Netflix and launch its own streaming service.  The stock currently trades at a hefty 92 times forward earnings, according to FactSet data.  Bottom line: Tepper sees further upside for Netflix and marks it a buy at these levels, even after a big run.

Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix.
 Netflix CEO Reed Hastings is playing it cool about competition from Disney's upcoming over-the-top video service.
 Hastings said he plans to subscribe to Disney's service, which would not only compete with Netflix but could include a lot of content that Disney says it will pull from Netflix.
""I think in particular Disney, with its strength of brand and unique content, will have some real success. I know I'll be a subscriber of it for my own personal watching. The same way as many Disney and Fox executives also subscribe to Netflix,"" Hastings said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts. 
 Disney agreed to buy Twenty-First Century Fox assets late last year, a deal that would give the combined company a significant stake in another Netflix rival, Hulu. But Hastings pointed out that Netflix is different in key ways, including the lack of advertising.
""Everyone knows the costs of competition, but the benefits are that your competitors are challenger brands, so they don't tend to follow your strategy,"" Hastings said. ""We get to learn from that. Our view would be to let them try to innovate on those aspects and watch what they do and learn from consumers. Do they really love it? It doesn't change our strategy."" 
Investors are betting that Hastings is right: Shares rose more than 10 percent on Tuesday, a day after the company reported better-than-expected subscriber growth in its Q4 2017 earnings report.
""Our thing is working, and what we have to do is not get distracted,"" Hastings said. ""Total streaming will grow faster because of the competition.""

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings delivers a keynote address at CES 2016 at The Venetian Las Vegas on January 6, 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada.
 Analysts expect Netflix to post a big quarter after the bell on Monday, bolstered by subscriber growth ahead of Netflix's previously announced estimate of 6.3 million. The company's stock rose 2.5 percent in early trading Monday.
 GBH Insights chief strategy officer and head of technology Daniel Ives believes Netflix's subscription addition estimate was low, and expects that price increases did not drive that many people away, while the movie ""Bright"" and new seasons of ""The Crown"" and ""Stranger Things"" kept users around.
Through surveys, GBH Insights believes net ads this quarter will approach 7 million.
 ""They were a little conservative on guidance on domestic given the price increase, but we didn't see any chinks in the armor,"" Ives said, adding that he expects the company to have a more profitable trajectory relative to the past two years.

 Forrester principal analyst Jim Nail said the holidays tend to be a strong quarter for Netflix, leading him to believe it will post large subscriber ads this quarter than projected. 
And while it is spending up to $8 billion on content this year, the large figure is a ""necessary evil"" to remain competitive against other services, Ives said. 
""We're just continuing to see the cord cutting phenomenon going into Netflix's lap,"" he said.
There are some questions going forward about the negative impact of Disneyremoving its content from Netflix in 2019and Disney's larger ownership stake in Hulu due to the Disney-Fox deal, Ives said,  but he expects to see the impact more in the latter half of 2018.
""If [CEO Reed] Hastings wakes up at night with a nightmare, it's Iger and Disney,"" Ives said. ""Going into this earnings it needs to be a beat and raise type of outlook. The stock has had a huge run. We still think it's in its fifth or sixth inning."" 
It's also questionable whether Netflix can sustain subscriber interest at the current pricing level, and Forrester's Nail expects more price increases to come.
While the company doesn't have to have a hit with each show because it's not dependent on advertising, it still has to have enough hits to ensure people will be willing to pay for the service each month. 
""They redefine what is good and crap,"" Nail said. ""Their business is no longer defined by, 'Does the show generate a big enough audience for advertisers?' What you and I may think is crap, somebody may watch it and like it. They'll see a $12 charge on their credit card bill, but will that show be enough to pay $12 for Netflix?""
Analysts expect Netflix to post EPS of 41 cents on revenue of $3.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.

 Netflix shares pop on strong guidance   
 7:05  PM ET Mon, 22 Jan 2018 |  03:05 
 Netflix joined the $100 billion club on Monday night.
 The streaming giant gained far more customers than Wall Street expected during the holiday season, it said Monday, when it reported quarterly earnings that were in line with estimates.
Shares of Netflix jumped more than 8 percent after hours, pushing the market capitalization of the company above $100 billion for the first time.
 After adding 8.33 million subscribers in the fourth quarter — the highest ever — the company expects its winning streak to continue: First-quarter earnings guidance was well above estimates. Netflix is also burning less cash than Wall Street thought, as the international base became profitable.
 Earnings in line, net adds blowout
 EPS: 41 cents vs. 41 cents per share expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Revenue: $3.29 billion vs. $3.28 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Domestic streaming net adds: 1.98 million vs 1.29 million expected by a StreetAccount estimate International streaming net adds: 6.36 million vs. 5.10 million expected by a StreetAccount estimate Total net adds: 8.33 million vs. 6.39 million expected Free cash flow: -$524 million vs. -$742 million expected by a FactSet estimate 
That's compared with earnings of 15 cents per share and revenue of $2.48 billion in the year-ago period. In October, the company said it expected fourth-quarter earnings of 41 cents per share on revenue of $3.274 billion, adding 1.25 million U.S. streaming customers and 5.05 million internationally.

 Netflix surges on earnings, and one technician says keep buying

 Netflix said now that it has more revenue from new members, it plans to spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion on content in 2018. That's not a plateau, either — CEO Reed Hastings expects content spending to be even higher in 2019 and 2020, he said on a conference call with analysts.Despite spending less than projected during the fourth quarter, Netflix said it expects negative free cash flow of $3 billion to $4 billion in 2018, and said it will continue to ""raise capital in the high yield market."" However, the company leaned on its solid track record, noting that it does eventually expect to become free-cash-flow positive.
""We believe our big investments in content are paying off,"" said the company's shareholder letter announcing its earnings. 
 Bullish first-quarter guidance

 Media consolidation casts a shadow over Netflix's future
 Netflix remains the dominant over-the-top video provider by many metrics. But Monday's earnings report comes amid challenges for the company. 
On one hand, prices are going up while some of the company's content investments haven't gone as planned. Netflix said in October that its $10-per-month high-definition plan would rise to $11. Meanwhile, ""Bright,"" which the company touted as its ""most ambitious film yet"" in October, was panned by popular review sites.
Nonetheless, Netflix said, ""Bright"" has become one of the most viewed original titles ever, and will be followed by a sequel. The company said Monday it had increased marketing spending on original content and was seeing some success.
Netflix's chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, said the critics are an important part of the artistic process but are ""pretty disconnected"" from the way consumers viewed ""Bright."" 
At the same time, the prospect of more competition looms on the horizon. It's been nearly six months since Disney said it planned to pull its movies from Netflix in favor of its own service. Since then, Disney also agreed to buy Twenty-First Century Fox assets, a megadeal that would give the combined company a significant stake in Netflix's rival, Hulu.
""I was as surprised as anyone else that Fox was willing to sell,"" Hastings said. ""And to have all those cable networks together in one bundle gives them enormous pricing power."" 
Not only that, but Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google's YouTube have doubled down on content.
Sarandos has said he doesn't want to get ""too distracted by the competitive landscape,"" and that these changes were a long time coming. Analysts admit the company has some advantages, noting the popularity of shows like ""The Crown"" and ""Stranger Things.""
Hastings said he thinks that it's possible that a wave of consolidation is coming, and that he thinks Disney will be successful thanks to its super-strong brand. But he said if there is consolidation, Netflix won't be involved, and that his company will grow ""just fine"" without Disney's content.
""The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many successful services. In addition, entertainment services are often complementary given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow,"" the company said.
The backlash against sexual misconduct allegations also touched Netflix during 2017 with the departure of ""House of Cards"" star Kevin Spacey. The company said it wrote down the value of $39 million in unreleased projects during the quarter, but did not go into specifics. But executives did note on a conference call that it was the first write-down of that magnitude, ""related to the societal reset around sexual harassment.""
Netflix also reiterated its challenge to the repeal of net neutrality regulations by the FCC, even though the company is partnering with a growing number of internet service providers.  Rodolphe Belmer, CEO of Eutelsat, a global satellite business, will also join the Netflix board of directors.
Netflix shares are up more than 64 percent over the past year.   Disclosure: Comcast, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, is a co-owner of Hulu.

 Netflix had a 'home run quarter' especially international   
 10:41  PM ET Mon, 22 Jan 2018 |  02:44 
 After Netflix crushed subscriber forecasts again, its market value surged toward $110 billion on Tuesday. Wall Street analysts believe the streaming leader is just getting started.
 ""Netflix's current growth profile suggests that it continues to accelerate away from competition, and that the power of its competitive advantages is growing,"" KeyBanc Capital Markets' Andy Hargreaves wrote in a note to clients Monday entitled ""Catch Me If You Can."" ""We believe Netflix's global reach and data feedback loop provide leading investment efficiency, while its investment scale is growing at a level that others appear unable to match.""
Netflix said Monday it added 8.3 million subscribers in the fourth quarter compared with expectations for 6.4 million. The shares closed up 10 percent Tuesday at $250.29, giving it a market value of nearly $110 billion.
 Hargreaves reiterated his overweight rating and raised his price target to $300 from $270 from Netflix shares, representing 32 percent upside to Monday's close.
Wall Street believes Netflix's original content production is the key to its success.
""Driving more high quality content is a critical part of NFLX's virtuous circle, and the mix will continue to shift toward originals & self-produced,"" J.P. Morgan's Doug Anmuth wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""Netflix's virtuous circle remains strong & the company continues to benefit from the ongoing disruption of linear TV.""
Anmuth reaffirmed his overweight rating and increased his price target to $285 from $242 for Netflix shares.
One analyst noted even Netflix's poorly reviewed content such as Will Smith's movie ""Bright"" is paying dividends for the company.
Netflix is ramping ""up content & marketing spend in 2018 as investments fuel subscriber growth,"" Stifel's Scott Devitt wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""Netflix was 'thrilled' with the performance of its first big budget feature film, Bright, as it drove a notable lift in acquisition when it was released in December despite being widely panned by critics.""
As a result of the success, Netflix announced on Monday it plans to increase its content spending guidance to $7.5 billion to $8 billion this year from $7 billion to $8 billion.

 The Nasdaq composite closed at a record high on Tuesday after Netflix shares surged on stronger-than-expected subscriber growth.
 The video streaming giant said Monday after the close that total net adds reached 8.33 million, well above a StreetAccount estimate of 6.39 million. Netflix's stock surged 10 percent, lifting the company's market cap above $100 billion for the first time.
The Nasdaq finished 0.7 percent higher at 7,460.29.

 ""Stocks will continue to benefit from the earnings driven bull market that we have experienced over the past 18 months both in the U.S. and abroad,"" said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics. Thus far, stocks have responded positively to quarterly results, Chaikin added.
The calendar fourth-quarter earnings season is off to a good start. As of Tuesday, 76 percent of the S&P 500 companies that had reported surpassed earnings expectations, while 84 percent of those companies had beaten sales estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Ed Yardeni, president and chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, said in a note forward earnings are also on the rise. ""Momentum remains strong, as the yearly change in forward earnings is up from six-year lows in early 2016 and should accelerate in 2018,"" he said.
Wall Street also looked to Washington as a three-day government shutdown concluded. During Monday's session, members of the Senate managed to secure a temporary arrangement to keep the U.S. government open until February 8. The vote propelled the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite to all-time highs.
The chamber passed a stopgap bill by a margin of 81-18. Members of the House later passed the bill, which was signed by President Donald Trump.
John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington Private Bank, said the market viewed the shutdown ""as a politics issue, not an economic issue.""

 Cramer Remix: Why the run in Netflix makes me upset   
 9:55  PM ET Tue, 23 Jan 2018 |  01:08 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer would usually be happy about Netflix's huge Monday earnings beat, but this time around, he was a little disappointed.
 ""Normally I love it when my favorite stocks surge higher, but today's 10 percent run in Netflix kind of had me bummed me out,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""What makes me upset is the fact that Netflix could've been acquired for less than half of its current price a few years ago, and whoever bought it would now be the king of content.""
Cramer lamented the fact that from the start, Netflix emerged as a streaming video powerhouse and could have been bought by any of the market's top technology companies.
 ""At the end of the day, I am torn. On the one hand, I love that Netflix continues to make so much money for you, the shareholders. On the other, I can't stop thinking about what a huge missed opportunity this would have been for the big boys – for the Apples, for the Amazons, for the Alphabets,"" Cramer said. ""A Netflix acquisition would've been a game-changer for these guys. Instead, they thought they made the mistake of thinking, 'Duplicate Netflix,' and now it's too late for them to duplicate or buy.""
 Checking your bias
 Photographer | CNBC 
 It used to be an unspoken rule for investors to sell stocks at the first sign of negative news, but sometimes, the rules have to change, Cramer said Tuesday.
""This time is indeed different, which means you can't take your cue from the playbook that worked in more troubled times,"" he said. ""We've developed a vicious tendency to want to give up on stocks of companies that slip up, especially after big moves ... but you know what? These days, that tendency will lead you astray.""
In a market that brushes off weak earnings reports and formerly market-rattling events, Cramer said that having long-standing biases about certain companies and stocks can hurt investors.
One example of this was the recent action in Facebook's stock after the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced sweeping changes to the social media website's News Feed.
 Off the charts: Oil approaching a peak?

Oil workers make a pipe connection on a drilling rig near Encinal, Texas.
 Rising oil prices have breathed new life into the oil patch, but the sudden enthusiasm has made Cramer wonder if it can all be chalked up to irrational exuberance.
So the ""Mad Money"" host called on technician Carley Garner, the oil-savvy co-founder of DeCarley Trading and author of Higher Probability Commodity Trading, to help explain the positive action.
""Garner's worried that the same animal spirits luring speculators into high-flying stocks and even cryptocurrencies may have migrated to the oil market,"" Cramer said.
With that, he turned to Garner's first chart: the weekly chart of West Texas Intermediate crude, complete with the critical Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Commitments of Traders report.
 Barstool Sports founder and CEO talk brand engagement

Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy
 Erika Nardini, a former AOL executive who landed the CEO job at Barstool Sports in 2016 as the only woman out of roughly 70 candidates, had been a fan of Barstool founder Dave Portnoy's from the beginning, she told Cramer.
""Barstool, to me, is what guys say, it's how they think, it's how they talk, it's what they love, and here was this guy who took a bet on himself and strived to build something and I wanted to be a part of it,"" she said in a Monday interview with Cramer and Portnoy.
Asked whether she had any price constraints on her mind when it came to selling the privately-held company, she offer a flat ""No.""
""We're a big media company. We are a huge brand,"" Nardini said. ""Because we have a loyal audience that has been with Dave for 14 years, and all of our guys — Big Cat, KFC, our whole roster — we can do anything. We can become a commerce company. We can sell shoes. We can be an alcohol brand. We can create a boxing promoter. There is nothing that this company can't do because we have an audience, we listen to them and we create only for them.""
 Connecting the dots in TE Connectivity?
 Ahead of TE Connectivity's Wednesday morning earnings report, Cramer wanted investors to be ready for the minor blip that would bring its stock back to buyable levels.
A spin-off of Tyco International, TE Connectivity makes electrical components that enable the flow of power and data for a number of lucrative end markets.
Better yet, its stock tends to sell off even after management reports strong quarterly earnings, giving investors a momentary entry point.
""When you find a high-quality company that's making a killing thanks to the booming economy, you should be preparing yourself for the next pullback so you can buy it into weakness,"" Cramer said. ""TE Connectivity's been on fire, reports tomorrow morning, and I want you to be ready, just in case it goes down despite delivering what I expect will be a generally strong quarter. If we don't get a pullback, the stock is cheap enough that you can put on a small position, but ideally, I need you to wait for that next dip, even as they're few and far between in this market.""
 Lightning round: Don't ignore CHRW
 In Cramer's lightning round, he shared his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
C.H. Robinson Worldwide: ""You know what? That's one of the best stocks out there. It's not just all FedEx, it's not just all XPO and it's not just all UPS. It's them, too.""
Green Plains Inc.: ""I don't like ethanol plants. I think it's only a matter of time before the president says, 'Maybe this is a bad idea.'""

Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix.
 Most of Wall Street is gushing over Netflix shares after the company crushed fourth-quarter subscriber expectations, but one analyst says it is time for investors to take some profits.
 Buckingham Research Group lowered its rating for Netflix shares to neutral from buy, citing concerns over the company's spending on content to boost profit down the road.
""We are confident in Netflix's position as a global streaming leader with new entrants like Disney more apt to be complements than replacements,"" analyst Matthew Harrigan wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""Nonetheless, continued share momentum depends on market confidence that NFLX's guided $3.0-4.0B in negative 2018 free cash flow will generate superior investment returns.""
 Netflix said it added 8.3 million subscribers in the fourth quarter compared with expectations for 6.4 million.

Harrigan raised his price target for Netflix shares to $257 from $251, representing 13 percent upside to Monday's close.
The analyst noted the rising risks from Netflix's well-financed media and internet competitors.
""Even CEO Reed Hastings is open kimono that the global migration to IPTV content will attract new entrants and accelerating commitments from those currently engaged, which include deep pocketed tech companies like Amazon and companies with significant programming access like Hulu and European public broadcasters,"" he wrote.
Netflix stock downgrades are a rare occurrence on Wall Street in recent years. The last time the company was downgraded was in Sept. 2016, when Macquarie lowered its rating to underperform from neutral.

 });""Stranger Things,"" ""13 Reasons Why"" and ""Bright"" were big hits on Netflix in 2017, and the company has credited marketing — as well as the content itself — for their success.
 As well as spending between $7.5 billion and $8 billion on shows, Netflix will increase its marketing expenditure to $2 billion this year, up from $1.28 billion in 2017, the company said in a shareholder letter published Monday.
But in spite of a healthy budget, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings would actually rather not spend any money on marketing at all. ""Our sort of Holy Grail dream is that the service was so good at promoting the new content in such relevant ways that we wouldn't have to spend externally,"" he said on the company's fourth quarter earnings call Monday.
 Greg Peters is Netflix's chief product officer — the man in charge of optimizing the streaming site's recommendation algorithm that encourages people to watch more shows — while Kelly Bennett is its chief marketing officer, responsible for spending that cool $2 billion budget.

Stranger Things' Dustin wearing a Brontosaurus sweatshirt crashes website.
 ""So think of it as there's a little bit of competition between Greg and Kelly Bennett's spending to see who can drive the growth of the titles most effectively,"" Hastings said on the call.
Hastings added that Netflix wants to improve ""free"" promotion for the site's shows.
""As we are right now, it still is a really good financial investment to increase on the marketing and that may continue to be so,"" he said. ""But we're always also trying to improve the product in the organic reach, social and PR of the title marketing, where you end up having to spend less on paid marketing.""
Netflix is known for its use of data to suggest content to viewers and Hastings said it experiments with how best to market shows as well.
""But we really, as you can understand, steer by the data where we're doing these city-level, country-level experiments to see what are the efficient ways and productive ways to get, say, 'Bright' viewing very large, or a title that we recently had 'The End Of The F--king World' and it's been incredible for us with not much marketing and then we're boosting on it,"" he said.
 Asked whether Netflix would run ads on its site, Hastings said not. ""It is a core differentiator and again we're having great success on the commercial-free path. That's what our brand is about. So we're going to continue to expand the relevance of a commercial free service around the world and make that so popular that consumers are very used to and appreciate Netflix.""
Traditional or ""linear"" TV is being disrupted by services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, and in turn there is also fierce competition among streaming sites. Disney is to remove its content from Netflix in 2019 and has also agreed to buy some 21st Century Fox assets, including Hulu, another Netflix rival. But Hastings said he would subscribe to Disney's service.
""I think, in particular, Disney, with its strength of brand and unique content, will have some real success. I know I'll be a subscriber of it for my own personal watching. The same way as many Disney and Fox executives also subscribe to Netflix,"" he said on the earnings call.
Disclosure: Comcast, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, is a co-owner of Hulu.

 'You'll see a lot more exciting deals,' says Baidu's president

 Baidu hinted at ""a lot more exciting deals"" to come in the video content space this year, after the Chinese internet giant inked an agreement with U.S. streaming giant Netflix to bring some of its shows to China.
 The search giant, which is often dubbed the ""Google of China,"" has a video subscription streaming service called iQiyi, which has around 400 million users. 
Last year, Netflix agreed to provide some of its content, such as ""Stranger Things,"" to iQiyi, giving the U.S. firm access to the Chinese market. 
 Stevie Young | CNBC 
 In an interview with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Baidu's President Ya-Qin Zhang, hinted at more deals to come with Netflix.
""Our head of content is working hard to bring more content to China and to produce more content,"" Zhang told CNBC in an interview. ""You'll see a lot more exciting deals.""
Baidu's core business is still in advertising, much like Alphabet-owned Google, but stricter rules around ads in China hit the business in 2016. The company has since recovered but is focusing investments around new areas such as artificial intelligence, driverless cars and video streaming.

106,2018-01-26,"Spotify and Apple Music should become record labels so musicians can make a fair living  ""Fast Money"" final trades: X, GILD, and more  ","Getty Images
Bruno Mars performs onstage at 2017 BET Awards at Microsoft Theater on June 25, 2017 in Los Angeles.
 The Grammy Awards on Sunday will feature top stars like Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars. But on ""Music's biggest night"" viewers should be reminded of just how difficult it has become for less popular artists to make a living in the digital age.
 Streaming services that we all use like Spotify and Apple Music offer great convenience to fans. But artists are getting a raw deal. The simple truth is musicians need to be paid more for their content. And if these services started to act more like record labels, they could afford to do just that.
These days, millions of listeners flock to streaming services to enjoy music that is either advertisement-supported or subscription based. Americans listened to an average of  32 hours per week in 2017, and that number is only rising.
 But musicians still aren't getting a fair shake. Here's the math: Spotify  pays about $0.006 to $0.0084 per stream to the holder of music rights. And the ""holder"" can be split among the record label, producers, artists, and songwriters. In short, streaming is a volume game.
 ""When people bought albums and even mp3s, there was a glimmer of hope that a musician could earn a decent income on sales. But now musicians are essentially giving away their music.""
 For example, Taylor Swift earned between $280,000 and $390,000 for her song ""Shake It Off"" which garnered 46.3 million streams, according to one report. But that's for one of the world's biggest pop stars. Most musicians won't generate that many streams in their life time. Another calculation  shows that 1 million plays on Spotify translates to around $7,000, and one million plays on Pandora generates $1,650.
When people bought albums and even mp3s, there was a glimmer of hope that a musician could earn a decent income on sales. But now musicians are essentially giving away their music in return for pennies.
Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming services should raise rates considerably, so that artists can make more money from their wares. No doubt this is a difficult proposition because the streaming business model isn't actually profitable.
Spotify, for example, is still losing money, despite growing 40 percent a year.
But if it can't afford to raise the payment rate, here is another option:
It can become a record label and cut exclusive deals directly with artists. In other words, Spotify and other services should disintermediate record labels that can take as much as 70 percent of the money royalties. In this regard, Spotify could emulate Netflix, which started out as a DVD rental service and eventually became an originator of content that has won several Emmys.
When Spotify was a fledgling service, it sought investments from the big record labels. But now Spotify is the big behemoth, and it can effectively replace the labels. In short, Spotify wants content, and artists want distribution. Record labels used to provide distribution. But there are almost no record stores anymore, and the whole game for musicians and songwriters is getting listed and promoted on the music streaming services.
Why does an artist need to give up 70 percent to a record label? With this new model, Spotify would own a piece of the intellectual property, and they wouldn't have to pay third-party labels. The streaming services could provide cash-advances to artists, so that musicians can make more immediate income from their work.
For example, Apple Music paid Chance the Rapper $500,000 for a two-week exclusive on his music. Streaming services could do the same for the long tail of musicians too: Imagine a talented jazz or country crooner receiving $5,000 or $20,000 to make a new project. That would be manna from heaven!  The music streaming services have the power. They should share more of it with the musicians whose work they leverage. And they might actually be able to make a profit at the same time.

""Throughout the period, subscription video-on-demand will gain ground, not only because of new service launches across the globe, but also due to a consumer switch to the idea of 'skinny bundles', or slimmed down packages which will, in some cases, mean cable companies' customers cancel their packages,"" Juniper's report stated.

 Facebook's news feed change will be huge for Twitter: Former Twitter CEO   
 12:18  PM ET Fri, 26 Jan 2018 |  03:43 
 While Facebook has recently announced changes to its news feed, meaning that content from friends is prioritized over publisher and advertiser content, live video posts are set to increase, which is an opportunity for brands.
""This content will increasingly be of interest to advertisers, especially in view of Facebook's monthly active user base of over 2 billion people. The company has launched an app and website called Facebook for Creators to help users refine video content and generate viewership,"" Juniper's Lauren Foye said in an emailed statement.
Facebook's new video tab Watch, which works rather like YouTube, will also generate further ad dollars for the social network.
Advertising spend against online video is set to grow by 130 percent to $37 billion in 2022, up from $16 billion in 2017, according to Juniper's estimates and the number of people watching video online is set to hit 4.5 billion worldwide.

But none of that mattered Monday as investors looked to sell their biggest winners in order to raise capital amid the sell-off.

President Donald Trump listens to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson during the 'American Leadership in Emerging Technology' event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on Thursday, June 22, 2017.
 President Donald Trump doesn't have a lot of friends in Silicon Valley. However, as his administration delays approving the AT&T-Time Warner merger, he is unintentionally making life much easier for the biggest technology companies. 
 The Justice Department's decision to sue to block the $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T has clogged up the future of the legacy media business as executives wait to see what's possible — and what isn't — in a Trump administration. Meanwhile, tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet's YouTube, and Facebook are free to spend billions on original content, buoyed by the rising growth that traditional media companies lack.
""For the first time, I don't understand what's possible regulatorily when it comes to horizontal integration or to vertical integration, and even whether or not behavioral remedies will be meaningful again,"" said Leo Hindery, managing partner of InterMedia Partners and the former CEO of both TCI and AT&T Broadband, once the largest U.S. cable company. ""There are now inconsistent strategies from company to company and people are stepping every day into each other's sandboxes.""
 The threat of tech giants moving in on traditional media businesses is one of the reasons Rupert Murdoch decided to sell $52.4 billion worth of 21st Century Fox assets to Disney in December, according to people familiar with the matter. That sale included Fox's movie studio, some cable channels and stakes in Sky, Endemol Shine Group and Hulu, as well as regional sports networks.

 Outlook for mergers and acquisitions market is robust going into 2018: Deutsche Bank   
 4:18  AM ET Fri, 15 Dec 2017 |  02:43 
 Murdoch is concerned the largest technology companies will outspend Fox and other TV-first programmers on new content and sports rights in the coming years, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Media companies are trying to respond by getting bigger and bulking up their balance sheets to compete.
Fox shelled out $3 billion for Thursday Night NFL rights for the next five years in a deal announced last week. The price to broadcast football games keeps rising even as NFL ratings have declined for the second consecutive season. That's because traditional TV programmers like Fox need must-see live content to differentiate from on-demand services such as Netflix, which is spending up to $8 billion on content next year alone.   
Access to sports and live events is also important to keep the cable-TV ecosystem relevant -- high-demand content drives cable's bundling strategy, where it sells large groups of channels together. Total U.S. households paying for cable or satellite TV could fall to 92 million in 2018, according to a UBS estimate, down 11 percent from 2012, when pay-TV households peaked at 103 million. 
The combined market valuations of the big legacy media companies like Comcast, Disney, Fox and Time Warner is about $500 billion. That collective number trails the individual market caps of Apple, Amazon and Facebook.
Apple's market valuation, by itself, is around $830 billion. Amazon's is approaching $700 billion. Facebook is around $550 billion. Netflix's market cap, which is around $115 billion, tops both Fox and Time Warner.
 A brake on other deals
 Blocking AT&T-Time Warner has put the brakes on a series of domino deals that would drastically consolidate the media landscape. 
If AT&T-Time Warner isn't allowed to proceed, Time Warner, which owns HBO, CNN, Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. studio, will almost certainly look for a new merger partner. AT&T will also be forced to alter its strategy of vertical integration.
It's conceivable Disney may not be allowed to buy Fox either, though Trump did publicly congratulate Murdoch on the deal when it was announced, suggesting his approval. 
If AT&T-Time Warner is able to move forward, Verizon immediately becomes another potential buyer of big media. 
Comcast, CNBC's owner, could also consider topping Disney's bid for Fox, according to people familiar with the matter. No decision has been made by Comcast on a topping bid yet, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision is private. Disney is already preparing itself for a Comcast topping bid and considering responses in case, according to multiple people familiar with Disney's thinking. 
An unsolicited offer at a premium to Disney's bid could persuade enough Fox shareholders to vote against Murdoch. His family controls 39 percent of Fox's Class B voting shares but owns only 17 percent of all outstanding shares. Comcast executives suggested to Murdoch last year they would be willing to pay significantly more for Fox's assets than what Disney was offering, said the people. Murdoch still went with the Disney offer, in large part due to regulatory concerns with Comcast. 
Fox's international businesses are of particular interest to Comcast, which sees more potential growth outside of the U.S. than it does domestically. Spokeswomen for Comcast and Fox declined to comment.
""Many of our peers are re-evaluating their strategies,"" Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said during the company's Jan. 24 earnings call. ""So along the way, there may be opportunities for us to create more value for our shareholders, like we did with NBCUniversal. In this respect, it shouldn't be a surprise that we study every situation that comes along.""
Even if the U.S. district court upholds the Justice Department's decision to block the deal, Time Warner could sue again, bringing the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. That decision could be more than a year away, causing the media landscape to remain frozen for years.
""For the longest time, we had decades of very successful vertical integration, with common finish lines for the whole of the media and telecommunications industries,"" Hindery said. ""Not anymore.""
 Family planning
 Beyond the fear of Silicon Valley's impending takeover of live and original content, companies including Fox, CBS and Viacom are also looking for regulatory clarity so their majority owners can clear up estate planning issues. 
Murdoch's decision to shed Fox assets puts his son Lachlan in place to run the smaller Fox, according to a person familiar with Murdoch's thinking. It also allows his other son, James, the freedom to move away from the business if he chooses, the person said.

 Shari Redstone also isn't waiting for Time Warner, even though CBS and Time Warner could be natural merger candidates.
Sumner Redstone's daughter took control of her 94-year-old father's media empire, National Amusements, last year as his health declined. National Amusements owns about 80 percent of the common stock of CBS and Viacom. Redstone is now considering putting the companies back together after a false start last year.
John Malone has successfully orchestrated two programming mergers in just over a year, putting together Lionsgate and Starz in December 2016 and championing Discovery's decision to acquire Scripps last year. Malone controls about 28 percent of Discovery's voting shares. Lionsgate, now combined with Starz, may look for a larger buyer later this year, although it isn't yet in formal sales talks, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
The sudden push for massive media consolidation is largely driven by the realization that the media ecosystem is shifting from television to the Internet, even if the cable subscription model allows legacy media companies to profitably survive. Still, after decades of pushing for higher affiliate fees from TV operators, such as Comcast, Charter and Dish Network, TV programmers are now banding together to ensure their most popular channels survive and drive growth.
""In the opening scene of 'March of the Penguins,' the penguins are huddling up to get warm in a pack so large so that they can withstand the harshness of winter and survive a little bit longer,"" said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG who covers the media industry. ""This is what's happening to legacy media companies. They are banding together, trying to stay alive to survive another winter.""
Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

 4:46  PM ET Mon,  5 Feb 2018 |  02:16 
 It was a rough day for growth technology investors. So-called FANG stocks lost more than $90 billion in stock value Monday. 
 FANG stocks are a basket of high-growth technology stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) that have led the bull run of the last 9 years.
 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet shares all fell during the dramatic market decline Monday ranging from a drop of 2.8 percent to a 5.1 percent fall.
Alphabet was the biggest loser at $39.5 billion in value lost. The total stock value lost from FANG stocks was $90.7 billion.Even after the sharp drops Monday, all the FANG stocks are up so far this year. Netflix is still up more than 30 percent year-to-date after its strong December quarter results, followed by Amazon's 19 percent year-to-date gain.

 Disney CEO: Young people are subscribing to traditional, cheaper cable packages   
 7:23  PM ET Tue,  6 Feb 2018 |  01:59 
 Disney Chairman and CEO Bob Iger said the company's yet-to-be-launched direct-to-consumer service will be able to hold its own against streaming giant Netflix.
 The Walt Disney Company is home to box office powerhouses Marvel, Pixar and ""Star Wars."" In an earnings call on Tuesday, Iger explained that Disney doesn't need to spend a lot on trial and error to make hit content for its new service because it already owns the rights to such valuable properties.
""When you go to market with ""Star Wars"" movies, Disney movies, Pixar movies, Marvel-branded and branded television shows under those umbrellas ... that will give us the ability to probably spend less than if we had gone to market with a direct-to-consumer service without these brands,"" Iger said.
 Disney knows it already has shows and movies that consumers want and are actively seeking. By making those exclusively available on its streaming service, Disney doesn't face the same pressure to outbid other companies in the content spending race. In January, Netflix said it plans on spending between  $7.5 billion and $8 billion on content in 2018 alone.
Instead, the entertainment giant can focus on developing its existing franchises and originals. In August, Disney said it would be pulling its movies from Netflix in 2019, when it plans to launch its own streaming platform. The news sent Netflix shares down 4 percent in extended trading.
Besides the nostalgic benefits of Disney's original movies, there's plenty of new content on the horizon. Iger said Tuesday that ""Black Panther"" ticket presales were ""outpacing every other superhero movie ever made, driven in part to the phenomenal reaction to the premiere last week.""

 FANG stocks can stabilize amid volatility   
 7:45  PM ET Tue,  6 Feb 2018 |  00:59 
 After several days of a rapid-fire sell-off that rattled global markets, CNBC's Jim Cramer and technician Bob Lang took to the charts to prove that some stocks are still worth investors' time.
 Lang, the founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and one of the three market minds behind TheStreet.com's Trifecta Stocks newsletter, specifically called attention to four of the market's most recognizable names.
""Here's the thing: almost exactly five years ago, Lang had this idea for a cute acronym that would sum up the hottest growth stocks around, FANG — short for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, which has since become Alphabet,"" Cramer said. ""I liked the idea so much that I shamelessly adopted it. Some would even go so far as to say I stole it.""
 The ""Mad Money"" host admitted that the FANG stocks, like most, were not immune to the market-wide sell-off. All four stocks fell hard in the last week, only starting to pare their losses on Tuesday.
But in the last five years, their gains have been staggering, Cramer noted: Facebook is up 547 percent, Amazon has run 441 percent, Netflix has surged 967 percent and Alphabet has tacked on 183 percent.
In comparison, the Nasdaq gained 124 percent over the same time frame and the S&P 500 climbed 78 percent — not bad, but weak compared to FANG, Cramer said.
""More importantly, for the last five years, FANG has been incredibly resilient. As Lang points out, the so-called experts tried to crush these stories over and over again,"" Cramer said. ""None of it really mattered. Every time, FANG bounced back.""
So as investors reevaluate their holdings amid wild market volatility, Cramer and Lang took to the charts of each FANG stock to determine whether the tech titans could have even more upside.
 Facebook
 First up was the daily chart of social media giant Facebook. After making a series of higher highs and higher lows, a typically bullish sign, shares of Facebook tanked on Monday, pulling back to $180.
 Facebook's stock even grazed the $177 level on Tuesday before settling at $185, but Lang pointed out that its floor of support just under $180 has held true three times since the fall.
""Will it bounce again? Lang thinks so,"" Cramer said. ""He likes that the Chaikin Money Flow, which measures the level of buying and selling pressure in a stock, has remained positive ... indicating the big institutions still have an appetite for Facebook. Put it all together and he wouldn't be surprised if Facebook can make a move to $200 in the not-too-distant future.""
 Amazon
 Next, Cramer and Lang turned to the daily chart of Amazon, the e-commerce colossus involved in everything from food retail to entertainment to, most recently, health care.
 Amazon shares declined dramatically on Monday, but only after a staggering run, Cramer said. Just over three months ago, Amazon's stock was at $970 a share. Now, it's hovering at $1,442 a share.
The online retailer also reported earnings last Thursday after the market closed, causing the stock to surge by over $100 a share on Friday despite the beginnings of the sell-off.
""Lang likes that the Chaikin Money Flow has stayed strong here, and he also likes that the stock's recent rally happened on strong volume,"" Cramer said. ""There's really a lot to like with Amazon, which is why Lang sees it making a run to $1,500.""
 Netflix
 After spending much of January soaring to new highs, shares of Netflix dropped in recent sessions along with the rest of FANG.
 But Lang noted that Netflix's declines happened on lower volume, an indicator technicians use to determine whether a move is deserved or not. Weak volume means the move could be ""lying,"" Cramer said.
""Meanwhile, Netflix has a nice floor of support at its 20-day moving average, currently at $242, and the Chaikin Money Flow is still very high, meaning the big institutions continue to lap this stock up,"" Cramer said. ""Lang believes Netflix can go from $265, where it is now, to $300.""
 Alphabet
 Finally, Cramer turned to the daily chart of Google parent Alphabet.
 Shares of Alphabet took a nosedive after the company's weaker-than-expected earnings report last Thursday, sinking even more at the start of this week.
""This is the one FANG component that Lang's not feeling quite so sanguine about,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Lang noticed that the stock's moving average convergence divergence indicator, or MACD, which helps technicians spot changes in a stock's path before they happen, recently made a bearish move, depicted on the chart by the black line crossing below the red.
The MACD tends to be a reliable indicator, but Cramer pointed out that Alphabet's money flow was still strong. Still, all things considered, Lang came out fairly bearish on Alphabet.
""Put it all together and Lang could see Alphabet bottoming out at the current levels,"" Cramer said. ""He thinks the $1,050 level would be a buying opportunity, and if the stock can settle down a bit, he wouldn't be surprised if it can head back to $1,200. But he says it's probably going to $1,050 first.""
 Final thoughts
 ""For five years, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet survived everything that the bears had to throw at them, and each time they came out stronger than before,"" Cramer said. ""The charts, as interpreted by the incredible Bob Lang, suggest that this time may be no different. He does expect Alphabet to pull back some more before it can find its footing. But as for Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, he's optimistic. Me? I remain a FANG stalwart.""

 AT&T CEO: We feel good about the Time Warner case   
 9:13  AM ET Fri,  9 Feb 2018 |  02:48 
 AT&T Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson said Friday it makes no sense for the government to oppose the telecommunications giant's $85 billion buyout of Time Warner on the grounds that content distributors and content creators under the same umbrella would be anti-competitive.
 He said major technology firms such as Netflix and Amazon are allowed to do the same thing.
""Reality is, the biggest distributor of content out there is totally vertically integrated. This happens to be something called Netflix. But they create original content; they aggregate original content; and they distribute original content. They have 100 million subscribers,"" Stephenson said on CNBC. ""Look at Amazon. They're doing the exact same thing. Amazon Studios, creating, aggregating, distributing; Google, YouTube, Hulu, this thing is prolific."" 
 AT&T has long-maintained that buying Time Warner is what's called a vertical merger, meaning AT&T's mobile network, satellite TV service DirecTV and high-speed internet solutions don't directly compete with any of Time Warner's businesses. 
AT&T is preparing to face off in court next month against the Justice Department, which in November filed a lawsuit to block the deal. The DOJ has argued the merger combining Time Warner's content-generating properties including HBO, CNN, Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. studio would give AT&T the ability and incentive to raise prices that it charges cable television, satellite and streaming video rivals for Time Warner content.
 The company is in litigation with hearings and depositions going on, said Stephenson, who appeared on ""Squawk Box"" in an interview from Pebble Beach, California, site of the AT&T Pro-Am golf tournament. He said the judge set to preside over the March 19 trial has committed to a quick proceeding.
Stephenson has been a supporter of Donald Trump during the campaign and as president. However, then-candidate Trump attacked the deal, which was announced in October 2016.
One day after last year's DOJ suit, Trump reiterated his feeling that the deal would not be good for the country because it might lead to higher prices for consumers. Trump has certainly made no secret of his disdain for Time Warner's CNN, which he has repeatedly called ""fake news.""
On Thursday, four House Democrats wrote the Justice Department to request documents related to the agency's suit to block the merger. ""We are deeply concerned by reports of inappropriate interference by the White House,"" said the letter signed by Reps. Jerrold Nadler, Elijah Cummings, David Cicilline and Gerald Connolly.
On AT&T's earnings conference call last month, Stephenson said, ""With 50 years of legal precedent, it's the type of business combination that the government has consistently approved with appropriate conditions."" He added that closing the Time Warner deal remains a top priority.

 Trader Josh Brown on how to deal with sell-offs   
 2:59  PM ET Fri,  9 Feb 2018 |  02:15 
 Josh Brown says investors can take advantage of big market declines by using a simple trading strategy.
 The S&P 500 fell officially into correction territory on Thursday, down more than 10 percent from its record reached in January. 
""One of the things that I do when we get into a situation like this ... I put ludicrously low bids in, in the stocks I either don't own enough of, or I just totally missed out and it always made me upset,"" Brown said Friday on CNBC's ""Halftime Report."" 
 Brown explained that he uses good 'til canceled (GTC) buy limit orders, which aren't executed until the stock hits his preset price.
""So I'm not just randomly flinging in a trade when I feel like it. I will set the number where I want to own it,"" he said. ""And usually I won't get hit, but it makes me start to root for the market to get lower.""
