0,2017-07-07,This former Google[X] exec is building a high-tech hat that she says will make telepathy possible in 8 years  Google is helping fund AI news writers in the UK and Ireland  This former Google[X] exec is developing a technology that she says will make telepathy possible in 8 years  ,"Imagine if telepathy were real. If, for example, you could transmit your thoughts to a computer or to another person just by thinking them.
 In just eight years it will be, says Openwater founder Mary Lou Jepsen, thanks to technology her company is working on.
Jepsen is a former engineering executive at Facebook, Oculus, Google[x] (now called X) and Intel. She's also been a professor at MIT and is an inventor on over 100 patents. And that's the abbreviated version of her resume.
 Jepsen left Facebook to found Openwater in 2016. The San Francisco-based start-up is currently building technology to make medical imaging less expensive.
""I figured out how to put basically the functionality of an M.R.I. machine — a multimillion-dollar M.R.I. machine — into a wearable in the form of a ski hat,"" Jepson tells CNBC, though she does not yet have a prototype completed.

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 So what does that hat have to do with telepathy? 
Current M.R.I. technology can already see your thoughts: ""If I threw [you] into an M.R.I. machine right now ... I can tell you what words you're about to say, what images are in your head. I can tell you what music you're thinking of,"" says Jepsen. ""That's today, and I'm talking about just shrinking that down.""
One day Jepsen's tech hat could ""literally be a thinking cap,"" she says. Jepsen says the goal is for the technology to be able to both read and to output your own thoughts, as well as read the thoughts of others. In iconic Google vocabulary, ""the really big moonshot idea here is communication with thought — with telepathy,"" says Jepsen.
 ""The really big moonshot idea here is communication with thought — with telepathy.""
-Mary Lou Jepsen, founder and CEO of Openwater
 Traditional M.R.I., or magnetic resonance imaging, uses magnetic fields and radio waves to take images of internal organs. Openwater's technology instead looks at the flow of oxygen in a person's body illuminated with benign, infrared light, which will make it more compact and cheaper.
""Our bodies are translucent to that light. The light can get into your head,"" says Jepsen, in an interview with Kara Swisher of Recode.
If Jepsen is right and one day ideas will be instantly shared or digitized, that would significantly speed up the process of creating, learning and communicating. Today, it takes time to share an idea, whether by talking about it or writing it down. But telepathy would make all of that instantaneous.
""Right now our output is basically moving our jaws and our tongues or typing [with] our fingers. We're ... limited to this very low output rate from our brains, and what if we could up that through telepathy?"" asks Jepsen.

 Instant transfer of thoughts would also speed up the innovation process. Imagine being a filmmaker or a writer and being able to download the dream you had last night. Or, she suggests, what if all you had to do was think of an idea for a new product, download your thought and then send the digital version of your thought to a 3-D printer?  
""That makes our iteration cycle so much faster,"" says Jepsen.
Jepsen is not the only one dreaming of communication by thought. Earlier this year, Elon Musk launched Neuralink, a company aiming to merge our brains with computing power, though with a different approach.
""Elon Musk is talking about silicon nanoparticles pulsing through our veins to make us sort of semi-cyborg computers,"" says Jepsen. But why not take a noninvasive approach? ""I've been working and trying to think and invent a way to do this for a number of years and finally happened upon it and left Facebook to do it.""
Talk of telepathy cannot happen without imagining the ethical implications. If wearing a hat would make it possible to read thoughts, then: ""Can the police make you wear such a hat? Can the military make you wear such a hat? Can your parents make you wear such a hat?"" asks Jepsen.
What if your boss wanted you to wear a telepathy hat at the office?
""We have to answer these questions, so we're trying to make the hat only work if the individual wants it to work, and then filtering out parts that the person wearing it doesn't feel it's appropriate to share.""

 Google is giving the Press Association news agency  a grant of €706,000 ($806,000) to start writing stories with the help of artificial intelligence. The money is coming out of the tech giant's Digital News Initiative fund, which supports digital journalism in Europe. The PA supplies news stories to media outlets all over the UK and Ireland, and will be working with a startup named Urbs Media to produce 30,000 local stories a month with the help of AI.
The editor-in-chief of the Press Association, Peter Clifton, explained to The Guardian that the AI articles will be the product of collaboration with human journalists. Writers will create ""detailed story templates"" for topics like crime, health, and unemployment, and Urbs Media's Radar tool (it stands for Reporters And Data And Robots) will fill in the blanks and helping localize each article. This sort of workflow has been used by media outlets for years, with the Los Angeles Times using AI to write news stories about earthquakes since 2014.
""Skilled human journalists will still be vital in the process,"" said Clifton, ""but Radar allows us to harness artificial intelligence to scale up to a volume of local stories that would be impossible to provide manually.""

The money from Google will also be used to make tools for scraping information from public databases in the UK, like those generated by local councils and the National Health Service. The Radar software will also auto-generate graphics for stories, as well as add relevant videos and pictures. The software will start being used from the beginning of next year.
Some reporters in the UK, though, are skeptical about the new scheme. Tim Dawson, president of the National Union of Journalists, told The Guardian: ""The real problem in the media is too little bona fide reporting. I don't believe that computer whizzbangery is going to replace that. What I'm worried about in my capacity as president of the NUJ is something that ends up with third-rate stories which look as if they are something exciting, but are computer-generated so [news organizations] can get rid of even more reporters.""

1,2017-07-10,Newspapers to bid for antitrust exemption to tackle Google and Facebook  Facebook and Google are both building more affordable housing in Silicon Valley  Google launched an initiative to improve how users work with artificial intelligence  ,"Dan Kitwood | Getty Images
In this photo illustration a selection of UK national newspapers are displayed together on October 30, 2013 in London, England.
 The news industry is to band together to seek a limited antitrust exemption from Congress in an effort to fend off growing competition from Facebook and Google.
 Traditional competitors including The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, as well as a host of smaller print and online publications, will temporarily set aside their differences this week and appeal to federal lawmakers to let them negotiate collectively with the technology giants to safeguard the industry.
Antitrust laws traditionally prevent companies from forming such an alliance which could see them becoming over-dominant in a particular sector. However, the media companies will be hoping that Congress will look favorably on a temporary exemption, particularly giving the recent clampdown on the technology industry which saw Google slapped with a $2.7 billion antitrust fine.
 The campaign is led by newspaper industry trade group News Media Alliance and it is intended to help the industry collaborate in order to regain market share from Facebook and Google, which have been swooping in on newspapers' distribution and advertising revenues.
The two companies currently command 70 percent of the $73 billion digital advertising industry in the U.S., according to new research from the Pew Research Centre. Meanwhile, U.S. newspaper ad revenue in 2016 was $18 billion from $50 billion a decade ago.

 The News Media Alliance argue that, despite their growing dominance in news distribution, Facebook and Google lack the resources and ability to guarantee the accuracy of reporting upheld by reputable news associations. Facebook in particular came under fire during the 2016 U.S. presidential election when it failed to suitably monitor the news content on its platform and was seen to host unverified articles.
""(Facebook and Google) don't employ reporters: They don't dig through public records to uncover corruption, send correspondents into war zones, or attend last night's game to get the highlights. They expect an economically squeezed news industry to do that costly work for them,"" David Chavern, president and chief executive of the News Media Alliance, wrote in anopinion piece published Sunday in the Wall Street Journal.
""The only way publishers can address this inexorable threat is by banding together,"" he continued.
""If they open a unified front to negotiate with Google and Facebook — pushing for stronger intellectual-property protections, better support for subscription models and a fair share of revenue and data — they could build a more sustainable future for the news business.""
Chavern added that antitrust laws are currently ""insulating"" Google and Facebook from market forces, but said that news publishers remain committed to ""unleashing those forces to defend their investments in great journalism.""

 When contacted by CNBC Monday, Facebook's head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, said the business, which recently celebrated 2 billion users, was committed to aiding quality journalism.
""We're committed to helping quality journalism thrive on Facebook. We're making progress through our work with news publishers and have more work to do,"" Brown said via email.
Google added that it wanted to support the news industry's continued transition towards digital.
""We want to help news publishers succeed as they transition to digital. In recent years we've built numerous specialized products and technologies, developed specifically to help distribute, fund, and support newspapers. This is a priority and we remain deeply committed to helping publishers with both their challenges, and their opportunities,"" a Google spokesperson told CNBC via email.

 });One day, Facebook employees will only have to cross the street to commute to the tech giant's Menlo Park headquarters. 
 In a blog post on Friday, Facebook announced plans to turn the 56-acre Menlo Science & Technology Park it bought in 2015 into a company town, dubbed the Willow Campus. Located across the street from the company's current campus, it will include a grocery store, pharmacy and shopping center.
""Working with the community, our goal for the Willow Campus is to create an integrated, mixed-use village that will provide much needed services, housing and transit solutions as well as office space,"" Facebook writes.
 Of the 1,500 new housing units the company plans to build, 15 percent will be affordable, priced below the market rate. The village won't be comprised of only Facebook employees, either. Facebook will open up the units to the community at large,  Business Insider reports.

 Affordable housing is much needed in the Bay Area, where prices have reached such insane heights that some Facebook engineers reportedly asked Mark Zuckerberg for help paying rent and some Twitter employees earning $160,000 can feel like they're barely scraping by. Even some residents making six-figures can qualify as ""low-income"" and receive housing subsidies.

 ""These efforts complement our ongoing work to address the [housing] issue, including the  Catalyst Housing Fund for affordable housing we established in partnership with community groups to fund affordable housing for our local area,"" Facebook writes.
It's worth noting, however, that prominent tech companies such as Facebook are in some ways responsible for the crisis they're now facing. As Quartz's Frederick Kuo reports, San Francisco's thriving technology industry has spurred economic growth, and the housing market can't keep up.
""The strength of recent job growth combined with policies that have traditionally limited housing development in the city and throughout the peninsula has proven to be a perfect recipe for an affordability crisis,"" Kuo writes. ""In 2015 alone,  the Bay Area added 64,000 in jobs; in the same year, only 5,000 new homes were built."" 
 A rendering for Facebook's ""Willow Campus"" development in Menlo Park, California.
 Another Silicon Valley heavyweight is attempting a solution as well. Google's parent company, Alphabet, is paying about $30 million to provide temporary, prefab housing for 300 of its employees.
According to  The Wall Street Journal, Alphabet is making a significant investment in modular housing built and shipped in from elsewhere by the start-up Factory OS, because the current local offerings are so overpriced: ""San Francisco rents have jumped by almost 50 percent since 2010, while home prices have increased 98 percent since the bottom of the market in 2009.""
But rents for Alphabet's apartments are expected to be more moderate. Factory OS founder and CEO Rick Holliday tells the Journal that ""a previous project that Holliday built using modular technology saved tenants $700 a month in rent because of reduced construction costs.""

 The concept of a company town is nothing new. These insular communities first began cropping up during the Industrial Revolution, as corporations such as Hershey chocolate and Corning glass tried to ""woo workers with fancy amenities,""  Smithsonian reports.
While some company towns encapsulated the picturesque ""American Dream,"" others festered with poverty and abuse from bare-bones housing and harsh working conditions. In many textile, coal and steel towns, employees  earned company credit in place of actual wages, which was only valid for use in high-priced company stores.
While modern-day examples of company towns can offer better conditions, it's still unclear if they're the answer to the housing crisis plaguing Silicon Valley.

 Alphabet on Monday said it has kicked off a new research initiative aimed at improving human interaction with artificial intelligence systems.
 The People + AI Research (PAIR) program currently encompasses a dozen people who will collaborate with Googlers in various product groups — as well as outsiders like Harvard University professor Brendan Meade and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Hal Abelson.
The research could eventually lead to refinements in the interfaces of the smarter components of some of the world's most popular apps. And Google's efforts here could inspire other companies to adjust their software, too.
 ""One of the things we're going to be looking into is this notion of explanation — what might be a useful on-time, on-demand explanation about why a recommendation system did something it did,"" Google Brain senior staff research scientist Fernanda Viegas told CNBC in an interview.
The PAIR program takes inspiration from the concept of design thinking, which highly prioritizes the needs of people who will use the products being developed.
While end users — such as YouTube's 1.5 billion monthly users — can be the target of that, the research is also meant to improve the experience of working with AI systems for AI researchers, software engineers and domain experts as well, Google Brain senior staff research scientist Martin Wattenberg told CNBC.
The new initiative fits in well with Google's increasing focus on AI. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the world is transitioning from being mobile-first to AI-first, and the company has been taking many steps around that thesis. Recently, for example, Google formed a venture capital group to invest in AI start-ups.
Meanwhile Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft have been active in AI in the past few years as well.
As for design, that isn't new to Google, either. The company implemented a redesign for several of its apps in 2011 and in more recent years has been sprucing up many of its properties with its material design principles. And in 2016 John Maeda, then the design partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, pointed out in his annual report on design in technology that Google had been perceived as improving the most in design.
What is new is that Googlers are trying to figure out how to improve design specifically for AI components. And that's important because AI is used in a whole lot of places around Google apps, even if you might not always realize it. Video recommendations in YouTube, translations in Google Translate, article suggestions in the Google mobile app and, yes, even Google search results are all enhanced with AI.

 In July 2016, when I wrote an op-ed for the 10th anniversary of CNBC's America's Top States for Business series, I talked about how our state is slashing red tape and embracing the new economy.
What a difference a year makes.
 Since then, Google  began offering Arizonans rides in their own self-driving Waymo vehicles. Airbnb hosts in our state  earned more than $50 million throughout the year. And an array of first-class companies — from  Vector Space Systems to  Orbital ATK and many others — have expanded their presence here.
 A Google Waymo self-driving Lexus on the road in Arizona
 Three-hundred days of sunshine per year certainly helps, but it's not just the beautiful weather and panoramic mountain views that convince companies to relocate. It's a combination of Arizona's top-shelf quality of life and the pro-growth environment we've fostered over the past few years to make our state a great place to do business.
Just to name three:
 A highly trained workforce: We know what it takes to train the future. The  newest rankings from U.S. News & World Report found that Arizona is home to the top three public high schools in the country. We're making major investments in our universities, too, including a  $1 billion financing package that will allow them to make critical research infrastructure improvements to stay ahead of the competition. We also announced an initiative last year to equip  at least 60 percent of adults in our state with a certificate or degree by the year 2030 so Arizonans they have the tools they need to succeed in our quickly-changing economy. With Arizona State University being  ranked the most innovative university in the U.S. for two years in a row now (beating out MIT and Stanford), you know we're on the right track and moving forward fast. A 21st-century government: Some states have a regulatory system that reacts to innovation; in Arizona, we anticipate and embrace it so that new technologies have to catch up with legislation instead of the other way around. Whether that's an  executive order paving the way for research into self-driving technology or a  revamp of our revenue system to make home-sharing easier, we're always looking forward so that entrepreneurs can do what they do best without running into an unnecessary bureaucratic speed bump. It also means eliminating burdensome and outdated regulations already on the books, which is why we unveiled ""Regulation Rollback"" in January with the goal of soliciting input about which regulations to cut and then eliminating 500 by the end of this year. Strong international relationships: ""Trade is not a problem to solve. It's an issue to focus on and expand."" That was my closing remark to an audience in Washington, D.C., at a  discussion about the U.S.–Mexico relationship. Since taking office, I have made it a priority to strengthen Arizona's relationship with elected officials and business leaders in Mexico, and other countries, in order to bring more jobs, manufacturing, and exporting power to our region. The relationship put our state over the top when Lucid Motors was deciding where to locate its new  $700 million electric vehicle manufacturing facility a few months ago, with Lucid Motors specifically citing our ""strong regional supply chain"" and ""proximity to rail, major interstates, ports, training facilities, [and] utility providers.""Sonora Gov. Claudia Pavlovich and I are also working together with the hope of creating a  new cruise-ship port at Puerto Peñasco. International economic activity, and the relationships that foster it, can be a huge boost for businesses looking to expand, and Arizona is helping to make that happen. 
You don't need to take my word that our state is the place to be. People are seeing our low-tax, commonsense regulatory environment, and they're voting with their feet.
 Lucid Motors director of manufacturing, Brian Barron, speaking at the Arizona State Capitol about plans to build a $700 million electric vehicle manufacturing plant.
 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our own Maricopa County is the single  fastest-growing county in the United States, adding more than 222 people per day in 2016. This year, Phoenix officially reclaimed the title of the  fifth-largest city in the country, too.
Companies are doing the same. We've seen a number of major job announcements over the past few months alone, including  Constant Aviation in May and  Benchmark Electronics, which is relocating its corporate headquarters to Arizona from Texas. In fact, hiring for finance and insurance jobs grew faster in Arizona than in any other state in the country over the 12 months leading to March 2017.
That's no accident.
Arizona has been  nationally recognized for its economic competitiveness, including recently in two prominent trade publications. We were given the 2017 Gold Shovel Award in Area Development's list of top states for economic development in the five- to eight-million population category, and we were named the No. 1 most competitive state in the mountain region in Site Selection's 2017 Prosperity Cup.
In other words, when entrepreneurs get sick of being overtaxed and overregulated in places like California, they pack up a U-Haul (another great company based here) and move to Arizona.

 That's also why Texas was recently named by CNBC as the Top State of the Decade, the ""Top of the Tops"" for business.
Restrained government, lower taxes, smarter regulations, right-to-work laws and litigation reform — these are the pro-growth economic policies that help free enterprise flourish and that attract major employers to Texas every day.

 As the 10th-largest economy among the nations of the world and home to 50 Fortune 500 headquarters, Texas offers a business-friendly climate — with no corporate income tax and no personal income tax — along with a highly skilled workforce, easy access to global markets, robust infrastructure and predictable regulations. Texas offers a framework where innovation, technology and diverse industries thrive.
As a result, more Texans have jobs today than ever before. In fact, more Texans are working than 46 other states have residents.

""Made in Texas"" is a powerful label, and the Lone Star State is the top-exporting state, now for 15 years in row, and the top tech-exporting state, again beating second-place California. Texas also has the second-largest labor force, and our population continues to expand following a wave of corporate and regional headquarters relocations as businesses flee states that overtax and overregulate.
Even with the drop in oil production last year, the Texas economy grew. In fact, in terms of real GDP annualized growth, Texas was the fastest-growing state in the fourth quarter. This resiliency is a testament to the diversity of the economy and the state's tremendous economic momentum.
CEOs who relocate to Texas cite the differences as night and day when it comes to the improved quality of life and good schools, along with the job-ready workforce. Lower energy costs, together with lower land costs and fewer land-use restrictions, mean lower operating costs for businesses and a lower cost-of-living for their employees.

 ""From biotech and defense tech to wearable tech and clean tech, technologies developed in the Lone Star State are changing the world in which we live.""
 Those are some of the advantages that helped Texas win the Governor's Cup for the most new and expanded corporate facility projects in the nation — for the fifth year in a row. Over the past year, Texas welcomed Kubota Tractors, Farmer Brothers and Serenova, along with new facilities for Amazon, Facebook and GM Financial, to name just a few. Tech giants Apple, Oracle, Google and Microsoft are also expanding their corporate presence and jobs in Texas' innovation corridor.
In fact, Texas is in the middle of an innovation renaissance. From biotech and defense tech to wearable tech and clean tech, technologies developed in the Lone Star State are changing the world in which we live.
Texas is also where the tech talent wants to live, with Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas ranking among the top metro areas for startup activity.
The Texas model is proof that limited government secures economic liberty and encourages unlimited opportunity.
To spur even greater economic expansion, I will continue to fight back against overregulation by the federal government and rein in regulatory regimes at the local level that create a patchwork of compliance complexities.
The freedom to experiment with new business models, like transportation network companies, should be permitted by default. Across industries, we need to remove barriers to entry, encourage competition, enact consistent consumer safety regulations and then empower consumers to choose.
By unleashing the power of entrepreneurs and innovators, and securing the freedom to aspire, Texas will long remain the best state for business.

Sundar Pichai, Google CEO
 Alphabet has officially launched Gradient Ventures, a new firm within Google that will invest in early-stage artificial intelligence start-ups. 
 The announcement on Tuesday is the latest sign of Alphabet's growing interest in AI, a futuristic technology that's also gaining significance at Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft.  Axios reported on the new program in May, but the details were not yet public.
Gradient will invest in 10 to 15 deals this year and will typically commit $1 million to $8 million in each, said Anna Patterson, founder and managing director of the firm.
 ""If we're really going to help AI happen faster, we needed to be more involved in the community,"" said Patterson, who's spent about a decade at Google working on Android, search, advertising and AI.  ""That's why we decided to do this -- to spur innovation in the AI space."" 
But Gradient isn't just another Silicon Valley funding source for start-ups, or even a typical corporate venture capital group. Alphabet already has GV (formerly Google Ventures), which backs start-ups at all stages, and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital), which invests in later-stage companies.

 Google's artificial intelligence win   
 9:35  AM ET Wed,  9 March 2016 |  02:23 
 Gradient portfolio companies will have the opportunity to receive advanced AI training from Google. They can also have a Google engineer work onsite and provide assistance as needed for a set period of time, said Patterson.
""If you go to an AI conference now, when start-ups talk, they get up there and they say kind of heroic things about how they've acquired talent,"" Patterson said. ""I realized that we could really help there.""
The details haven't been fully ironed out, but the idea is to have a Google engineer do a rotation for six months -- or perhaps longer if a project needs more time -- and potentially have the engineer split time across multiple portfolio companies.
 Anna Patterson, founder and managing partner of Google's Gradient Ventures.
 Patterson, who spent three years as co-founder and president of search start-up Cuil, said that Google engineers ""would love to have a super-productive break."" 
Start-ups already participating in the program include Aurima, Cape, Cogniac and Dyndrite. Last month, Algorithmia said it received backing from Google's AI venture group, although the name of the firm had yet to be revealed.
Another perk is that portfolio companies will be able to access vast swaths of training data that Google has accumulated to train their own AI systems.
That's a meaningful perk for Cape, a start-up that runs an online service for remotely controlling drones. The additional data will help Cape in its security and asset inspection work, said Louis Gresham, the company's co-founder and operating chief.
Google is the sole investor in Gradient. GV did 63 deals last year, while CapitalG did six, according to data from PitchBook. Ankit Jain and Shabih Rizvi are Gradient's other partners. 
While some start-ups will surely welcome the extra help that comes with having a Google engineer temporarily on board, others might be concerned about compromising their valuable intellectual property.
Patterson stressed that there will be an agreement expressly forbidding Google employees from bringing that IP back in-house. And Patterson said that seasoned entrepreneurs are welcoming the Google help.
""The pitch has resonated more with more experienced entrepreneurs,"" she said.

Louis Vuitton smartwatch
 Louis Vuitton just announced a range of ""Tamour Horizon"" smartwatches that run on Google's Android Wear software.
 It's the most recent luxury brand to launch a smartwatch running Google's software. Others, such as Tag Heuer and Montblanc also sell high-end smartwatches. Each Louis Vuitton watch features a watchface with the company's branding, as well as premium metals and wrist straps — some of which employ Louis Vuitton's distinct leather patterns. 
Like all Android Wear smartwatches, the Louis Vuitton Tamour Horizon series is capable of providing alerts from your smartphone, such as incoming text messages and phone calls, and can help track of the number of steps you take each day. Thousands of watch apps are available through Google's app store to add additional functionality to the watches.
 Louis Vuitton's website didn't list prices, but The New York Times said they range from $2,450 to $2,900.

 });Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at the Google I/O developer conference on May 17, 2017.
 Google has paid researchers and academics who have worked on projects that support the company's positions in battles with regulators, a report in The Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday.
Google's practice might not sound all that different from lobbying, but The Wall Street Journal revealed that some of the professors, including a Paul Heald from the University of Illinois, didn't disclose Google's payments. Heald is one of ""more than a dozen"" such professors who accepted money from Google, according to The Wall Street Journal.
 Google has reason to try to get as many folks on its side as it can. The company has faced almost constant scrutiny for its business practices, most recently a record antitrust fine of $2.7 billion in the European Union. Tens of thousands of dollars to professors here and there could have helped it avoid that fine, and others.
""Ever since Google was born out of Stanford's Computer Science department, we've maintained strong relations with universities and research institutes, and have always valued their independence and integrity,"" Google told CNBC. ""We're happy to support academic researchers across computer science and policy topics, including copyright, free expression and surveillance, and to help amplify voices that support the principles of an open internet. And unlike our competitors who fund the Campaign for Accountability, we expect and require our grantees to disclose their funding. ""
Leslie Miller, Google's director of public policy, addressed the issue in a blog post.
""Campaign for Accountability released a report about our funding of academic research,"" Miller said. ""It claims to list hundreds of papers we've ""in some way funded."" The report is highly misleading. For example, the report attributes to Google any work that was supported by any organization to which we belong or have ever donated (such as CCIA).""
""Our support for the principles underlying an open internet is shared by many academics and institutions who have a long history of undertaking research on these topics—across important areas like copyright, patents, and free expression,"" Miller added.

 Google, Amazon and 80,000 websites are protesting against the FCC's plans to reverse net neutrality   
 12:22  PM ET Wed, 12 July 2017 |  00:58 
 More than 80,000 websites including giants such as Facebook, Amazon and Google, are taking part in an online protest on Wednesday against the U.S. telecoms regulator's plan to roll back net neutrality rules.
 Under the Barack Obama administration in 2015, rules were put in place that meant internet service providers (ISPs) such as Comcast, Charter, and AT&T, had to treat all internet content equally. Essentially these ISPs are not allowed to block content or speed up or slow down data from certain websites.
This principle of net neutrality came under threat in May after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which is headed up by Ajit Pai who was appointed by President Donald Trump, voted to reverse rules put in place under Obama.
 The FCC argues that this will boost investment in new technology by removing regulation.
But internet companies have been vocal in their opposition to Pai's plans. That's why on Wednesday, many of these services are planning an online protest called the ""Day of Action"". Among the companies taking part are Twitter, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Reddit, Netflix, Airbnb, and Spotify.
""The FCC needs to listen to the voices of real people who will be affected by this attack on net neutrality protections – not just lobbyists from telecom companies in pursuit of more power,"" Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, one of the organizations behind the protests said in a statement on Tuesday.
""The goal of the protest … is to ensure that ordinary people have a voice and are heard by decision makers in Washington, D.C. No one – regardless of their political affiliation – wants their cable company to control what they can see and do on the Internet, or to charge extra fees to access the content they want.""
These sites are planning to show messages on their homepages speaking out against the FCC's plans. Signs like the one below will begin to appear on some websites urging people to send a letter to the FCC.
Twitter meanwhile has put out a blog post encouraging people to use the hashtag #NetNeutrality.
""The FCC should abandon its misguided effort to obviate all the work that has been done on behalf of all Internet users,"" Lauren Culbertson, public policy manager at Twitter, wrote in a blog post on Tuesday.
Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

An enhancement of a crop of a Google Street View panorama that was conceived by Google researchers.
 Researchers at Alphabet subsidiary Google have taught software to create great-looking photos out of panoramas that you can look at in Google Street View. 
 An academic paper published on Wednesday documents the Creatism system, which is just the latest fascinating thing Alphabet is doing with artificial intelligence -- alongside Facebook, Google and other tech companies. Other novel Alphabet efforts include the DeepDream image enhancement software and the NSynth synthesizer.
While Google has not put the Creatism technology into production, in time it could be used to improve what's available publicly. After all, today Google Street View panoramas are available in Google Maps, an app that has more than 1 billion monthly active users.
 Besides cropping a section of a panorama, the system also adjusts the saturation, high dynamic range (HDR) and light in order to get something that looks nice -- just as a human photographer might do after taking an original picture. ""Experiments show that a portion of our robot's creation can be confused with professional work,"" Googlers Hui Fang and Meng Zhang wrote in the paper.
See what you think -- here are some of the creations, above the panoramas they're derived from:
 More Creatism images and their original source images can be found here.

6,2017-07-17,"Google, which says it doesn’t underpay women, may not have to reveal as much as the U.S. government seeks  Mental coach of 3 top NBA draft picks shares 7 ways you can thrive under pressure  ","View Pictures | UIG | Getty Images
 A federal court in California moved on Friday to spare Google from turning over a trove of information about its employees to the U.S. government as the feds continue to investigate whether the tech giant underpays its female workers.
Since January, Google has resisted a demand by the Department of Labor that it share data — including the complete salary history and contact information for more than 21,000 employees — as part of a probe into potential ""systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce,""  the government previously has argued.
Google has repeatedly rejected those allegations, while arguing in court that the Labor Department's requests for data are  onerous and would jeopardize the privacy of Google's employees. Administrative Law Judge Steven Berlin on Friday agreed; in his ruling, he sought to impose limits on the government's request — a recommendation that will become final unless federal lawyers seek an appeal.
 Under the proposed order, Google must still provide the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, or OFCCP, with more data related to employees' demographic information. That includes name, gender and ethnicity, as well as their salary, as of September 2014. It's the second  so-called ""snapshot"" of Google's workforce sought by the agency, which obtained similar information about the tech giant's employees from September 2015.
But Google has been spared from the government's other demands — including a request that it  submit contact information for all 21,000 of its employees so that the Labor Department can more fully investigate claims of unequal pay.
Citing fears about hacking — and recent cyber attacks on the U.S. government — the court instead recommended the agency seek and obtain from Google the telephone numbers and email addresses from up to 5,000 of its workers, provided the company already has that data in its possession. Google has 30 days from the moment the order becomes final to share that information. Federal investigators may then seek a second round of contact information from 3,000 individuals for follow-up interviews.

Alphabet's Glass being used in manufacturing
 Google parent company Alphabet has officially launched the ""Enterprise Edition"" of its smart glasses hardware, which is now available to a network of Google partners.
 The company's developer partners range from logistics and manufacturing to patient care. These apps have long-been involved with the product formerly known as Google Glass through the business-focused ""Glass at Work"" program. 
In a blog post Tuesday, Glass project leader Jay Kothari said partners such as GE Aviation, AGCO, DHL, Dignity Health, NSF International, Sutter Health, Boeing and Volkswagen have been using Glass over the past several years, and make up just a sampling of 50 companies using the wearable.
 Wired said several of these companies found the original Google Glass to be very useful in factories and other enterprise environments. Google discovered this and began work on a product built by a team dedicated to building a new version of Glass for the enterprise.
According to Kothari, the Glass Enterprise Edition glasses are lighter and more ""comfortable for long term wear."" They also offer more power and longer battery life and, offer support for folks with prescription lenses, Wired said. The glasses, too, are stronger and do double duty as safety glasses.
Folks who disliked the first version of Glass because of privacy concerns will also be pleased to learn that this model, which has an upgraded 8-megapixel, has a red light that glows when the camera is recording.
Google initially unveiled the device with much fanfare in 2012, but it failed to catch on with consumers. Where it did succeed is with professionals, like field workers and doctors, who use the device to record information without needing to use their hands. As an example, an app called Augmedix uses Glass to help doctors transcribe notes from patient interactions. 
""Now the Glass product team is back at X, and we'll be collaborating with the Google Cloud team and our partners to help customers across a variety of business sectors make the most of Glass,"" Kothari said. ""Together, we're looking forward to seeing more businesses give their workers a way to work faster and in a more focused way, hands-free.""
Correction: The new product is called simply ""Glass,"" and is overseen by the X business unit, which is part of Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" and is not part of Google.

Diane Greene, Google
 Google is adding to its cloud service lineup with a new product that companies can use to manage the job application process.
 Google Hire is designed to help human resources coordinators at small and mid-sized businesses schedule interviews and keep track of their candidates, Alphabet said Tuesday.
The service integrates with existing Google cloud services like Gmail but is separate from the G Suite bundle, which includes programs for documents, spreadsheets, slideshows and video-conferencing as well as Gmail. Google Hire will cost extra, and pricing will vary based on company size. 
 While it's narrowly focused, Google Hire could still pose a threat to companies like Greenhouse, Lever, SmartRecruiters and Workable. At the same time, its simplicity could lead to more adoption of G Suite, which competes with Microsoft's Office 365.

 Through Google Hire, an HR manager can view the schedules of all the employees who will be part of the interview process, thanks to an integration with Google Calendar. Coordinators can keep track of all their candidates in Google Sheets and have initial conversations using Google Hangouts.
By syncing with Gmail, the service lets employees send messages to candidates with Google Hire or with e-mail. 
Some of the earliest work that went into Google Hire took place at Bebop, a start-up founded by Alphabet board member and VMware co-founder Diane Greene, Google vice president Dmitri Krakovsky told CNBC. Alphabet acquired Bebop in 2015, and at the same time named Greene as the head of Google's cloud. 
Companies using Google Hire can choose where on the web to display job listings. That includes sites like Glassdoor and Indeed and even in Google search results through the recently introduced Google for Jobs feature. 
Listings for high-level positions can be promoted on a more limited basis.
""If you're looking for a CEO, you don't want to put that out there for everybody to see,""  Krakovsky said.

 But you will have heard about some of her work.
Vestager has taken on some of the biggest companies in the world, Amazon, McDonald's, and Apple to name a few. But it's the European Union commissioner's most recent case that has caught the world's attention.
 The commission's seven-year long probe into Google's abuse of the search engine market finally came to an end last month. The investigation resulted in Google being slapped with the largest EU antitrust penalty on record, $2.7 billion.
The commission found that Google denied ""consumers a genuine choice"" when it illegally prioritised its own shopping service in its search results, while purposely relegating its rivals.

 In taking on tech titans like Google and Facebook, Vestager has had to make some pretty huge decisions and conclusions in her career.
Talking to CNBC in an episode of Life Hacks Live, Vestager shared her wisdom on how she builds such complex cases and comes to groundbreaking decisions.
""You have to deal with the facts of the case. What are we dealing with here? So it's not based on gut feeling or the weather or if it's a Tuesday instead of a Wednesday, you can't do that.""
""You need to have the advice from experienced people coming from different kinds of educational and backgrounds in general, and then you can make a decision,"" said Vestager.
""But you need people around you that you trust to give you advice, and you need to make sure that the facts of the case are presented.""

 7:03  AM ET Fri,  3 June 2016 |  01:15 
 Vestager's decision-making process can be used no matter the significance of the decision.
""I've asked myself what is the worst thing that can happen if I take this decision and go along with it.""
""Very often I find that the worst thing that can happen is something that I can live with. And if that's the case I will do it.""
""But if I find that the worst thing that can happen is something that I couldn't live with, then I have to reconsider and figure out then what to do,"" she added.
Unlike many of us, Vestager's decisions will have repercussions around the world. But in thinking about the many people her choices will impact, she finds clarity.
""Very often I think about the people that I represent. I meet people who have thousands and thousands of employees, and millions and millions of customers – and also make a lot of money. But I think about the millions of Europeans that I represent in order to try to balance that so we can meet on more equal terms.""
""I try to picture my people back home, the people I meet when I travel in Europe. All the people that need someone to make sure that things are done the right way.""

Doctor Huang Yunchao, wearing Google Glass, performs a live surgery to remove a tumor at The Third Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University.
 Google's digital glasses, rejected by consumers three years ago as an elite, privacy-invading toy, have picked up a lunchpail and gone to work.
 The research arm that produced Google Glass, known as X and led by Google co-founder Sergey Brin, has focused on a corporate version targeted at workers ranging from doctors to warehouse managers.
But to create meaningful revenue for its parent company, Google will have to find a way to get the product into a market in which its only experience is selling cloud computing and digital advertising.
 Google in the past has sold the unit for a price of $1,500, while a report from the market research firm Forrester Research predicts 14.4 million American workers will be using them by 2025.
Given those assumptions, the market for augmented-reality glasses like Google Glass could be worth between $1 billion to $2 billion in eight years -- if the product captures between 50 percent and 100 percent of it.
By way of comparison, Alphabet booked $90.3 billion in revenue last year, and Google's non-advertising businesses (including enterprise and Google Play) collectively booked just over $10 billion in 2016.
An email from CNBC to Google asking for the latest price on the device was referred to X, which declined comment.
To get there, Google will need to either find a distribution partner (or partners) with experience getting hardware into the enterprise or find a new way to market them at small- to mid-sized businesses.
Its current plan, according to a blog post by Jay Kothari, who leads the Google Glass project, is ""collaborating with the Google Cloud team and our partners to help customers across a variety of business sectors make the most of Glass.""
After years of trying, however, Google's cloud unit remains a distant third behind rivals Amazon and Microsoft.

Google must provide the Labor Department with contact data for up to 8,000 employees to investigate whether the Silicon Valley company shortchanges women doing similar work to men, according to Friday's provisional ruling by Steven Berlin, an administrative law judge in San Francisco.
Berlin also denied part of the government's request for records, agreeing with Google that the demand for contact information for more than 25,000 was too broad and could violate the privacy of employees. He also called it ""insufficiently focused.""
 In an interview, Labor Department regional solicitor Janet Herold said she's pleased the judge ordered Google to produce most of the kinds of records that the Labor Department has been fighting to access. Her office is trying to show there's a systemic wage gap at Google.
""We want to make it clear men and women of Google that we want to hear from them,"" she said. ""That's our focus now.""
Google has denied it pays women unequally.
In a blog post published Sunday, Eileen Naughton, Google's vice president of people operations, wrote that over the past year, Google had provided more than 329,000 documents and more than 1.7 million data points, including detailed compensation information, but ""reached an impasse"" when the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs wanted deeper personnel data.

 ""We were concerned that these requests went beyond the scope of what was relevant to this specific audit, and posed unnecessary risks to employees' privacy,"" Naughton wrote.
Berlin's decision, she noted, found that interviews with Google executives and managers — as well as reviews of more than 1 million compensation-related data points and other documents — resulted in ""nothing credible or reliable"" to show that the Labor Department's theory is based on ""anything more than speculation.""
Appearing in court in April, Janette Wipper, a Labor Department regional director, said investigators found ""systemic compensation disparities against women pretty much across the entire workforce.""
Google, based in Mountain View, Calif., disagreed with the charges, saying at the time: ""Every year, we do a comprehensive and robust analysis of pay across genders and we have found no gender pay gap.""

Google says U.S. suit is wrong — it pays women fairly
Only about one in five tech jobs at Google is held by a woman, the company says, while women represent nearly one-third of Google's more than 70,000 workers. In 2015, a former Google employee alleged a pattern of pay inequity, a charge the company denied.
The Labor Department's probe evolved from a lawsuit filed in January seeking to bar Google doing business with the federal government unless it complied with an audit of employee compensation records. Google has said it turned over some of the requested records but withheld others that it believes would invade workers' privacy.
In his decision, Judge Berlin said the Labor Department didn't explain convincingly why it needed extensive data — including names, addresses, telephone numbers and personal email addresses — of Google workers.

 The department had already requested that Google provide information about workers' dates of birth, education, performance ratings and salary histories, among other details.
Berlin wrote that allowing the Labor Department to obtain all the data it seeks could expose innocent Google employees to identity theft, fraud or other dangers.
""Anyone alive today likely is aware of data breaches surrounding this country's most recent Presidential election,"" he wrote. Berlin also noted that the Labor Department itself was ""recently attacked with ransomware.""
He said the department should move more slowly and deliberately with its investigation, rather than asking for bulk data while offering ""nothing credible or reliable"" to show that it is doing more than speculating. The 43-page decision could be finalized as soon as the end of July if an appeal is not filed.

Jeffrey Katzenberg
 After selling DreamWorks animation to NBCUniversal for $3.8 billion, executive Jeffrey Katzenberg's next move is to create a TV service for the mobile generation.
 The proposed New TV, which Katzenberg told CNBC will cost about $2 billion to launch, will feature original shows. Episodes will be no longer than 10 minutes in length, but retain the high production values and quality people expect from traditional television.
Variety first reported that shows will not have ad breaks, but instead use title sponsors and brand integrations in episodes. There is no launch date as of yet. 
 Top producers J.J. Abrams, Ron Howard, Mark Burnett and Jerry Bruckheimer have been interested in working on projects, Katzenberg said. He also has deals to license custom content from Disney, FOX, CBS and Lionsgate.
The cost may seem high, but sources told CNBC that Katzenberg has met with Apple, Google, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Snapchat and Spotify executives for funding. Based on potential partners, there may be a free ad-supported model as well as a paid subscription service, sources added.

 These pictures show how ethereum is taking over the digital currency world   
 9:15  AM ET Thu, 20 July 2017 |  00:54 
 Ethereum's presence has grown rapidly in wealthy regions of the world in the two years since the full launch of the digital currency.
 While rival cryptocurrency bitcoin has grabbed most of the attention, briefly tripling in value this year, ethereum's value has run up a few thousand percent. The digital currency was officially launched on July 30, 2015, and some believe the ethereum network's ability to support applications could pave the way for a new, decentralized internet.

Ethereum nodes in the United States (2017)
 On Tuesday, Peter Szilagyi, head of an ethereum development team, tweeted Google Earth images showing the global spread of ethereum nodes, or computers participating in the ethereum network by executing and recording all transactions in what is known as the blockchain.

 Ethereum briefly crashes 20% to 7-week low amid worries about rival bitcoin's future

 Szilagyi created the images by converting the computer Internet Protocol addresses from ethernodes.org into geographic locations and plotting them on Google Earth. He added that the ethernodes project may not include every single node, but the data is ""the best we currently have.""
So far, the images show ethereum nodes are more prevalent in the developed world.
""If you compare the wealthier regions like US and EU vs. the poorer regions like Asia and South America,"" Szilagyi said in an email to CNBC, ""you'll see that node density seems to go hand in hand with connectivity, industrialization and wealth. My best bet as to why the discrepancy is that running a full Ethereum node is resource intensive.""
Ethereum nodes in Europe

Central Europe is by far the most packed for the nodes. That's not surprising since the Ethereum Foundation and many other digital currency firms are based in Switzerland.
""Central Europe does seem a bit more saturated than the U.S. for example (without looking at actual numbers),"" Szilagyi said. ""That might be because Ethereum's development team is mostly based in Europe, so we've had a bit more exposure to Ethereum before it began to spread globally.""

In mid-June, digital currency enthusiasts speculated about a ""flippening,"" a term used to describe the time when ethereum's market capitalization would surpass bitcoin's.
The two currencies came close to that event on June 13, when ethereum had roughly 33 percent of digital currency market capitalization, while bitcoin had about 40 percent.
However, ethereum dropped after some initial coin offerings clogged its network. Ethereum also briefly plunged from above $300 to 10 cents on one exchange in a flash crash on June 21.
As of Wednesday afternoon, ethereum had about 25 percent of digital currency market cap, while bitcoin had 45 percent.
That said, Szilagyi said comparing ethereum nodes to bitcoin nodes is like ""apples vs. oranges.""
""The underlying assumptions about them are different, people's expectations of them are different,"" he said.

 });Ben Gomes, Vice President of Search Engineering at Google, at the Googleplex campus in Mountain View.
 Google is making its mobile app look more like a news feed as it battles Facebook and Amazon for the attention of -- and information about -- online consumers.
 This week the technology giant updated its app to add content from more sources. For example, data on local events, eateries and weather will be available alongside regular search results.
Users will also be able ""follow"" an area of interest with the touch of a button. Having users input this information could help Google further tailor search results and offer better information to advertisers. This could help Google compete in mobile advertising against Facebook, which collects detailed information about users based on their likes and preferences, then uses this information to target ads.
 Google, a unit of Alphabet, also tweaked how it presents this information, especially for users of its Pixel smartphone, who can access the feed by ""swiping left"" from their home screen. It looks more like news feeds from Facebook, Twitter, or Apple News, and features ""cards"" with specific sets of information like sports scores and news headlines. Some of these cards will contain information from other Google services, like YouTube.
The idea is to make the feed ""an extension of Google search,"" said Shashidhar Thakur, vice president of search, in a presentation to reporters earlier this week. The goal is ""to keep you in the know even when you're not searching,"" Thakur said.
The updates to a format Google first unveiled last December come a day after Amazon unveiled Spark, its own feed of product photos and stories designed to help subscribers to its Prime service find products to buy more easily.
And they come more than a year after Facebook first began experimenting with a new shopping tab in its own news feed.
 Mobile requires 'bite-sized answers,' says Google search VP
 All three technology giants are looking for new ways to engage with mobile consumers.
While Google now sells everything from videos to smartphones, it still got 87 percent of its first quarter revenue from selling ads. 
But with more people searching with mobile phones than PCs, Google is feeling pressure to update its core business.
The shift to mobile means Google has to give users ""bite-sized answers to questions,"" says Ben Gomes, vice president of the company's core search product.
""The vast majority of our queries come from mobile phones,"" Gomes said during a demonstration of the new features for the media in San Francisco on Tuesday.
The changes will come first to the English version of the Google app for Android and iOS. International versions and one for browsers will be added eventually, the company executives said.
When a reporter asked if the company has plans to place ads -- in the form of sponsored posts -- into the feed, Gomes declined to comment.
Here's a couple examples Google showed us of the new feed:
 Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Google changed its feed feature, which appears even when users don't actively search for information.

 Former Google exec is teaming up with the Mayo Clinic to help prevent a major cause of sudden death   
 11:48  AM ET Wed, 19 July 2017 |  02:31 
 The same type of machine learning technology that can automatically organize Google photos might someday be used to prevent sudden death. 
 That's the vision of Vic Gundotra, chief executive officer of medical technology start-up AliveCor and a former executive at Google. Gundotra announced on Wednesday that his company is teaming up with the Mayo Clinic to develop tools to screen for a heart rhythm condition called Long QT that causes thousands of deaths per year. 
AliveCor is also announcing its third round of investment from the Mayo Clinic in the past nine months, bringing its total funding from all of its investors to just more than $45 million. The company declined to comment on the details of its funding from Mayo. 
 AliveCor is best known for its Band-Aid-sized sensor called Kardia Mobile, which attaches to a smartphone. When users put their fingers on Kardia's pads, it takes readings called electrocardiograms that indicate problems with the electrical activity of the heart. Anyone can buy the device for $99.
The company is also developing a version of its Kardia device for the Apple Watch. 
Gundotra said he came out of retirement to join AliveCor because he believed that artificial intelligence could be used for disease prevention. ""Deep neural networks can uncover signals that human doctors often can't see,"" he said. 
AliveCor already has the green light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to analyze electrocardiograms to detect an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. So it is turning its attention to Long QT syndrome, an electrical condition in the heart that causes it to beat irregularly. The inherited version kills 3,000 to 4,000 people in the U.S. every year. (There's also a version that can be caused by commonly prescribed drugs.)
""The new partnership is another endeavor to look at the electrocardiogram signal and find another secret,"" Gundotra said. ""The secret we are after is genetic Long QT.""
Such technology could save lives, suggested Mayo Clinic's Michael Ackerman, given that the genetic form often goes undiagnosed until it's too late. ""But when we find it, our treatments are incredibly effective,"" he said. 
This technology is still in the investigational phase, stressed Ackerman, and Mayo and AliveCor will need to demonstrate that it's accurate and cost-effective. But his team at Mayo are hoping within a few years to develop a cheap and simple screening using AliveCor's Kardia Mobile. The idea is that anyone could use it, including coaches, primary care doctors and pharmacists. 
Ultimately, if such a feat is possible, Ackerman hopes that the electrical heart cycle will be the ""next vital sign,"" which is as common to measure as blood pressure. 
""The goal is to prevent the sudden death of young people because of QT-related heart issues,"" he said.

9,2017-07-20,What happened when Google made its CEO share an office with one of his engineers  ,"In 2001, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin brought in CEO Eric Schmidt to help them scale the booming business they had on their hands. Google was then doing more than $100 million in revenue and was three years from going public. 
 Though Schmidt was impressed by Page and Brin's intellectually rigorous interview process, he was not terribly impressed with his first day on the job.
Schmidt's title made him part of the C-suite — in name only. ""My first office at Google was an 8-by-12 office, just enough room for me and my desk and my little chair,"" says Schmidt, speaking with Linkedin co-founder Reid Hoffman on the podcast, ""Masters of Scale.""
 To further confuse things, the then-CEO walked in to find he had a roommate.
""I said 'Hello.' He says, 'Hello.' I said, 'Hi, I'm Eric.' And he goes, 'Hi, I'm Amit.'""

 Schmidt, who is today the Chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet and worth almost $12 billion according to Forbes, didn't expect to have to share.
""Now, as a new person coming into the company, it's very important to not create a cultural faux pas,"" says Schmidt.
""Like it would be incorrect to say, 'I'm the CEO. Get the heck out of my office.'""
 ""A dash of insubordination is the secret ingredient to Google's success.""
-Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn
 Schmidt's secretary didn't know anything about the seating arrangements, so Schmidt asked Amit who said it was OK for him to move in with the CEO.
According to Amit, it was the VP of engineering. Schmidt thought his new team must be playing a joke on him.
He asked Amit why he moved in. ""Well, because I was in a six person office, it was very crowded, and your office was empty,"" Schmidt recalls Amit saying.
Fair enough.
""So we became colleagues,"" he says.

 It turned out to be fortuitous.
When Schmidt got down to working, he called the vice president of sales to talk numbers.
""At the time the revenue was estimated about 120 [million dollars],"" says Schmidt. ""And I said, 'Don't you think you could do better?' And he said, 'Well, I think we can get to 123, 124.' 'Come on push harder, push harder,"" Schmidt says.
When he hung up, ""Amit takes his headphones off and says, 'I can tell you what the revenue is going to be,'"" Schmidt tells Hoffman.
""And so I said, 'What's the revenue going to be?' And he said, 'It's going to be 138.'
""I said, 'How do you know that?' 'Because I build the analytics that predict this,'"" Schmidt recalls Amit saying.
Schmidt continues, ""And so I didn't tell the sales people, and I watched, and they kept moving their forecast up and hit 138.
""It was a really easy lesson to understand the power of data analytics — plus having a great roommate.""
Schmidt and Amit shared an office for years as Google grew. And, according to Schmidt, the two became good friends.

 Today Google has a market cap of $675 billion.
There's also a bigger lesson. The unique culture described by Schmidt is part of what makes Google tick, according to Hoffman, the podcast host.
""I would argue that a dash of insubordination is the secret ingredient to Google's success. Ideas emerge organically through conversations like the one Eric and Amit had in their cramped executive suite,"" says Hoffman.
""There's only one way to keep those unruly conversations going. You let them unfold chaotically, anywhere and everywhere across the organization. And you listen for what bubbles up. If you want your company to innovate, your job is to manage the chaos.""

 Lyft plans to launch new self-driving car division   
 2:49  PM ET Fri, 21 July 2017 |  00:50 
 Lyft is opening its own autonomous driving facility in Palo Alto, California, and creating its own self-driving team, the company said Friday.
 Until now, the company has relied on partnerships to push into autonomous driving and catch up to chief rival Uber's efforts. It's signed deals with some of the biggest players in the space — from Alphabet's Waymo to start-up nuTonomy to carmaker GM, a major Lyft investor.
It's part of what Lyft calls its ""Open Platform Initiative."" Before this the company has mostly relied on its partners' teams of engineers and technology and been content to provide the ride-hailing network.
 This is the biggest move Lyft itself has made into the space, and the company will be developing its own technology.
""Lyft is also uniquely positioned to build technology in collaboration with partners in a way that will make it possible to roll out self-driving cars at scale in the fastest, safest, most efficient way,"" said Luc Vincent, Lyft's vice president of engineering.
The company expects there to be ""several hundred"" working on self-driving technology at its Palo Alto facility by the end of 2018. The facility is set to open in a few weeks. It's unclear how many will be new hires. 
Lyft is not, for now, developing its own LIDAR technology, but didn't say whether that would change in the future. If Lyft did, it could potentially put it in competition with partners like Waymo that are developing their own LIDARs. (Waymo is currently in a fierce courtroom battle with Uber over that exact technology.) But Lyft says its technology will coexist with others.
""We look at this as an opportunity to take what we're developing and give it to others,"" said Raj Kapoor, Lyft's chief strategy officer. ""For self-driving to work as an industry, there has to be more sharing.""
On Lyft's ""open-self driving"" platform, it hopes to offer customers access to vehicles from its partners, such as Waymo and nuTonomy, and will also be offering cars with its own Lyft self-driving technology.
Lyft said it doesn't see self-driving cars replacing its drivers — it hopes to create a ""hybrid"" network where passengers can choose either.
""When a passenger requests a ride that a self-driving car can complete, we may send one to complete the trip. If that person needs to go somewhere self-driving cars are unable to navigate, or their needs call for a different level of service, they will have a driver,"" Vincent said in a post published Friday.

 Online ad fraud is a growing problem, and even huge platform companies like Google and Verizon's Oath are not immune.
 Google-run tests found fraudulent companies selling ad space on premium websites they did not have access to, or on fake versions of real websites, as first reported by Business Insider. The fraudulent ad space was sold through programmatic ad exchanges — automated ad sales platforms — including Google's AdX, AppNexus, Oath's Brightroll, and PubMatic. (Oath is the new umbrella brand for more than 50 media and technology brands previously owned by AOL and Yahoo.)
""Some of our publisher partners have asked us for help with understanding how their brand is impacted by counterfeit inventory and the scope of the issue across the ads ecosystem,"" a Google spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. ""These tests have confirmed how widespread of an issue this is for publishers.""
 Ad fraud will cost companies around the globe $16.4 billion this year, according to ad verification company Adloox. There are a variety of ways it can occur, including fake ""bot"" traffic to websites meant to mimic human activity or ads so tiny that they can't be seen by the human eye.
How to combat ""spoofing"" 
The type of ad fraud Google's test was looking at is called ""spoofing.""
The method is used to trick ad buyers into purchasing advertising space on websites that don't exist, or that the sellers don't have access to. Because of the speed and volume of advertising online when bought programmatically, it's virtually impossible to check if an ad ran where sellers say it was supposed to run.

 Beware of schemes that could drain your bank account   
 12:55  PM ET Fri, 12 May 2017 |  00:59 
 Google, AppNexus, Oath and PubMatic say they are actively working to fight ad fraud. One of the main initiatives they're involved in is called ads.txt, which directly fights spoofing.
Ads.txt, which is led by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Tech Lab, is a text file where publishers list approved ad sellers. Companies can then use it to create programs to make sure they don't buy unauthorized ad space. 
Spoofing and unauthorized selling is ""pervasive,"" and ads.text can help, IAB Tech Lab general manager Alanna Gombert explained. But it must be an industry-wide effort to help defeat ad fraud, she said.
""Everyone has an equal part in cleaning the fraud,"" Gombert said. ""The publishers have to be aware where their inventory is showing up, or their 'fake inventory.' The buyers can't take deals. If it's too good to be true, it probably is.""
Programmatic platforms also say companies need to invest in their own internal technology. 
""Oath has invested in proprietary technology on our buying platforms, including BrightRoll and ONE by AOL, that aims to enforce supply transparency and prevent domain spoofing across the majority of supply partners,"" Oath said in a statement.
""In fact, our technology blocks hundreds of millions of spoofed bid requests on a daily basis. Combined with our longtime partnership with the IAB, industry-leading third-party fraud measurement across our platforms and human review safeguards, we're fully committed to a safe, transparent supply chain for our advertiser partners.""
AppNexus vice president of corporate communications Josh Zeitz told CNBC ad fraud is an ""industry-wide challenge.""
""We've invested heavily in detection technology that enables us to find and shut down such bad activity; ads.txt, which we are avidly promoting, is also an important technology development that will help all exchanges, including Google's AdX and AppNexus, clamp down on this type of activity,"" Zeitz said.
Pubmatic chief marketing officer Jeffrey K. Hirsch said the company was trying to understand where Google's data on the ""spoofing"" cases came from, and declined to comment on the report. However, Pubmatic is actively working on ad fraud issues, including through the ads.txt program.
""Having the IAB support this is important for the industry and we support the effort,"" Hirsch said. ""We have many internal and third party technology solutions for monitoring fraud and a solution such as ads.txt will surely provide additional value as the transparent connection between buyers and sellers is, based on increased brand spend in digital, perhaps more important than ever.""

 Crypto investors flock to a market where tech giants Amazon, Google and Facebook are absent   
 2:38  PM ET Mon, 24 July 2017 |  00:47 
 Money is pouring into cryptocurrencies at a furious clip. You can call it a bubble, or the Wild West. Some say it's reminiscent of dot-com stocks in 1999, or ""tulip mania"" from nearly 400 years ago. 
 There's plenty of speculation, to be sure, and more risks than we can count.
But for entrepreneurs and tech investors, crypto and the underlying blockchain technology has a particularly attractive quality that's unique in today's tech landscape — it's about the only high-growth area not occupied by the industry giants.
 Think about all the buzzwords like cloud, robotics, internet of things, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. In each case, the names that come to mind are Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft.
Those five companies are worth a combined $3 trillion and have $530 billion in cash. They're big, getting bigger and building the computing platforms of the future.
For Chris Dixon, a partner at venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, their relative absence from crypto and blockchain is a welcome sight.
""A big challenge in the start-up world is that we live in an era of very powerful incumbents,"" Dixon said, in a recent interview with CNBC.

 Ethereum's drop is making some say the Crypto-bubble is bursting   
 7:11  PM ET Tue, 11 July 2017 |  00:52 
 Dixon has led his firm's investments in Coinbase, a site for buying, selling and storing cryptocurrencies, and Keybase, a cryptographically protected chat service. Andreessen Horowitz also has backed Polychain Capital, a hedge fund that invests in digital currencies. 
In the second quarter, equity investments in blockchain start-ups jumped 44 percent to $232 million, according to CB Insights. The bigger boom is in initial coin offerings (ICOs), which are unregulated sales of digital coins or tokens that crypto projects are using as a new form of currency. More than $1.2 billion was raised through ICOs in the first half of 2017, according to Autonomous Research.
Not to confuse quantity with quality. Most of this stuff will surely go to zero, and eventually, the SEC will have plenty to say about it.
 `On the sidelines'
 But for now, there's a lot of wiggle room, as the tech leaders invest around the edges of blockchain while focusing their time and money elsewhere.
""I can't imagine they view any of what's happening right now as a competitive threat to their business,"" said Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), which invests in an array of blockchain companies, projects and currencies. ""They're not going to be a first mover. They're going to watch innovation happen, they're going to learn, sit on the sidelines and to the extent they see something that plugs in nicely to their business model, they'll acquire.""
It's important to differentiate between blockchain and crypto.
The blockchain is a distributed electronic ledger that allows all transactions such as payments, loans and contracts to be tracked in real time. Cryptocurrencies are an application of blockchain technology that take advantage of its decentralized nature to create alternative forms of money that aren't tied to central banks. Hundreds of crypto projects have created their own currencies.
While the tech giants are practically nonexistent in crypto, they're at least paying attention to blockchain and putting a little money to work.
Microsoft has a product in its Azure cloud called blockchain as a service, which essentially hosts blockchain start-ups and workloads. Amazon Web Services was working on a similar offering with DCG as of a year ago, according to a Forbes story, though no official announcement has been made. 
Most of Alphabet's activity in the market is through its venture arm GV, which has backed start-ups including Blockchain (the company) and Ripple, a distributed payments network used by banks. Google's AI unit DeepMind is using a blockchain-like ledger to track and protect medical data. 
Apple and Facebook, meanwhile, have been near silent on the subject.

 IBM CEO talks 'new collar' jobs in tech   
 9:11  PM ET Mon,  9 Jan 2017 |  04:35 
 The most vocal of the big vendors has been IBM, which said last month that it's building blockchain technology for seven of Europe's largest banks to facilitate international trade for small and medium-size enterprises. CEO Ginni Rometty said at a conference in January that IBM is using blockchain internally to track financing and is also working with large retailers and shippers, implementing blockchain throughout global logistics systems.
It's all early and there remain opportunities for upstarts to create new blockchain platforms.
Crypto projects are even less proven, as there haven't been any breakout use cases other than bitcoin as a store of value, albeit a quite volatile one.
Investors see a promising market where Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg aren't yet lurking. Josh Hannah, a partner at venture firm Matrix Partners, has been buying cryptocurrencies for his own accounts but isn't yet betting his firm's money on any projects or start-ups. 
He's waiting and watching.
""Most of this is much closer to the research end than we usually play,"" said Hannah, who previously helped create betting site Betfair. ""If crypto delivers on its promise, then it could be one of those platform disruptions, which would be great for entrepreneurs and VCs.""
That is, Hannah notes, ""unless this one disrupts VCs.""

Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google Inc.
 Alphabet, the parent company of Google, said Monday that Google CEO Sundar Pichai has joined its board of directors.
After more than a decade at Google, Pichai was named CEO of the company when it was re-organized in August 2015 into a unit of Alphabet.
 Pichai ""helped lead the development of key consumer products which are now used by over a billion people,"" the company said in a statement announcing the appointment.
The addition of Pichai adds another company officer to the board, which already includes Google co-founders Larry Page, now Alphabet CEO, and Sergey Brin, president, and chair and former CEO Eric Schmidt.
Diane Greene, head of Google's enterprise and cloud unit, is also on the Alphabet board.
That's a total of 5 insiders on a 13-person board, which is a fairly high proportion of insiders compared with other major tech companies.
By way of comparison, Apple and Amazon each have only 1 insider on their boards (CEOs Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos respectively) and Microsoft has 3 insiders on its 12-person board (including LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, who joined after Microsoft bought LinkedIn). Facebook's board is more heavily stacked toward insiders, with 3 out of 8 (including WhatsApp founder Jan Koum).
Generally speaking, boards of directors are meant to represent the interests of shareholders in cases of conflict with company leadership, although the multiclass share voting structures used by some tech companies, including Alphabet and Facebook, concentrate voting power in the hands of founders, giving significantly more power to those founders.
Alphabet shares are down after hours after the company reported Q2 earnings that beat expectations.

Preisdent Donald Trump speaks during a meeting at the White House
 House Republicans are asking the chief executives of tech and telecom rivals — including Facebook, Google, AT&T and Comcast* — to appear before the U.S. Congress in September and help settle the debate over net neutrality once and for all.
At the moment, the Trump administration is preparing to scrap the U.S. government's existing rules, which prevent internet service providers from blocking or slowing down web traffic, or from charging companies like YouTube or Netflix for faster delivery of their content. The reason: The Federal Communications Commission under its GOP leader, Chairman Ajit Pai, believes they're too heavy handed.
But Pai's plans for repeal — a guaranteed outcome at the Republican-controlled FCC — mark only the latest round of fighting in a debate that's more than 15 years in the making. The constant legal wrangling has left all sides in agreement that  Congress should get involved and craft a law that says what internet providers can or can't do.
 To that end, Rep. Greg Walden, the Republican leader of the tech-focused House Energy and Commerce Committee, has asked the chief executives of top technology and telecommunications companies to testify before his panel at a newly announced, September 7 hearing focused on net neutrality, he said today.
Invitees include Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, A&T CEO Brian Roberts, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, and the leaders of Amazon, Netflix, Charter and Verizon, according to the committee.
In a letter requesting their appearance, Walden said the open internet rules put in place during the Obama administration — which subject broadband providers to utility-like regulation — ""disrupted the longstanding regulatory balance that for years allowed the internet to grow and thrive.""
As Pai looks to repeal them, however, it gives both sides ""an opportunity to rethink the current regulatory model and build new rules from the ground up"" in Congress, Walden continued.
More from Recode: Rob Fishman used to connect young stars with advertisers. Now he's making videos with them at his new startup, Brat. Google is having trouble pushing its Facebook-like news feed to Android devices Twitter says it's punishing 10 times more users for being abusive than it was a year ago
""With your help, I know we can craft a fair, predictable and sustainable solution that not only benefits edge providers and internet service providers, but also the billions of consumers worldwide that deserve a free and open internet,"" he told chief executives in his letter requesting their help.
At the FCC, Pai's repeal effort marks the third time in recent years that the agency is at the drawing board over net neutrality, after the likes of Comcast and Verizon took the agency to court and blocked its earlier efforts to implement open internet rules.
That vicious cycle has left both sides of the debate pining for Congress, not the FCC, to broker a resolution on net neutrality, so that the government's approach to internet policy doesn't change depending on which party is in power — or who prevails in federal courtrooms.
Even net neutrality advocates in the tech sector -- and repeal-friendly telecom giants — share a reluctance to continue fighting over the issue in wonky FCC proceedings and lawsuits. Companies like AT&T and Verizon told the FCC in official comments earlier this month that Congress should set down the final limits on how they can manage their web traffic. So did Facebook's Zuckerberg, who signaled his  support for congressional action in a note posted during the July 12 online protest of Pai's plans.
Now, those very executives are being asked to come before the House and actually begin the process of legislating, no easy task for the tech and telecom industries, which have long called for Congress to take action — and long have failed to reach any compromise.
Others in Congress share a desire to pursue legislation: That includes Walden's counterpart in the Senate, John Thune,  who wrote in Recode earlier this month that a new net neutrality law is ""obvious and — no, I'm not kidding — within Congress's reach.""
But lawmakers so far have offered few specifics, and for the moment, they don't have much Democratic support. Many in the party have rallied to save the FCC's existing, utility-like rules, preferring the Obama administration's approach.
Others, like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, fear that any attempt to tackle net neutrality with Republicans in charge of the White House and Congress will result in rules that are too weak — and given internet providers too much power to tamper with internet traffic.
""As a guy right now that has listened to Donald Trump, who is the president, who has the power of the pen, I don't want to go to work on legislation that he is not going to approve because he has a very different philosophy than I do,""  Booker told Recode. ""I think we should have net neutrality. [Trump] is saying, let corporations be able to do the kind of things . . . all the kind of things [that] we, who believe in net neutrality, are fighting against.""
Walden, however, expressed a note of optimism. Announcing his plans during a hearing with Pai and the FCC's other commissioners, the leading GOP lawmaker highlighted ""consensus is forming across party lines and across industries that it's time for Congress to call a halt on the back-and-forth and set clear net neutrality ground rules for the internet.""
""With almost everyone in agreement about fundamental principles to prevent anti-competitive behavior such as throttling and blocking, I think we are closer than ever to achieving a lasting resolution,"" he said. ""The time has come to get everyone to the table and get this figured out.""

Google CEO Sundar Pichai
 Google's cloud business closed three times more deals valued over $500,000 in the second quarter of 2017, than in the same period last year, the search giant's Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said on Monday.
 Pichai made the comments on parent company Alphabet's second quarter earnings call, in which he gave the only indication of the performance of Google's cloud division since the company does not break out individual results.
""Google Cloud Platform, GCP, continues to experience impressive growth across products, sectors and geographies. And increasingly with large enterprise customers and regulated sectors,"" Pichai said.
 ""In Q2, the number of big deals we closed worth more than half a million dollars is three times what it was last year. Responding to the growth in existing and new customers around the world, we continue to invest in data centers to provide them the fastest most reliable service.""
Google reported earnings that beat analyst expectations in the June quarter but were weighed down by a record $2.7 billion fine handed to it by European Union (EU) regulators last month.

 2:00  AM ET Tue, 25 July 2017 |  05:06 
 Its cloud business is accounted for in the ""other revenue"" section of its earnings statement which also includes hardware like its Pixel smartphone range. Google's other revenues rose 42.2 percent year-on-year to just over $3 billion in the second quarter. 
Alphabet also made 1,614 new hires in the June quarter, with the majority coming in the cloud division.
""The most sizeable headcount additions were once again made in cloud, for both technical and sales roles, consistent with the priority we place on this business,"" Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, said on the earnings call. 
The company's cloud business is made of two key parts. The first is the Google Cloud Platform, which includes storage, networking, artificial intelligence applications, and tools for developers. The second is G Suite, which is its set of products that include the Gmail email service and Docs. 
 'Momentum ahead'
 While Google trails Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud, it has big ambitions. Earlier this year,  the head of Google's cloud business Diane Greene said the company could surpass Amazon as the market leader by 2022.

""G Suite working together with GCP, we are seeing increasing win rates and adoption across enterprise customers,"" Pichai said.
""We are set up incredibly well and look forward to the momentum ahead.""

 Aegis Capital's Victor Anthony: Long-term secular story for Google hasn't changed at all   
 10:29  AM ET Tue, 25 July 2017 |  03:28 
 If Google's YouTube were a stock, it would be ""worth at least $75 billion,"" leading tech analyst Victor Anthony told CNBC on Tuesday.
 To put that in perspective, social media company Twitter has a market value of $14.52 billion. That would make YouTube worth just over five Twitters.
Google-parent Alphabet has a market capitalization of $661.8 billion.
 ""People are using YouTube six minutes a day, monthly active users are growing rapidly from the data that I'm tracking. This site is becoming entrenched in similar ways that Facebook is part of our vernacular and daily usage,"" Anthony, an analyst at Aegis Capital, said on ""Squawk on the Street.""
Anthony spoke after Alphabet's earnings report late Monday showed the company's revenue growth in the latest quarter was powered mainly by YouTube ads and mobile search ads. The stock was down about 3 percent Tuesday morning, trading around $968 per share, on revenue growth concerns.
Alphabet has been adding new content as it races Facebook and traditional TV networks for a share of the surging market for digital video ads. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said Monday that YouTube is seeing strong growth in emerging markets with mobile users and on ""large screens.""

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager holds a news conference at the EU Commission's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, June 27, 2017.
 Alphabet warned in its quarterly securities filing that it could face future fines from the European Union for two investigations that are still underway. Based on previous cases, investors might expect these fines to land in 2018.
 The statement in a note to the company's 10-Q gives the most detailed account yet of what the latest inquiry by EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager could cost the company.
Twice last year the EC sent Statements of Objection to Google.
 The first, on April 20, 2016, concerned ""certain Android distribution practices.""
The second, on July 14, 2016, came another SO ""regarding the syndication of AdSense for Search.""
The filing notes, ""There is significant uncertainty as to the outcomes of these investigations; however, adverse decisions could result in fines and directives to alter or terminate certain conduct. Given the nature of these cases, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or ranges of loss, if any.""
The disclosure came in a note to the same second-quarter earnings report in which Alphabet booked a $2.74 billion fine for using its dominance in search to unfairly point people to its own comparison shopping service.
And the matter may cost Alphabet more than money. It may also have to change how it does business.
""We are also evaluating the impact of potential remedies we may implement to address the EC's findings,"" the 10-Q document read.
Two years and two months passed between the time the European Commission sent its first letter to Alphabet -- with its objection to the shopping service -- and the levying of the fine. Accounting for that fine caused Alphabet's second-quarter profit to plunge.
If Vestager keeps the same timetable in her latest investigations of Google as she did with her first, Alphabet investors may want to ready themselves for another Q2 earnings bomb in 2018.

An Amazon.com employee lifts a box from a conveyor at the company's fulfillment center in Tracy, California.
 Even after Amazon's big rally this year, a Wall Street analyst still believes the stock can go higher based on some interesting analysis of Google search data. Piper Jaffray's Michael Olson reaffirmed his overweight rating for Amazon, citing the company's web search analysis which pointed to robust June quarter sales growth for the e-commerce giant. Our forecast ""model suggests strong Q2'17 Amazon unit [sales] growth,"" Olson wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. Amazon shares have rallied 38.6 percent this year through Monday, compared with the S&P 500's 10.3 percent return in that period.
 The analyst reiterated his price target of $1,200 for Amazon, representing 15.5 percent upside from Monday's close. Olson said the firm's web analysis revealed search interest for Amazon-related words grew 24 percent year over year in the June quarter versus 23 percent growth in the March quarter. He cited how Piper's search analysis had a 95 percent correlation with Amazon's retail sales unit growth in the previous 37 quarters. Regarding Amazon's announced acquisition of Whole Foods Market last month, the analyst predicts the internet company will now increase its food category investment spending. ""We believe that WFM will accelerate Amazon's pursuit of grocery delivery and other fulfillment methods, which will necessitate a significant distribution buildout,"" he wrote. ""While we think this is the right decision for shareholder value, it creates near-term margin headwinds."" Amazon is slated to report second quarter earnings on Thursday after the close.

Sergey Brin, president of Alphabet and co-founder of Google
 In the latest hearing in the Uber vs. Waymo lawsuit on Wednesday, San Francisco district judge William Alsup addressed Uber's complaint that Google co-founder Sergey Brin is trying to avoid deposition.
 Alsup said, ""you go back and tell that guy he better show up,"" after voicing frustration at Alphabet executives claiming they are ""too busy."" Brin is currently the president of Alphabet, the holding company that includes both Google and Waymo, the self-driving car unit that was spun out of Google.
Alsup also said Anthony Levandowski, the engineer at the center of the dispute, could be called to testify in court even though he has previously pleaded the fifth. Alsup also said that all questions by Uber and Waymo would be reviewed in advance and must have evidence backing them.
 Levandowski worked for Google's self-driving car unit before leaving to found his own company, Otto, which was later acquired by Uber. Waymo alleges that Levandowski stole over 14,000 documents from Alphabet when he left the company and took these trade secrets to Uber.
Alsup said Waymo has a strong case that Levandowski stole documents, but not that Uber used these to create its driverless-car technology. He told Waymo to come up with concrete evidence that Uber used its trade secrets in creating their technology by August 24.

 ""If you can't prove that Uber got these trade secrets, maybe you're in a world of trouble,"" Alsup said.
In a recent filing, Waymo also alleges that Uber's own lawyers at Morrison & Foerster (Mofo) helped cover up this theft. Judge Alsup didn't offer a ruling on this at Wednesday's hearing, but said it's ""disingenuous to say no one from Mofo will testify.""
""Whether or not Mofo testifies or not, their name will come up time and time again,"" Alsup said. ""Mofo is a character in the story to be told to the jury."" At Wednesday's hearing, Alsup indicated that he most likely would not disqualify Mofo from continuing to represent Uber.
Waymo and Uber lawyers also went back and forth over to specific evidence that could be brought into court.
Waymo lawyers said they tried for six weeks to get text messages between former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and Levandowski but Uber hasn't been cooperative in turning over Kalanick's cell phone. Waymo also wants to bring in the letter Uber's board wrote to Kalanick about his resignation as evidence, claiming it shows a connection between the trial and his resignation.
Uber said this a two-page letter, where ""half a sentence"" references the existence of the lawsuit, so therefore it is not relevant.
 Kalanick has also hired former San Francisco U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag and one of her colleagues at law firm Orrick to represent him in the upcoming trial, Bloomberg reported today. Waymo will question Kalanick on Thursday July 27 as they gather evidence before the trial starts in October.

 Data analysis site  Paysa looked at over 8,200 job posting and over 70,000 resumes at tech ""titans"" (companies worth at least $100 billion with an IPO more than 10 years ago) and ""tech disruptors"" (companies worth at least $10 billion with an IPO within the last 10 years) to determine how long you need to stay in school in order to snag one of their coveted jobs.
Of these major tech companies, Paysa found that Snap Inc. employees are the most likely to have a master's degree — over 36 percent of jobs at the social media company require one. (For perspective, just 9.3 percent of Americans over the age of 25 have a masters degree.)
 Even though Snap Inc. is the most likely to require a master's degree, they employ people with significantly less work experience than other tech companies. Paysa's research found that Airbnb, Twitter and Uber employees were most likely to have six to 10 years of experience, but Snap Inc. employees were most likely to have less than two years of experience.

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook
 Wall Street sees Facebook posting a higher quarterly profit when it releases financial results after the close of markets Wednesday, driven by surging sales of video and display ads.
 The company is expected to report second-quarter profit of $1.13 per share, based on the average estimate of 35 analysts who rate its stock.
That's up from 97 cents per share a year earlier, according to the estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters.
 Revenue is seen rising to $9.2 billion, a jump of 43 percent year-over-year.
If Facebook hits those numbers, its revenue growth for the period will be twice that of Alphabet unit Google, its larger rival and primary competitor in the market for online advertising.
Both are trying to rapidly add more video content to take advantage of an explosion in spending on video ads.
The market for digital video (not including traditional TV ads) is forecast to rise 19 percent this year to $11.7 billion, according to data from the research firm eMarketer, cited in a May report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau.
That's the same ad revenue growth rate Google had in the second quarter, based on the results Alphabet released Monday.
 Playing catch-up to YouTube
 While Alphabet has a head start thanks to its YouTube video service, which now has 1.5 billion monthly users and dozens of its own original shows, Facebook is racing to catch up.
The company now has 2 billion monthly users and is adding workers with job titles more familiar to Hollywood than Silicon Valley.
Facebook is also in talks with entertainment and media companies to produce its own original video content.
The company's video push has not been without challenges -- some of which could prove expensive.
Facebook said during the quarter it would add 3,000 workers to help keep violent and offensive material off its site.
That announcement came after leaders in Europe threatened to punish internet companies that allowed terrorists to use their services to plan attacks.
And Wall Street analysts have been lowering their full-year, 2017 earnings estimates for the company, expecting higher costs for producing video content and building more data centers.
Facebook has already alerted analysts that some expenses will grow faster than revenue:
""We continue to expect that full-year 2017 capital expenditures will be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, which is up over 50 percent compared to last year,"" CFO David Wehner said on the company's first-quarter earnings call in May.
 Instagram a new growth driver
 Facebook is also beginning to place ads on its other web properties, including Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram.
Facebook has been using Instagram to pummel smaller rival Snap, and the photo-sharing service CEO Mark Zuckerberg acquired for $1 billion in 2013 is expected to produce sales of $3.6 billion this year.
Facebook shares are up 41 percent this year, twice the gain of the broader market for tech shares, as measured by the Nasdaq Composite Index.

Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.
 A health start-up called Grail is developing one of the most ambitious technologies in Silicon Valley.
 And Amazon wants a piece of it. 
According to two sources familiar, Amazon invested in Grail as a very special kind of future customer for its cloud business.
 Grail is hoping that its can use deep sequencing technology to detect the earliest signs of cancer in the blood, while it's still treatable. That requires a huge amount of data processing and storage. 
That's potentially a huge business for Amazon Web Services. 
Reuters reported that the market to store human genetic data is expected to be worth $1 billion by 2018. By 2025, an anticipated 100 million and 2 billion human genomics could be sequenced, according to a 2015 report. Biologists have long-anticipated that the computing resources to handle all that data would outweigh Twitter and YouTube.
Grail's test will not be commercialized in the U.S. for years -- it is aiming for 2019 -- but it will be dabbling in huge data-sets well before then.
It needs to run large-scale clinical studies to demonstrate to industry stakeholders that its technology is both sensitive and accurate. Hundreds of thousands of people will need to be sequenced for each of these studies. And the genomes will need to be securely stored somewhere.
Amazon's investment, initially reported earlier this year, was a little surprising. The e-commerce and cloud services leader doesn't typically bet on start-ups in the regulated life sciences sector. Moreover, Grail CEO Jeff Huber, was a long-time executive at Google, an Amazon rival. (Google also invested in an earlier fund-raising round for Grail through GV, its venture arm, now a division of Google holding company Alphabet.) 
But these companies are ""positioning themselves for something they think will be big,"" said Zamin Iqbal, who leads a computational genomics research group at the European Bioinformatics Institute.
Iqbal doesn't expect revenues to be significant yet, in part due to privacy concerns and lack of uptick for whole genome analysis from health providers.
But that could all change in the coming years. ""The future of genomics is likely to involve the cloud heavily,"" he continued. 
Another factor that drew Amazon into the deal was Grail's presence in Asia, the people said. In March, the company merged with a blood diagnostics company in China. Amazon Web Services has announced it plans to open a new data center ""region"" in Hong Kong in 2018.

Satya Nadella speaking at the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 Microsoft on Wednesday is challenging Google's cloud computing business with a trendy new kind of cloud computing service that Google specializes in -- along with a super-cheap payment model that will be perfect for cutting-edge experimental uses.
 The Azure Container Instances tool will provide access to a container -- a virtual slice on a physical Microsoft server -- within seconds, Microsoft said, and the company will charge based on the number of seconds that a given container is being used, instead of by the minute or by the hour.
Containers, which have become trendy in the past few years, are considered a more efficient alternative to virtual machines.
 Microsoft has embraced the container format in its Windows Server software for corporate data centers, as well as in its Azure cloud, with services like the Azure Container Service and Azure Container Registry.
Now Microsoft is going deeper, with a focus on speed and simplicity.
""As the service directly exposes containers, there is no VM management you need to think about or higher-level cluster orchestration concepts to learn. It is simply your code, in a container, running in the cloud,"" Corey Sanders, head of product for Azure Compute at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post. 
The introduction of the product can be read as a challenge to Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, whose Google Container Engine is based on the Kubernetes open-source container cluster management software. Kubernetes is based on technology that Google used internally, and the company introduced it publicly in 2014 as competing container services became popular.
The service also represents Microsoft's latest shot at public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services.
Microsoft Azure revenue was up 97 percent year over year in the second quarter, Microsoft said last week.

 As rival tech giant Apple readies its huge new headquarters in Silicon Valley, Alphabet's Google is buying up real estate parcels like a land speculator.
 Google, based in Mountain View, California, has purchased 52 properties in Sunnyvale, California, about four miles to the south, for $820 million from a real estate development partner, CBRE, according to a report in Silicon Valley Business Journal.
A real estate brokerage has been quietly assembling the properties on behalf of the search giant, the report says.
 The purchases fill in gaps between multiple smaller campuses in Sunnyvale — the long-time home of Yahoo — that Google has purchased or leased in recent years, the report says.
The move comes one month after the company won exclusive rights to negotiate with the city of San Jose for the purchase of 16 tracts of land near that city's convention center and pro hockey arena.
Google and its development partner in that deal — real estate giant Trammell Crow — have already spent more than $100 million buying up parcels in San Jose.
When these purchases are complete, Google's Bay Area employees will be spread out from San Francisco to San Jose, while employees at its main Silicon Valley rivals Apple and Facebook will largely be clustered more closely together. That matters partially because of the region's traffic congestion, which earlier this year was named the third worst in the U.S. after New York and Los Angeles.
Google, which reported on Monday that it now has more than 72,000 employees, needs room to expand as it looks to hire even more workers to sustain its growth. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 YouTube's head of music confirmed that the company is planning on merging its Google Play Music service with YouTube Red to create a new streaming offering. During a panel session for the New Music Seminar conference in New York, Lyor Cohen stated that the company needed to merge the two services to help educate consumers and bring in new subscribers.
""The important thing is combining YouTube Red and Google Play Music, and having one offering,"" Cohen said when asked about why YouTube Red isn't more popular with music users. He didn't address whether or not the two apps would merge — but it seems very unlikely.
 CNBC
Lyor Cohen, CEO of Warner Music Group
 Right now, YouTube's music ecosystem is unnecessarily complicated. There's  YouTube Red, which removes ads from videos and lets you save them offline, while also giving you access to Google Play Music for free. Then there's  YouTube Music, which anyone can use, but it gets better if you're signed up for YouTube Red. And  YouTube TV is also a thing — an entirely separate thing — but it's not available everywhere yet.
 The merger has been rumored within the industry for months, and recently picked up steam after  Google combined the teams working on the two streaming services earlier this year.
More from The Verge:

In a statement to The Verge, Google said it will notify users of any changes before they happen. ""Music is very important to Google and we're evaluating how to bring together our music offerings to deliver the best possible product for our users, music partners and artists. Nothing will change for users today and we'll provide plenty of notice before any changes are made.""
Cohen also noted that he wanted to collaborate more directly with the music labels and rights holders. ""In my mind, the missing piece on building these businesses is collaborating with the [music] industry, and not just making deals and going away and seeing how it works."" The time frame for the rebranded service is still unclear, but given the recent merging of the teams — and the fact that Cohen is openly talking about it — it may not be much longer before we see what Google has in store.
In some ways, merging the services won't be a major change. Paying for a subscription to either YouTube Red or Google Play Music gives you the other service for free. But in terms of presenting a clear, simple, and compelling offering to consumers, combining the two makes a lot of sense — so much that you wonder why this hasn't happened already.

A disproportionate number of employees at these sought-after companies actually have advanced degrees, and one company stood out as employing the highest percentage of workers with Ph.D.s — Google.
 A whopping 16 percent of positions at Google require a doctorate degree. Less than 2 percent of Americans have earned a doctoral degree and an even smaller percentage have studied topics that are relevant to Google's work. Data visualization initiative Data USA reports that in 2015 there were only 34,002 people in the workforce with doctorate degrees in computer science — just 0.01 percent of the total U.S. population.

 });Tech companies like Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft top the list of employers that millennials want to work for. Why? Because they give young professionals what they want most: career growth, flexibility and a sense of purpose.
 In fact, tech companies represent four out of the top five employers millennials want to work for most.
That's according to a  recent study by the survey development platform SurveyMonkey. ""Millennials are primarily interested in opportunities for career growth,"" Jon Cohen, chief research officer at SurveyMonkey, tells CNBC Make It. ""Look at Microsoft, Apple, Google. They all have that same characteristic: growth.""
 The survey was conducted online among a national sample of 13,882 adults evaluating the top 75 companies ranked in the Fortune 500.
 Tech's quick expansion makes room for more jobs
 Cohen says that tech companies grow at a rapid pace, allowing for increased career opportunities and growth throughout the company. Older age groups are more interested in compensation and total package, says Cohen.
 var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];
 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 But for millennials there's a correlation between the top companies they want to work for and how fast those companies are growing, he says. Cohen adds that unlike other age groups, millennials see themselves advancing more swiftly into higher level positions.
In another survey, performed in partnership with job site Ladders, 80 percent of millennials say they expect a promotion within one to two years.
Millennials want ""accelerated promotions,"" which tech companies can provide"" because they have the financial ability and consistently add new roles as they grow, says Cohen.
 Millennials value flexibility over freebies
 Although companies like Google are known for giving perks like  free lunches, few millennials listed these bonuses as reasons they'd want to work for a tech company.
Stephan Dietrich, vice president of computer software platform Adobe Campaign, tells CNBC Make it that ""throwing free things"" at employees is not effective in retaining or attracting top talent.
 Edgar Su | Reuters
Google employee at a recreational area
 ""It's artificial to give free lunches and gym memberships,"" says Dietrich. People want to work at a company where they are ""able to learn and be challenged and see results,"" he says. ""Then the career growth comes naturally.""
However, 64 percent of millennials do say that they are most excited about company perks like flexible hours and working from home. Tech companies tend to dominate the lists of organizations that offer such flexibility, Cohen tells CNBC Make It.
 Young professionals want to make an impact
 Finally, millennials care about being challenged, impacting society and making a difference in the world, says Cohen. Working in tech allows them to be on the cutting-edge of society and see their ideas come to fruition.
Along the same lines, millennials are more likely to seek out companies with progressive management. A majority of millennials,  65 percent, say they'd rather work for an organization whose mission they believe in than a company that pays a lot.
Cohen points to Silicon Valley's swift response to President Trump's transgender military ban as well as the travel ban as examples of progressive thought in the tech space.
Dietrich doubles down on the importance of young professionals feeling that they are adding value to a company. He says that his team at Adobe has had a 40 percent growth rate because the ""younger generation is excited about learning and enjoy feeling like they have an impact.""
""If you keep them excited to come into work,"" he says, ""it will bring tremendous growth and revenue.""

Sundar Pichai, CEO, Google
 Google said it finally has an algorithm in place to bury junky Android apps that have bad reviews.
Surprising, since the Google Play Store has come under fire for years for being a haven for lower-quality apps than what one might find in the iTunes App Store for iPhones. 
 Google said the changes are already being made. ""We recently enhanced our search and discovery algorithms to reflect app quality,"" Google said. ""This results in higher quality apps being surfaced in the Play Store more than similar apps of lower quality (eg: apps that exhibit more frequent crashes).""
This means Android users should start to find higher quality apps promoted based in the app store, and fewer of the 1-star apps that still somehow managed to creep toward the top.

Apple CEO Tim Cook delivers brief remarks as U.S. President Donald Trump (R) and White House Director of the Office of American Innovation and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner listen during a meeting of the American Technology Council in the State Dining Room of the White House June 19, 2017 in Washington, DC.
 The White House has asked the likes of Apple, Amazon, Oracle and Qualcomm to lend some of their digital expertise to Washington, D.C. in the coming months to help the Trump administration  rethink the way that federal agencies use technology.
On a private call with those and other major tech companies Thursday, top advisers to the president, including Jared Kushner, announced the White House would be forming small ""centers of excellence,"" teams focused on reducing regulation while trying to get federal agencies to embrace cloud computing and make more of their data available for private-sector use, according to four sources with knowledge of the matter.
As part of those centers, Kushner and his aides with the Office of American Innovation asked the tech industry for its help — potentially through a system where leading tech engineers can do brief ""tours of duty"" advising the U.S. government on some of its digital challenges.
 For now, the effort is still early, but  the huddle marks the next step for Kushner's effort to modernize government after Trump convened the chief executives of Apple, Facebook, Google and other Silicon Valley staples at the White House in June —  part of the administration's push that month with ""tech week.""

 Trump praises top tech CEOs during summit   
 5:12  PM ET Thu, 22 June 2017 |  01:43 
 Tech leaders who joined the president, like Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, specifically encouraged Trump to make it easier for companies to sell off-the-shelf technologies to the feds. Others, like John Doerr, a top Silicon Valley venture capitalist, touted the need for regulators to release more of their data so that startups — including, perhaps, some of his own — can use those insights in areas like health care.
Two months later, those leaders' representatives joined a Thursday call with the White House, as did officials from Apple, Google, IBM, Intel, Mastercard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP, sources said.

Along with a preview of the administration's new plans to convene ""centers of excellence,"" they heard from Reed Cordish, one of Trump's top tech aides, who pledged that the White House would continue its efforts to boost computer science education. Sources said the administration specifically is exploring how to expand Trump's  recent executive order targeting apprenticeship programs to include K-12 education.
Computer science is an issue Apple CEO Tim Cook raised with the president during tech week: The tech executive specifically floated coding education as a requirement in schools.
For now, though, it's unclear how the White House's newest plan meshes with existing government teams, including 18F, an initiative launched by former President Barack Obama to help the lumbering federal bureaucracy improve the way it buys and uses technology.
A spokesman for Kushner's Office of American Innovation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier Thursday, though, Kushner's office helped Trump unveil a new set of tech tools at the Department of Veterans Affairs — an agency long maligned for its long wait times and tech troubles.
Flanked by Trump at the White House, VA officials demonstrated their new telehealth app, which allows medical professionals in its network to meet and diagnose their veteran patients over video that's streamed to smartphones, tablets or desktop. The system has been in development since last year, and the department will aim to roll it out nationwide over the course of 2017.
""We're launching the mobile app that will allow VA patients to schedule and change their appointments at VA facilities using their smartphones,"" Trump said. ""So this is something they were never able to do. Technology has given us this advantage, but unfortunately we have not taken advantage of that until now.""

 Silicon Valley is trying to out-Trump Donald Trump on jobs. Amazon wants to add tens of thousands of employees to its ranks while Google is donating millions of dollars to training. Touting such plans is partly a response to fears that tech will, like trade, be blamed for killing jobs as automation and artificial intelligence take hold.
Trade became a surprise target during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, symbolizing globalization run amok for both political parties. Trump backed out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership shortly after taking office and has threatened to pull out of NAFTA. Republicans and centrist Democrats who traditionally support trade were caught off guard.
Tech firms are trying to get ahead of potentially similar repercussions. Amazon held a job fair on Wednesday to hire 50,000 workers – and hopes to sign up double that amount by next summer. It also pays for hourly associates to obtain a two-year degree in an in-demand field like medical lab technology or aircraft mechanics.

 Google is in talks to transform its instant news articles into a Snapchat rival, report says   
 5:51  PM ET Fri,  4 Aug 2017 |  00:40 
 Google is talking to several publishers about a technology that's similar to Snapchat's Discover, according to a Friday report in The Wall Street Journal.
 The technology, dubbed ""Stamp,"" could be revealed as soon as next week and contain content from Vox Media, CNN, Mic, The Washington Post and Time, the Journal reported.
Stamp is a wordplay on Google's faster-loading ""AMP"" articles (the news stories that appear at the top of the page after a Google search), and the ""st"" in ""stories,"" according to the Journal. The technology could potentially be very attractive to advertisers, thanks to Google's widespread mobile reach through Android and search.
 ""The success of the open source AMP project is down to the constant collaboration with publishers that involves working early on upcoming features. We don't have anything to announce at the moment but look forward to sharing more soon,"" a Google spokesperson told CNBC.
Snapchat's disappearing publisher content is in a section of the app called ""Discover,"" where short bursts of media content are interspersed with advertisements. Users who come to the app for its messaging features can also interact with advertising through sponsored ""lenses"" or ""geofilters"" that superimpose animation over their images. But Snap's ability to push media content to younger users is a big value proposition of the app, with Snap sealing deals to carry content such as the Winter Olympics.
Both Snap and Google make the majority of their revenue from advertising, though Google is by far the dominant player as Snap struggles with additional competition from Facebook. The ephemeral feature of Snapchat is something Facebook has also mimicked with a feature called ""Stories.""
Snap shares fell sharply after the Wall Street Journal report was released, but remained positive for the day. The Journal report also comes on the heels of an unconfirmed Business Insider report that there were rumors Google was interested in buying Snapchat. Snap was not immediately available to comment.

 In a memo to employees, CEO Sundar Pichai said the employee who penned a controversial memo about how women had biological issues that prevented them from being as successful as men in tech had violated its Code of Conduct and that the post had crossed ""the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.""
He added: ""To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.""
More from Recode:Remember when the iPad was going to be the key to the media business?Benchmark and SoftBank are engaging in some public negotiating jiu jitsu over UberWe're in the early stages of a visual revolution in journalism
 Pichai's wording appears to indicate the employee is likely be fired. Google spokesperson said the company would not confirm any firing, but some sources confirmed to Recode the action was going to take place.
[UPDATE: Sources told Recode that the employee has indeed been fired, but Google said it would not comment on individual employees.]
Once it does happen, the move is sure to attract a firestorm of criticism on both sides, putting the search giant in the crosshairs of a wider debate about gender issues taking place in Silicon Valley and across the country.
The employee memo — which was up for days without action by the company —  went viral within the search giant's internal discussion boards this weekend, with some decrying it and others defending it. Sources said Google's top execs have been struggling with how to deal with it and the fallout, trying to decide if its troubling content crossed a line.
Apparently, it did. In a memo to employees titled ""Our words matter,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the employee — who has been named on Twitter, although his identity could not be verified — had violated its code of conduct. (I am not publishing his name, because he — and others who disagree with him — have been threatened with violence online.
Had the employee not belittled women's skills, I assume, he would not have been fired.
That said, Pichai also noted the memo did raise some important issues, such as the need for more willingness to include more points of view at the company, including more conservative ones.
Wrote Pichai:
""First, let me say that we strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves, and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate, regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it. However, portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace. Our job is to build great products for users that make a difference in their lives. To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK. It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct, which expects 'each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination.'""
It's not an easy line to walk. But the employee penned a piece he sent across the company that said, among other things, that women just can't do tech.
Titled ""Google's Ideological Echo Chamber,"" it begins promisingly enough:
""I value diversity and inclusion, am not denying that sexism exists, and don't endorse using stereotypes. When addressing the gap in representation in the population, we need to look at population level differences in distributions. If we can't have an honest discussion about this, then we can never truly solve the problem.""
But then, in what is pretty much the main premise, he went on in detail: ""I'm simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.""
What followed was a list of those differences, including a claim that women were more social and artistic and could not take the stress of high-pressure jobs. Hence, neuroticism, or higher anxiety and lower stress tolerance.
The author also claimed that he had no voice, even after penning a 3,000-word memo that he was able to send companywide and also was read by millions more. ""Psychological safety is built on mutual respect and acceptance, but unfortunately our culture of shaming and misrepresentation is disrespectful and unaccepting of anyone outside its echo chamber,"" he wrote.
Sources said the memo has caused a massive debate to go on inside Google, which has devolved in ways not unlike those taking place across the country. ""It has been really toxic,"" said one person at Google. ""It's a microcosm of America.""
But what is also true is that free speech is allowed when it comes to the government, but not within companies. In, fact, it is common for people to lose their jobs for making sexist and racist remarks.
Here is the Pichai memo in total:
 From: Sundar Subject: Our words matter This has been a very difficult few days. I wanted to provide an update on the memo that was circulated over this past week. First, let me say that we strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves, and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate, regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it. However, portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace. Our job is to build great products for users that make a difference in their lives. To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK. It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct, which expects ""each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination."" The memo has clearly impacted our co-workers, some of whom are hurting and feel judged based on their gender. Our co-workers shouldn't have to worry that each time they open their mouths to speak in a meeting, they have to prove that they are not like the memo states, being ""agreeable"" rather than ""assertive,"" showing a ""lower stress tolerance,"" or being ""neurotic."" At the same time, there are co-workers who are questioning whether they can safely express their views in the workplace (especially those with a minority viewpoint). They too feel under threat, and that is also not OK. People must feel free to express dissent. So to be clear again, many points raised in the memo — such as the portions criticizing Google's trainings, questioning the role of ideology in the workplace, and debating whether programs for women and underserved groups are sufficiently open to all — are important topics. The author had a right to express their views on those topics — we encourage an environment in which people can do this and it remains our policy to not take action against anyone for prompting these discussions. The past few days have been very difficult for many at the company, and we need to find a way to debate issues on which we might disagree — while doing so in line with our Code of Conduct. I'd encourage each of you to make an effort over the coming days to reach out to those who might have different perspectives from your own. I will be doing the same. I have been on work related travel in Africa and Europe the past couple of weeks and had just started my family vacation here this week. I have decided to return tomorrow as clearly there's a lot more to discuss as a group — including how we create a more inclusive environment for all. So please join me, along with members of the leadership team at a town hall on Thursday. Check your calendar soon for details. — Sundar

 Firestorm erupts over Google employee's anti-diversity memo   
 2:14  PM ET Mon,  7 Aug 2017 |  01:18 
 Comments are pouring in over an internal memo an unnamed male software engineer at Google sent to co-workers on Friday challenging some of the tech giant's diversity efforts, such as mentoring programs open only to people of a certain race or gender. Gizmodo posted the memo on the internet on Saturday and it since has gone viral. The memo contains such provocative statements as:
 ""Women, on average, have more: Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas. Women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than things, relative to men (also interpreted as empathizing vs. systemizing). [¶] These two differences in part explain why women relatively prefer jobs in social or artistic areas. More men may like coding because it requires systemizing and even within SWEs (software engineers), comparatively more women work on front end, which deals with both people and aesthetics."" (Read 10 of the most shocking quotes from thememo.)
Many inside and outside of Google have called for the man's dismissal. However, there are at least three ways the law may keep the company from imposing any discipline.
 First, federal labor law bars even non-union employers like Google from punishing an employee for communicating with fellow employees about improving working conditions. The purpose of the memo was to persuade Google to abandon certain diversity-related practices the engineer found objectionable and to convince co-workers to join his cause, or at least discuss the points he raised.
In a reply to the initial outcry over his memo, the engineer added to his memo: ""Despite what the public response seems to have been, I've gotten many personal messages from fellow Googlers expressing their gratitude for bringing up these very important issues which they agree with but would never have the courage to say or defend because of our shaming culture and the possibility of being fired."" The law protects that kind of ""concerted activity.""
Second, the engineer's memo largely is a statement of his political views as they apply to workplace policies. The memo is styled as a lament to ""Google's Ideological Echo Chamber."" California law prohibits employers from threatening to fire employees to get them to adopt or refrain from adopting a particular political course of action.
Danielle Brown, Google's newly installed vice president of Diversity, Integrity, & Governance, made it clear that the engineer's memo does not reflect ""a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages.""
An employee does not have free reign to engage in political speech that disrupts the workplace, but punishing an employee for deviating from company orthodoxy on a political issue is not allowed either. Brown acknowledged that when she wrote that ""an open, inclusive environment means fostering a culture in which those with alternative views, including different political views, feel safe sharing their opinions.""
Third, the engineer complained in parts of his memo about company policies that he believes violate employment discrimination laws. Those policies include support programs limited by race or gender and promotional and hiring scoring policies that consider race and gender. It is unlawful for an employer to discipline an employee for challenging conduct that the employee reasonably believed to be discriminatory, even when a court later determines the conduct was not actually prohibited by the discrimination laws. In other words, the engineer doesn't have to be right that some of Google's diversity initiatives are unlawful, only that he reasonably believes that they are.
Brown is correct that an employee has no right to engage in workplace discourse that offends anti-discrimination laws; employees may not engage in unlawful harassment under the guise of protected concerted activity or political grievances.
The lawful response to this software engineer's memo, however, appears to be continuation of the dialogue he started rather than termination of his employment.

 Google employees and Silicon Valley pundits are reacting with outrage to a 10-page document written by a Google engineer that criticizes the company's ""left leaning"" culture, taking aim at company policies meant to foster a more diverse workplace.
 The document, which was first reported by Motherboard and published in full by Gizmodo, was reportedly written by a Google senior software engineer named James Damore and went ""viral"" inside the company on Friday. 
It argues that differences in pay between men and women in the technology sector are not entirely related to bias against women, but are partly attributable to biological differences between the genders. It also called on Google to ""stop alienating conservatives"" and calls into question practices like ""unconscious bias"" training for committees that promote employees.
 Several Google employees expressed their outrage about the post on Friday (some of these tweets have since been protected and are no longer visible to the general public):

 Outside commentators have also criticized the company—for instance, Slack engineer Erica Joy. She called attention to alleged unequal pay for women when she worked at Google, and has been an outspoken critic of systematic bias in the tech industry.
 called attention
 Joy wrote that Google execs should ask themselves, ""why is the environment at Google such that racists and sexists feel supported and safe in sharing these views in the company?""
Another former Googler, Yonatan Zunger, who recently left the company, wrote a scathing criticism of the post suggesting that its author didn't understand the basics of engineering -- ""all of these traits which the manifesto described as 'female' are the core traits which make someone successful at engineering"" -- and concluding that the person who wrote it should have been fired immediately.
Google recently hired a VP of diversity, Danielle Brown, who wrote a memo on Saturday responding to the document, Recode reports. She wrote that the document ""advanced incorrect assumptions about gender"" and that ""it's not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages.""
Google parent company Alphabet pointed to Brown's statement as its official comment on the matter.
The document comes as the company is under investigation by the Department of Labor for paying women less than men.
It also fits into a broader story unfolding in Silicon Valley tech companies this year. Company executives and investors have often claimed tech companies are ""meritocracies,"" where hard work and skill are valued and race and gender are ignored. Yet an increasing number of workers in the industry are coming forward with concrete and specific stories of discrimination and harassment.
Uber was rocked by allegations of pervasive discrimination and harassment against women, beginning with a blog post by former engineer Susan Fowler in February. Her story culminated in the resignation or firing of many top executives, including CEO Travis Kalanick, who stepped aside in June.
More recently, several venture capitalists have left their posts after women accused them of making inappropriate advances in business scenarios.

Larry Page
 Google and Uber mulled teaming up on self-driving car technology, but the relationship iced over, former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said in a deposition published this weekend.
 The deposition centers on an ongoing lawsuit between Alphabet's self-driving car unit Waymo (formerly all under Google) and Uber. The tech giants are fighting over whether a star self-driving car engineer, Anthony Levandowski, stole and used a Google technology at Uber.
But the hours-long deposition also sheds light on the disintegration of the relationship between Uber and one of its biggest investors, Google. Google Ventures reportedly about $250 million in Uber in 2013, one of its largest deals at the time, giving Kalanick wide range to do whatever he pleased. 
 Since then, though, Uber and Google have shifted from partners to a ""cold war."" The companies are not only involved in this lawsuit, but Waymo recently agreed to team up with Uber's arch-rival, Lyft, to help bring self-driving cars to market.
Here are some events that Kalanick said splintered the relationship between the two companies: 
Google told Uber it was getting serious about ride-sharing. David Drummond, a senior vice president at Google and former board member at Uber, agreed to ""recuse himself from board meetings"" around October 2014, according to Kalanick.
""He said that Google is intending to compete with Uber in the ridesharing space. And that the efforts were substantive enough and serious enough that he felt compelled to tell us that that was happening.""
Kalanick continued, ""I don't remember my exact words, but I remember feeling disappointed a little bit, a little burned by the relationship.""
Kalanick was concerned that a start-up called Argo AI, founded by an ex-Googler, was trying to collect intel to feed back to Google. Uber began talking to Anthony Levandowski, a star Google engineer, in late 2015, and Levandowski started spending more time with him in early 2016.
During the same period, Uber was also looking at acquiring another start-up run by an ex-Google employee with the last name ""Salesky,"" (presumably Brian Salesky of Argo AI, which later took a big investment from Ford, although the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment).
""Lots of people were looking to leave Google at this time. And most of their top people were leaving,"" Kalanick said. But Kalanick said he was ""quite worried"" that Salesky was still in communication with Google co-founder Larry Page.
""Because Salesky was — my understanding — again, I've never met him, but my understanding of the meetings they had with him, you could never quite trust him. And so he was talking to us about working with us in some way. We weren't sure if he was talking to us about working with us or talking to us and then going back to Google and telling him — telling them everything that he learned by talking us,"" Kalanick said.
Waymo exec sent an e-mail trashing the engineers Uber acquired with Otto. When Uber ultimately decided to acquire Levandowski's start-up, Otto, in 2016, Kalanick said that his then-deputy, Emil Michael, received a ""lowbrow"" email from Waymo CEO John Krafcik, insulting the qualifications of the former Google employees that Uber had acquired.
""It's strange for a leader to talk trash on the people that he hired just because they leave and work somewhere else,"" Kalanick said.
Waymo and Alphabet were cool to a partnership. Nonetheless, Drummond, Krafcik and Kalanick met in Mountain View during the same summer that Otto was acquired to see if they could put a partnership together between Waymo and Uber, according to Kalanick.
""I think it was the first time we were meeting Krafcik. He gave us a tour of the -- some of the facility, and then we spent the conversation with us talking -- you know, myself and Emil talking about our ideas for how we could partner. And Krafcik really sort of not deeply engaging in the -- in the conversation,"" Kalanick said.
Kalanick said he was ""constantly making a pitch to partner with them,"" something that Drummond had advocated for.
""He was a big believer it was the right thing. I was a big believer it was the right thing. I could get my company behind that. David couldn't get — couldn't get, you know, Larry [Page] and other folks and just Google, essentially, behind that notion,"" Kalanick said.
Larry Page got paranoid about Uber stealing their IP. In October of 2016, Kalanick said he asked Page to call him to talk about ""flying cars,"" an area of technology that Uber is interested in, and that Page has invested in through a start-up called Kitty Hawk.
But Kalanick said he also wanted to discuss partnering on driverless cars.
Kalanick's pitch was ""was very similar to all the considerations I have had over the years, which is: You guys have -- you guys have been working on this quite a while. You have great expertise. We have developing expertise, but we haven't been in this industry as long. We certainly have a lot of ridesharing things going on. There could be a really interesting .... potential in partnering those two efforts.""
But Page still didn't seem interested, and was a bit upset, suggesting they could discuss it again at the beginning of 2017, according to Kalanick.

 In the piece, entitled ""Google's Ideological Echo Chamber,"" a software engineer who works at the Mountain View, California, headquarters tries to make the case that women are underrepresented in tech because of biological differences. (The original memo reportedly uses sources from Wikipedia to The Estonian Centre for Behavioural and Health Sciences to WordPress blogs to The Atlantic and The Wall Street Journal.)
The document has been met with a lot of public anger, but the author says he has received many secret notes of gratitude, too, from fellow Google employees afraid to express their similar perspectives.
 Here are 12 of the most divisive quotes, though there are plenty more where these came from.
1. ""Differences in distributions of traits between men and women may in part explain why we don't have 50 percent representation of women in tech and leadership. Discrimination to reach equal representation is unfair, divisive, and bad for business.""

 });
 2. The author says Google leans toward liberal and that ""political orientation is actually a result of deep moral preferences and thus biases."" He breaks down those ""prejudices"" as follows: ""Left Biases: Compassion for the weak, Disparities are due to injustices, Humans are inherently cooperative, Change is good (unstable), Open, Idealist. Right Biases: Respect for the strong/authority, Disparities are natural and just, Humans are inherently competitive, Change is dangerous (stable), Closed, Pragmatic.""

 3:09  PM ET Thu, 10 Aug 2017 |  03:56 
 3. ""On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren't just socially constructed because: They're universal across human cultures, they often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone, biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify and act like males."" 
4. ""I'm simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.""
5. ""Women, on average, have more: Neuroticism (higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance). This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs.""
6. ""We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism.""
7. ""Women on average show a higher interest in people and men in things."" 
8. ""Women on average look for more work-life balance while men have a higher drive for status on average. Unfortunately, as long as tech and leadership remain high status, lucrative careers, men may disproportionately want to be in them. Allowing and truly endorsing (as part of our culture) part time work though can keep more women in tech.""
9. ""I strongly believe in gender and racial diversity, and I think we should strive for more. However, to achieve a more equal gender and race representation, Google has created several discriminatory practices: Programs, mentoring, and classes only for people with a certain gender or race, a high priority queue and special treatment for 'diversity' candidates, hiring practices which can effectively lower the bar for 'diversity' candidates by decreasing the false negative rate.""
10. ""We're told by senior leadership that what we're doing is both the morally and economically correct thing to do, but without evidence this is just veiled left ideology that can irreparably harm Google.""
11. ""My concrete suggestions are to: De-moralize diversity. As soon as we start to moralize an issue, we stop thinking about it in terms of costs and benefits, dismiss anyone that disagrees as immoral, and harshly punish those we see as villains to protect the 'victims.'""
12. The author runs through several other suggestions on how to solve the current culture of, as he sees it, intolerance to conservative ways of thinking about gender dynamics at the Google: ""Be open about the science of human nature. Once we acknowledge that not all differences are socially constructed or due to discrimination, we open our eyes to a more accurate view of the human condition which is necessary if we actually want to solve problems.""
 ""You have just created a textbook hostile workplace environment.""
-Yonatan Zunger, former Google executive
 Google's vice president of diversity, Danielle Brown, responded to the memo saying the viewpoint expressed was not in line with that of the company. ""We are unequivocal in our belief that diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company, and we'll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long haul,"" she says.
A Google executive, Yonatan Zunger, who left the company for unrelated issues after 14 years, commented on the memo publicly too. He says that the idea that engineering is not a cooperative, people-driven field is false.
""All of these traits which the manifesto described as 'female' are the core traits which make someone successful at engineering,""  Zunger says in a Medium post. ""All of which is why the conclusions of this manifesto are precisely backwards. It's true that women are socialized to be better at paying attention to people's emotional needs and so on — this is something that makes them better engineers, not worse ones.""
Zunger also says that the comments hurt Google. They damage the reputation of Google and also create an environment where women question their ability. ""I am no longer even at the company and I've had to spend half of the past day talking to people and cleaning up the mess you've made. I can't even imagine how much time and emotional energy has been sunk into this, not to mention reputational harm more broadly,"" he says. 
""You have just created a textbook hostile workplace environment.""
In his previous role at Google, had the author been in his reporting chain, Zunger says, he would have called a meeting with the author of the memo to inform him that his behavior was not acceptable. That meeting ""would have ended with you being escorted from the building by security and told that your personal items will be mailed to you.""
This story has been updated to include new information on the sourcing of the memo.

 Cryptocurrency skeptics warn of another dot-com bubble, but remember: That's where Amazon and Google started   
 12:54  PM ET Mon,  7 Aug 2017 |  00:40 
 Oaktree's Howard Marks sounded a general alarm last week about the state of stock markets, private equity, credit markets and — for good measure — new digital currencies like bitcoin and ethereum. Essentially, he wrote in his letter to investors that everything is overvalued.
 On the cryptocurrencies, he went further. He stated several times that they're ""not real."" Furthermore, he said, they are ""nothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme).""
Cryptocurrencies may indeed be in the biggest valuation bubble since the dot-com era.
 At the same time, there is undeniable excitement about their potential today among the top tier of venture capital investors.
Former PayPal COO David Sacks, who was also an early investor in Airbnb, Facebook, Palantir, SpaceX and Uber, tweeted last week that cryptos are the best candidate we've had for the next big thing in Silicon Valley (Web 3.0):
 https://twitter.com/DavidSacks/status/892177178917351424
 When I read Marks' comments about bitcoin not being real, I thought back to  an interview I did with the CEO of McEwen Mining four years ago:
 Any currency exists only because at least two parties (a buyer and a seller) agree that it represents value. So, what constitutes money? On a South Pacific island, we might agree that chicken bones are a currency. In prison, we might agree that cigarettes are a currency. Today, while we all use fiat or paper currencies as money, a medium of exchange, there is a growing concern about the value of these pieces of paper. I don't see why Bitcoin can't also grow and become another viable currency, an internet based currency. If enough people accept it, it will be used. It seems to have momentum behind it and it's intriguing how it's truly separate from any country or central banks' manipulation and control. There will be growing pains, like the guy who lost money out of his electronic wallet because he left his computer on all night. Also, Bitcoin will spawn competitors, alternative digital currencies. I think it's a mistake to write off this currency as a bubble or fad. Will it threaten gold? I don't think so. I think the two will grow in tandem as alternative currencies to fiat currencies. 
In the dot-com era of the late '90s, there were many warning signs of a huge bubble that was about to pop including:
 Few of the dot coms had profitable business models Business schools (like Columbia where I was in the late '90s) that typically churned out MBAs going into consulting or banking now had students joining start-ups Taxi drivers were asking about hot stocks People had full-time jobs day trading like CMGI (as Marks himself pointed out  in this Jan. 2, 2000, letter to investors) 
By contrast, few people are quitting their jobs to start cryptocurrency companies (yet). Day trading is rare. Taxi drivers aren't asking about bitcoin.
If cryptocurrencies are a bubble, we're still in the early innings.
But there are signs of frothiness:
 Initial coin offerings this year have raised $1.27 billion. ICO podcasts are abundant with new episodes weekly with guests claiming their new coin is going to revolutionize some new niche area. And now you have respected investor Marks saying: ""But they're not real!!!!!"" 
Bitcoin in 2017 is as real as Amazon or Priceline was in 1999.
Both those great companies had their stocks get killed when the dot-com bubble burst, but they used the nuclear winter they faced in the next few years to make themselves more profitable and take market share that they would never give back.
Amazon dropped from $76 per share (in today's post-split share value) at the end of 1999 to less than $6 after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Amazon trades now over $1,000/share.
Priceline went from $283 a share at the end of 1999 to less than $8 three years later. Today, it trades above $2,000.
No doubt many of this year's batch of ICOs, as well as dozens of other existing cryptocurrencies, will disappear in the coming years as things settle out.
But if you listen to Marks' advice and tune out the crypto space, you'll miss the ICO equivalents of Amazon and Priceline. Will ethereum be the next Google? Or the next Lycos?
More importantly, what will be the magnitude of growth from here? Bitcoin has grown from nothing to nearly $3,000 today (after a big pullback when it first hit $1,000 a few years ago). But where will it be in five, 10 or 15 years from now? And will it pull back to below $1,000 again before it breaks out to new highs?
To discard all cryptocurrencies as Marks did in his letter would be a big mistake. There is real value in these digital currencies.

 Firestorm erupts over Google employee's anti-diversity memo   
 2:14  PM ET Mon,  7 Aug 2017 |  01:18 
 Google is teaching girls that their path to ""financial freedom"" lies in ""complaining to HR,"" the managing director of a Peter Thiel investment fund said on Tuesday, drawing sharp criticism on social media. 
 The comments, made by Eric Weinstein, the managing director of Thiel Capital, come after Google fired engineer James Damore for circulating a memo that argued biological differences were the reason for the shortage of women at the company.
Many employees in Google were outraged by the memo. One employee Jaana Dogan, took to Twitter saying that she would leave the company if HR does nothing. The tweet was later deleted.
 Weinstein was not directly referencing Dogan in his tweet, but appeared to take issue with women who went to HR to raise their concerns. 
 TWEET
 Weinstein's tweet drew criticism from others in the technology industry. Venture capitalist Villi Iltchev, who works at August Capital, said he was ""upset"" by Weinstein's tweet.
 TWEET
 Weinstein offered another analogy, as he continued tweeting on the issue.
 TWEET
 And then the Thiel Capital managing director likened Damore's dismissal from Google to firing a biologist for making a factual comment on biology but accusing him of sexual harassment.
 TWEET
 The ""SRY protein"" is responsible for determining the sex of a person.
A Google spokesperson pointed towards a statement released by CEO Sundar Pichai on Tuesday explaining the decision to fire the engineer, and trying to reassure staff that they can freely express their views.
""First, let me say that we strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves, and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate, regardless of whether a vast majority of Googlers disagree with it,"" Pichai wrote in a memo.
""However, portions of the memo violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace. Our job is to build great products for users that make a difference in their lives. To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.""
Google, like many tech firms, has been grappling with issues around discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor accused Google of pay discrimination earlier this year, a charge the search giant has denied. 
The broader technology industry has also been rocked by a number of scandals related to discrimination and sexual harassment. These include claims of sexual harassment by prominent venture capitalists as well as the high-profile resignation of former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, in part because of accusations of discrimination at the ride-hailing service.

 ""It's time to stop making mountains out of molehills. If men are from Mars, it looks like women are too,"" Grant says, riffing off the iconic book ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.""
The New York Times bestselling author  published a piece via LinkedIn on Monday in response to the controversial memo written by Google software engineer James Damore. Damore's manifesto claimed biological differences between the sexes are the reason women are so underrepresented in the tech industry. The diatribe was first circulated internally at Google but has now gone viral.

 ""It's always precarious to make claims about how one half of the population differs from the other half — especially on something as complicated as technical skills and interests. But I think it's a travesty when discussions about data devolve into name-calling and threats. As a social scientist, I prefer to look at the evidence,"" Grant says.

 In his memo, Damore, who has since been fired but is ""exploring all possible legal remedies"" to his dismissal, linked to sources ranging from Wikipedia, The Estonian Centre for Behavioural and Health Sciences and WordPress blogs to The Atlantic and The Wall Street Journal. 
However, Grant says, ""The gold standard is a meta-analysis: a study of studies, correcting for biases in particular samples and measures."" 
When you look at that data, he says, the psychological differences between men and women are not significant.
""Across 128 domains of the mind and behavior, '78 percent of gender differences are small or close to zero,'"" says Grant. ""A recent addition to that list is leadership, where men feel more confident but women are rated as more competent,"" Grant writes, linking to the American Psychological Association.
 Gender differences in ability and motivation are mostly small or zero.#GoogleManifesto #ActualData:https://t.co/Tyxncmcgz0 pic.twitter.com/xbTOnY5APU— Adam Grant (@AdamMGrant) August 7, 2017
 Grant also points to a survey of 4,000 studies showing that men and women have equal capabilities in math. The difference is, from a young age, boys are encouraged to be successful at the subject, Grant says.
""When teachers know students' names, boys do better on math tests. Yet when grading is anonymous, girls do better on math tests,"" he explains.
""And before a math test, reminding college students of their gender leads girls to perform 43 percent worse than boys. But if you just call it a problem-solving test, the  gender gap in performance disappears.""
In fact, says Grant, ""There are only a handful of areas with large sex differences: men are physically stronger and more physically aggressive, masturbate more, and are more positive on casual sex. So you can make a case for having more men than women … if you're fielding a sports team or collecting semen.""
So what does account for the imbalance of men and women at major tech companies, not just at Google?
It is at least partially a result of social pressures, Grant says.
""Women have systematically been discouraged from  working with computers. Look at trends in  college majors: since the 1980s, the proportion of female majors has gone up in science and medicine and law, but down in computer science,"" Grant writes, linking to a meta-analysis of psychological studies and an NPR report.
 Grant's post got support from perhaps the most famous woman in tech, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who is also Grant's ""Option B"" co-author. She re-posted his LinkedIn article on her personal Facebook page with the comment: ""Inequality in tech isn't due to gender differences. It's due to cultural stereotypes that persist. We all need to do more.""

 Google CEO Sundar Pichai cut his vacation short to address the flap over fired engineer   
 4:53  PM ET Tue,  8 Aug 2017 |  00:56 
 Memo in reply to the former Google engineer who wrote that diversity memo: Don't cause a public relations crisis when the boss is trying to take a family vacation.
 Google fired James Damore after he posted a memo to an internal message board that started as a straightforward complaint about company practices but veered into remarks about innate biological differences between men and women that Google management later ruled were sexist and offensive to his co-workers.
The memo created a firestorm the same weekend that Google CEO Sundar Pichai was preparing to take a family vacation after returning from a work trip to Africa.
 His lengthy communication also came soon after the arrival at Google of Danielle Mastrangel Brown, vice president and chief diversity and inclusion officer, who until June held that same post at Intel, according to her LinkedIn profile.
Google hired Brown to boost its efforts to hire more women and other minorities, so few of whom work at the internet giant that the U.S. Department of Labor has taken it to court over the issue.
Damore's LinkedIn profile shows that he did well enough as a Google intern in the summer of 2013 to get hired in December of that year as an engineer, a position he held until this week.
He also has a notable educational and professional background, according to the LinkedIn profile, with time spent at institutions like Harvard, MIT and Princeton.
He may be less familiar, though, with the Tao Te Ching, the 2,500-year-old book of philosophy revered in parts of Asia for nuggets of wisdom like this: ""In action, watch the timing.""
At the end of his prepared remarks on a July 24 conference call, Pichai took the time to say this:
""I want to express a very sincere thank you to every Googler who worked tirelessly this quarter to bring all of our technology and products to the world.""
That was right after he revealed that he would be traveling to Africa for a ""'Google for Nigeria'"" event to announce new products for Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa,"" a trip Pichai called ""another highlight for me.""
 Details on Pichai's decision
 Upon returning from that trip, according to a memo he sent to Google employees and posted on Google's corporate blog, Pichai planned to vacation in California with his family.
Instead, he will on Thursday lead an all-hands meeting to discuss the incident, whose memo Pichai described as ""advancing harmful gender stereotypes"" at the company.
""I have been on work related travel in Africa and Europe the past couple of weeks and had just started my family vacation here this week. I have decided to return tomorrow as clearly there's a lot more to discuss as a group — including how we create a more inclusive environment for all.""
In his memo, Pichai laid out in detail what was unacceptable in Damore's post:
""To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK. It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct, which expects 'each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination.'""
Pichai did so even while he credited Damore with raising important topics:
""So to be clear again, many points raised in the memo — such as the portions criticizing Google's trainings, questioning the role of ideology in the workplace, and debating whether programs for women and underserved groups are sufficiently open to all — are important topics.""
""The author had a right to express their views on those topics — we encourage an environment in which people can do this and it remains our policy to not take action against anyone for prompting these discussions.""
In the end, however, Pichai concluded by expressing an ideal that Damore's memo fell short of.
""We need to find a way to debate issues on which we might disagree — while doing so in line with our Code of Conduct,"" Pichai wrote.
Alphabet did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and Damore could not be reached for comment.

 });An internal memo written by a male Google engineer has reignited a heated debate about representation in Silicon Valley. Google's new diversity VP has since come out against the memo's central claims — which include statements about women being biologically unsuited to engineering jobs — but the debate still rages on.
Here's a look at major tech companies' comparative diversity, according to their most recent reports. Women make up at most 30 percent of leadership roles and less than 27 percent of technical roles at these companies.

 Twitter, the smallest company by number of employees, has the highest rate of female leadership at 30 percent. It also has the lowest rate of women in technical positions, such as engineers at 15 percent.
Racial demographics aren't much brighter.

 Blacks and Latinx are represented at a much lower rate than their U.S. population. Facebook, which most recently reported new diversity numbers, had the highest share of people of color, particularly Asians, in technology jobs. Asian Americans tend to be overrepresented in technical roles but underrepresented in leadership positions.

Three workers at Google Inc. in Silicon Valley
 Amazon, Apple and Google all had 31 percent of their leadership consisting of Asian, Latinx and blacks. These companies also report ""other"" and people who are two or more races, but those are usually under two percent.
Inequality exists at all levels of the job pipeline, but so do solutions. Look, for example, at the record number of women and minorities taking college-level computer science in high school this year.

 Comments now are pouring in over the termination on Monday of Google software engineer James Damore, who sent a memo to co-workers on Friday challenging some of the tech giant's diversity efforts, such as mentoring programs open only to people of a certain race or gender.
 Gizmodo posted the memo on the internet on Saturday and it since has gone viral. The memo contained provocative statements suggesting that women were ""generally"" biologically, temperamentally, or motivationally less suited for positions as software engineers or tech leaders than men are. (Read 10 of the most shocking quotes from the memo.)
Many inside and outside of Google called for Damore's dismissal. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said that Damore was fired for ""advancing harmful gender stereotypes"" in the memo. Google may have had the legal right to fire Damore for that reason, notwithstanding the ways some of what Damore said in his memo was legally protected.
 As an initial matter, Damore almost certainly was an at-will employee (meaning, he probably doesn't have a special contract). That means that Google could terminate his employment for any reason that did not offend fundamental public policy, such as the laws against discrimination, or no cause at all.
Google had the right to fire Damore for what the company perceived to be sexually harassing behavior, even if the comments did not so alter the workplace of female Google employees that it made Damore's comments legally actionable sexual harassment. Google cited its code of conduct that prohibits behavior beyond what the law prohibits.
Here is why the areas of the law that protected some of Damore's memo may not be enough to give him legal recourse against the company.
 ""Damore will face a steep legal hurdle attempting to show that he was terminated because of illegal motives and not a lawful one.""
 First, federal labor law does, indeed, bar even non-union employers like Google from punishing an employee for communicating with fellow employees about improving working conditions. The purpose of the memo was to persuade Google to abandon certain diversity-related practices the engineer found objectionable and to convince co-workers to join his cause, or at least discuss the points he raised. But no evidence has surfaced so far that Google fired Damore for engaging in this protected activity in terminating his employment. Instead, the company cited what it considered Damore's unprotected activity in making its decision. Damore may be unable to meet his challenging burden of showing otherwise.
Second, Damore's memo was styled as a lament to ""Google's Ideological Echo Chamber."" Damore's comments about his perceived marginalization as a conservative in a predominantly liberal corporate culture arguably were protected by California law that prohibits employers from threatening to fire employees to get them to adopt or refrain from adopting a particular political course of action.
Google CEO Sundar Pichai recognized that when he said in his memo to employees that ""we strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves, and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate. . . ."" But Damore went beyond that and that the memo contained protected speech may not have precluded Google from taking action on what was not protected. Google may be expected to assert that it fired Damore not to silence a dissenter, but to expel a harasser.
Third, the engineer complained in parts of his memo about company policies that he believes violate employment discrimination laws. Those policies include support programs limited by race or gender and promotional and hiring scoring policies that consider race and gender. It is unlawful for an employer to discipline an employee for challenging conduct that the employee reasonably believed to be discriminatory, even when a court later determines the conduct was not actually prohibited by the discrimination laws. In other words, the engineer doesn't have to be right that some of Google's diversity initiatives are unlawful, only that he reasonably believes that they are.
All of that is true, but it also is true that there is no evidence that Google terminated Damore for those aspects of his memo. In any challenge to this termination, Google's non-retaliatory motive will matter. To be more precise, it is the motive of the people who made the decision to fire Damore, not those in the company who may have other reasons potentially tainted with illegality, that will matter.
Google Vice President of Diversity, Inclusion & Governance Danielle Brown is correct that an employee has no right to engage in workplace discourse that offends anti-discrimination laws; employees may not engage in unlawful harassment under the guise of protected concerted activity or political grievances.
If that is what motivated Google is terminating Damore, the termination may not be legally actionable.
One response Google could have taken to Damore's memo was continuation of the dialogue. Google chose termination of his employment instead. Damore will face a steep legal hurdle attempting to show that he was terminated because of illegal motives and not a lawful one.

 });Over the weekend James Damore, a software engineer at Google, shared a 10-page manifesto in which he argues that men are scientifically predisposed to being better leaders, better at technology and better Google employees.
 Damore confirmed in an email to Reuters on Monday that he had been fired for ""perpetuating gender stereotypes,"" but his controversial memo — and subsequent termination — has sparked a contentious discussion on sexism in the workplace, drawing commentary from those in the tech industry and beyond.
Here's what six leaders had to say about the arguments the former Google employee advanced:

 Adam Grant
 In a LinkedIn post, Wharton's Adam Grant eviscerated the Google memo, using his academic background to deconstruct Damore's mathematical conclusions and explain that the differences between men and women are slim to none.
""It's always precarious to make claims about how one-half of the population differs from the other half — especially on something as complicated as technical skills and interests. But I think it's a travesty when discussions about data devolve into name-calling and threats. As a social scientist, I prefer to look at the evidence,"" Grant writes.

 ""Across 128 domains of the mind and behavior, '78 percent of gender differences are small or close to zero.'"" The only major differences, he says, are related to physical stature and sexual proclivities.

Anita Hill
 Anita Hill
 In an op-ed for  The New York Times, Brandeis University professor of Social Policy, Law, and Women's Studies Anita Hill characterized the Google memo as an unveiling of the true nature of the tech industry.
She writes, ""The recent leak of a Google engineer's screed against the company's diversity initiatives is a reminder that the notion of Silicon Valley as the seat of human progress is a myth — at least when it comes to way the women behind the latest in technology are treated.""
Hill argues that the tech industry has been hiding behind a false veil of progressivism and that this memo serves as a revelation that should encourage class action lawsuits to fight discrimination.
""The tech industry is stuck in the past, more closely resembling 'Mad Men'-era Madison Avenue or 1980s Wall Street than a modern egalitarian society. It may take the force of our legal system to change that,"" she writes.

Glenn Beck

 Conservative radio host Glenn Beck said that critics are ""ignoring basic science"" and describes Google as a ""Corporate Fascist.""
Beck argues that firing Damore for authoring the memo is a form of discrimination and equates being fired with slavery.
""How do you fix discrimination with discrimination?"" he asks. ""That's like, 'We're going to stop all these slave owners. We're going to enslave all the slave owners. And the slaves can own the slave owners.'""

 Google's new Vice President of Diversity, Integrity & Governance, Danielle Brown, wrote a response to Damore's memo saying that it ""advanced incorrect assumptions about gender"" and that ""it's not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages.""
She also added that it is important that Google employees ""feel safe sharing their opinions. But that discourse needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our Code of Conduct, policies and anti-discrimination laws.""

 Kara Swisher
 Technology journalist and Recode co-founder Kara Swisher has followed the controversy closely. When Eric Weinstein, managing director of Thiel Capital, took to Twitter to complain about Damore being fired, Swisher swiftly responded.
Weinstein carped that Google should, ""Stop teaching my girl that her path to financial freedom lies not in coding but in complaining to HR.""
Swisher responded to Weinstein's tweet saying, ""Stop teaching my boys that their path to decency lies not in coding but in denigrating women.""

 Google CEO Sundar Pichai cut a family vacation short to address the controversy. In an email to Google employees on Monday Pichai wrote: ""Our job is to build great products for users that make a difference in their lives. To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.""
The CEO says that this is just the beginning of a larger conversation. ""Clearly there's a lot more to discuss as a group,"" he wrote. ""Including how we create a more inclusive environment for all.""

 Highest-paying jobs for women

 The memo comes at a time where the U.S. gender pay gap for full-time, year-round workers has proven stubbornly persistent at about 20 percent. Although millennial women are reportedly getting closer to earning what their male counterparts do, historically young women's earnings peak at about 90 percent of what their male peers earn and then go down as they age.
Many experts argue that the gap may not be entirely closed until 2152.
""When I saw the memo that circulated last week,"" writes Wojcicki, ""I once again felt that pain, and empathized with the pain it must have caused others.""
As the CEO wrote in an Op-Ed for Vanity Fair in March, she remains ""frustrated that an industry so quick to embrace and change the future can't break free of its regrettable past.""

Tim Cook was the second highest-paid executive of 2016, pulling in $150,036,907
 Would you trust a technology company like Apple, Amazon or Google with your health data?
 More than 1,000 people participated in my Twitter poll on the topic, and the majority of people responded that they would. Only 37 percent of people responded that they would not share their data.
Among those who opted to share their health data with a tech company, one clear winner emerged: Apple. 
 #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(""dw-chart"");$(window).on(""orientationchange"",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});});
 It has been two years since the research firm Rock Health surveyed the American public and found that most people would not trust a tech company with their data. Only about 8 percent said they would share their health information. 
This poll isn't comparable. It was entirely unscientific in nature, and did not represent a diverse swath of the public. The majority of my Twitter followers work in the technology and health sectors. 
Still, privacy experts say there is something revealing in the results. In their experience, sentiment does seem to be changing around the major tech companies, particularly Apple.
""Apple has done a big push around health and privacy to breed familiarity and comfort,"" said Andrew Boyd, a professor of biomedical and health information sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
As Boyd points out, Apple has shared plans to aggregate health information on the phone so users can share it -- with consent. And as CNBC reported, the company plans to followup by integrating other types of medical data, like clinical labs, which have historically been scattered across hospitals and clinics. 
The company has made repeated assurances to users that it will not sell health data to advertisers. That policy extends to third-party developers. 
The company also went up against the FBI in refusing to help the agency unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter, which some interpreted as a move to protect privacy and security.
As Apple CEO Tim Cook told NPR: ""Some of our most personal data is on the phone - our financial data, our health information, our conversations with our friends and family and coworkers. And so instead of us taking that data into Apple, we've kept data on the phone, and it's encrypted by you. You control it.""
That message seems to have resonated with users -- and with privacy experts. 
""I voted for Apple because their brand, to date, has a stronger privacy foundation than other options (Google and Amazon),"" said Lucia Savage, chief privacy and regulatory offer at a start-up called Omada Health and the former chief privacy officer for the Department of Health and Human Services.
Savage stressed that all health data collection companies, including tech giants, should adopt minimum protections: To provide a summary of the data collected about their users, and to agree not to sell it.
Other privacy experts note that these companies collect a lot of health-related data that is not protected by rules that govern how companies can share and store medical information, like HIPAA.
""If you buy condoms from Amazon, your purchase history is not protected health information under HIPAA; your Dr. Google search history is not, nor is Strava location data,"" said Chas Ballew, a regulatory lawyer and the co-founder of a start-up called Aptible.
So does Apple deserve the top spot?
Well, perhaps for now.
Boyd points out that it's impossible to know if any of these companies -- Apple, Amazon, Google -- will still be thriving decades from now. If they run into financial problems, ""the data will be one of their most lucrative remaining assets,"" he said.

 Kara Swisher: Victimization of white men in Silicon Valley is exhausting   
 3:09  PM ET Thu, 10 Aug 2017 |  03:56 
 In an update to leadership development firm Zenger Folkman's 2012 survey data published in the Harvard Business Review, company president Joe Folkman provided CNBC Make It the results of the company's latest survey.
Folkman is a psychometrician, or a psychologist with a specialty in computer science and statistics, who designed a tool to measure leadership effectiveness. The firm notes that although more women have been entering the U.S. workforce and contributing growth to the nation's GDP, women remain an untapped resource.

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 The following results from Zenger Folkman's research demonstrate three ways the former Google employee's anti-diversity memo is wrong about women in leadership:
 Incorrect claim #1: Women are passive and don't take initiative
 Damore claims that women express their extroversion as ""gregariousness rather than assertiveness.""
""This leads to women generally having a harder time negotiating salary, asking for raises, speaking up and leading,"" he writes in the memo.
On the contrary, Folkman's research found that female leaders rank the highest in their ability to take initiative and drive for results.
 ""The assumptions in the memo were that women are more passive, but taking initiative and being results-driven doesn't sound passive to me. It sounds like they're very assertive, they get stuff done and they make things happen,"" Folkman says.
In total, women scored higher than men in 13 out of the 16 leadership competencies, tying only for their tendency to be innovative.
 Incorrect claim #2: Neuroticism and lack of drive impede women's career growth
 Although he says ""Google is already making strides in many of these areas,"" Damore claims more women would hold tech and leadership jobs if these fields weren't as stressful.
While men scored higher than women in their tendencies to have technical/professional expertise and develop strategic perspectives, Folkman points out this may be due to women's comparably lower confidence in their trades.
""Are women naturally less confident? Probably not. But if in a situation where people are doubting you or questioning your abilities, that would even make me less confident,"" Folkman says. ""I think it's more about the company culture that creates that lack of confidence.""
 Incorrect claim #3: Empathy steers women away from coding jobs
 Folkman points out that if women at Google actually do feel such stress or lack of confidence in their work, it's likely less about their technical abilities and more about company culture.
""In organizations where women don't feel like second-class citizens and they don't feel abused, they actually feel empowered. They feel like they're taken seriously and like they have a future there,"" Folkman says.
This assumption that women perform best in nurturing roles ""just puts women in a box."" If anything, their ability to empathize further sets them up for leadership roles, he says.
""A great leader can connect with people, and we find that as leaders progress in an organization, their ability to empathize and understand people is absolutely critical for a senior executive,"" Folkman says. ""If a leader doesn't do that, they don't get the kind of engagement and commitment from employees.""

 Recode Op-Ed: How Google CEO Sundar Pichai decided to fire James Damore   
 6:11  PM ET Thu, 10 Aug 2017 |  00:56 
 Google's CEO Sundar Pichai has cancelled its much anticipated meeting to talk about gender issues today, after its employees expressed concern over online harassment they had begin to receive when their questions and names have been published outside the company on a variety of largely alt-right sites.
Pichai was set to address the search giant's 60,000 employees in 30 minutes in an all-hands meeting about a recent post by fired employee James Damore, in which he claimed that women might not be as good as men at tech due to biological reasons, like ""neuroticism."" In other words, they could not handle stress and high pressure as much.
Speaking of high pressure, Google is under that for sure in the wake of Damore's blog and the reaction it has engendered from outside the company, especially among deeply conservative sites like Breitbart and others.
 Here is Pichai's letter:
 Dear Googlers, TL;DR Sorry for the late notice but we are going to cancel today's Town Hall. We had hoped to have a frank, open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward. But our Dory questions appeared externally this afternoon, and on some websites Googlers are now being named personally. Googlers are writing in, concerned about their safety and worried they may be ""outed"" publicly for asking a question in the Town Hall. In recognition of Googlers' concerns, we need to step back and create a better set of conditions for us to have the discussion. So in the coming days we will find several forums to gather and engage with Googlers, where people can feel comfortable to speak freely. We'll share details soon. Over the past two days, I have had the chance to meet with so many people here, and I have read each of your emails carefully. The vast majority of you are very supportive of our decision. A smaller percentage of you wish we would do more. And some are worried that you cannot speak out at work freely. All of your voices and opinions matter...and I want to hear them. In the meantime, let's not forget what unites us as a company-- our desire to build great products for everyone that make a big difference in their lives. I have been in a few product discussions today and felt energized by the important things we are working on. We can, and will continue, to come together to do the very best for the people we serve. Stay tuned. Sundar

 6:11  PM ET Thu, 10 Aug 2017 |  00:56 
 Let's all assume Google CEO Sundar Pichai has a really hard day ahead of him.
That's because at 4 pm PT, the tech giant will hold an all-hands meeting to discuss the firing of James Damore and the controversial internal memo he wrote about women and their biological weaknesses related to tech that  got him canned.
The gathering will take place at Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. today and streamed live to its global offices, reaching the 60,000 employees that the Alphabet unit employs. Since many will not be at work when the meeting takes place, it will also be available for replay.

 Kara Swisher: Victimization of white men in Silicon Valley is exhausting   
 3:09  PM ET Thu, 10 Aug 2017 |  03:56 
 One thing is clear: It will be one of the biggest public challenges the cerebral, soft-spoken and — in my experience — unfailingly thoughtful executive will face in his 13 years at Google (and almost two as its CEO), as he seeks to calm the muddy and sometimes ugly waters that Damore has churned up via his post titled ""Google's Ideological Echo Chamber.""
 The fateful meeting
 Pichai made the final decision about Damore's fate, after what several sources characterized as a tough debate by top management, with initial disagreement over how to handle the situation. It took place Monday in person and via phone after a weekend of trying to corral top staff, many of whom were on vacation, including Pichai.
According to those familiar with the discussion, his dozen direct reports whom he consulted were initially at odds about what to do about Google's continual and complex balancing act between free speech and fostering a safe workplace.
""Just like all of Google is struggling with this, we were not unanimous at first about whether what [Damore] wrote merited firing, although we all came around to it,"" said one top exec, ""But Sundar had to make a call about what kind of Google he wanted to stress and he did.""
Others in the meeting said it centered on how much latitude employees should have to express their opinions — one of the central tenets of Google since its founding — versus creating a culture that is trying to become attractive and safe to a broader range of people.
""I think the problem and also benefit of Google has been that we've created and encouraged an environment where everyone thinks they can say what they want, because that is what has always been the way it has been,"" said another top exec. ""But, at some point, if we really want to change, we have to think harder about what impact that has, especially when it makes women or others feel unsafe in the environment we have created.""
It's a split reflected at the very top of Google's owner, Alphabet, where its top lawyer, David Drummond, has been one of the most vocal advocates of free speech over the years. He was not part of Monday's decision-making meeting, as an Alphabet exec.
Meanwhile, another longtime Google leader, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, who was, penned her own essay that appeared in Fortune this week, with an opposite take:
""While people may have a right to express their beliefs in public, that does not mean companies cannot take action when women are subjected to comments that perpetuate negative stereotypes about them based on their gender. Every day, companies take action against employees who make unlawful statements about co-workers, or create hostile work environments.""
It's all against a backdrop of a company that — contrary to Damore's contention that he had been ""shamed"" into silence — has allowed its employees an unusual amount of latitude to air their opinions on a myriad of online platforms and in offline gatherings on everything from the quality of the food at its many free cafeterias to the political stances of the company.
(Sorry, young James: But, IMHO over nearly two decades of covering the company, Google workers never seem to shut up about anything. In fact, I seen low-level engineers insult its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, at public events with the pair insulting right back. My takeaway: Good lord, they all talk too much for techies.)
And talk I am certain they will do today, with Pichai facing a buzzsaw of differing opinion about that on both sides of an ever-complex debate about gender and diversity.
Some inside Google think it took too long for bosses there to react to what they consider a fatuous screed; while others disagree with their decision to eject Damore from the company altogether for speaking his mind.
And some want the company to do even more to fix persistent statistics that show around 80 percent of its technical staff is male that might have led to such musings; even as others think Google's diversity programs to help improve the numbers are deeply flawed and even discriminatory toward men.
 How the flap unfolded
 For those not paying attention, Damore posted a 10-page, 3,000 word thesis in which he began simply enough:
""I value diversity and inclusion, am not denying that sexism exists, and don't endorse using stereotypes. When addressing the gap in representation in the population, we need to look at population level differences in distributions. If we can't have an honest discussion about this, then we can never truly solve the problem.""
But then, in what is pretty much the main premise, Damore went on in detail: ""I'm simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don't see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.""
What followed was a list of those differences, including a claim that women were more social and artistic and could not take the stress of high-pressure jobs. Hence, ""neuroticism,"" or higher anxiety and lower stress tolerance, which he claimed was backed up by studies.
Perhaps most disingenuously, Damore also claimed that he had no voice, even after penning a long memo that he was able to send companywide and also was read by millions more.
In fact, Damore posted the essay earlier in one of Google's smaller discussion platforms — not one like its massive ""eng-misc"" one — before it finally bubbled up this past weekend and was finally noticed by top execs.
Alerted to it, sources said Pichai then started off gathering opinions from his direct reports — such as Wojcicki, HR head Eileen Naughton, top lawyer Kent Walker, cloud leader Diane Greene, communications head Jessica Powell and business head Philipp Schindler. Not all were physically present at Google's Silicon Valley HQ, where the group debated the issue, and were at first split.
""It was a cordial discussion, considering the topic, and you could see how you could argue both sides on the face of it,"" said one source. ""But I think Damore's focus on biology really made it clear that he had crossed the line.""
What turned the tide, said sources, was when it was noted that if Damore's dubious contentions about women's skills were replaced by those about race or religion, there would be no debate.
In fact, Wojcicki said has much in her essay:
""For instance, what if we replaced the word 'women' in the memo with another group? What if the memo said that biological differences amongst Black, Hispanic, or LGBTQ employees explained their underrepresentation in tech and leadership roles? Would some people still be discussing the merit of the memo's arguments or would there be a universal call for swift action against its author? I don't ask this to compare one group to another, but rather to point out that the language of discrimination can take many different forms and none are acceptable or productive.""
Damore has insisted he was ""smeared"" by top execs after the post went viral. ""There was a concerted effort among upper management to have a very clear signal that what I did was harmful and wrong and didn't stand for Google,"" Damore said in an interview with  Bloomberg. ""It would be career suicide for any executives or directors to support me.""
Numerous Google execs and employees I spoke to scoff at that notion, who gave his first interviews to an alt-right site, which has lessened support of him inside Google. Said one flatly: ""He cannot spew his dubious biology arguments — you can find any study to justify any crazy notion — and not pay a price for it.""
Pichai wrote to employees on Monday and said as much, but much more politely: ""To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.""
In other words, the CEO of Google has spoken. And now, Googlers will get their chance.

Sundar Pichai
 Google CEO Sundar Pichai faces an all-hands meeting on Thursday afternoon that could come to define his leadership of the Alphabet unit.
 Two years into his tenure in the top post and after 13 years of service at Google, Pichai must calm and unite a workforce divided over the firing of former engineer James Damore.
Damore lost his job of 3 1/2 years after criticizing the company's diversity-building efforts in a memo that also contained sexist comments.
 Pichai made the decision to fire Damore even while crediting him with raising important issues.
Damore's memo is so radioactive that it reportedly even divided the ranks of top executives who report directly to Pichai.
The fact that Pichai has elevated the discussion to a company-wide forum -- and has cut short a planned vacation to lead the meeting -- indicates how seriously he takes the decision to fire one worker out of tens of thousands.
That's especially the case because the CEO has a lot on his plate that has nothing to do with the diversity of the company's workforce:
 Facebook, its fiercest rival in the online ad market, just unveiled an online video service to take on YouTube. Google's cloud computing unit, despite making strides, still trails rivals Amazon and Microsoft in an important growth market. In Canada, the company lost a lawsuit in a ruling that could have major global impact on how the company collects and maintains information about its users. In Europe, regulators have already levied a $2.7 billion fine on the company over business practices they ruled were anti-competitive. Along with EU political leaders, they're also threatening tougher laws to punish internet companies that violate the privacy of EU citizens -- or don't do enough to protect them from terrorist propaganda. 
 Given the company's agenda, Pichai could have used a vacation.
But he didn't get the one he was expecting.
All-hands meetings at the company are usually brutally frank, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in May.
Whether cutting short his time off -- along with that of other Google executives who were supposed to be on vacation this week -- turns out to be worth it will depend on how well he can unite the company's global workforce later today.

 });Once again I find myself shaking my head, amazed that in 2017 we still have to explain to men that women can actually be great engineers, mathematicians, physicists, chemists, presidents, CEOs, and the list goes on.
 Once again someone — in this particular case a young man, former Google engineer James Damore — felt like he could classify all women into a series of feminine traits that proved that they could not possibly be as good as men at developing products for Google.
Before I go much further, let's just state for the record the ""personality differences"" he claims make women not as good or as valuable to Google in engineering positions:
 ""Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas."" ""Women also generally have a stronger interest in people rather than things, relative to men (also interpreted as empathizing vs. systemizing)."" ""Extraversion expressed as gregariousness rather than assertiveness."" ""Also higher agreeableness,"" resulting in ""women generally having a harder time negotiating salary, asking for raises, speaking up and leading."" ""Neuroticism (higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance). This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs.""

 Kids start hearing it in the classroom in elementary school, and it never stops: ""Joey didn't mean to hurt you, he was just being a boy."" ""Suzy, I know you would rather chit chat with your friends, but we need to focus on math right now, even if it is hard for you.""
I don't doubt that Damore truly believes he supports diversity, and that he was only stating ""the truth"" that other people don't want to talk about. Researchers call this bias. In an article on PBS, Susan Fiske, a leading researcher on prejudice and stereotypes who teaches at Princeton University, spoke about the role bias played against Hillary Clinton, saying:
""Bias in general, whether it's directed at gender, race, or anything else, is more automatic than people think. And it's also more ambivalent than we realize. So that makes it harder to detect in ourselves.""

 Likely, Damore really truly thought his manifesto was a service to Google and to all employees. He probably really thinks that women are not (as an average) suited for many of the positions that Google is trying to hire them for. 
He is not unique in this thought process. There are countless examples of high-profile people (mostly men) who genuinely think the same thing. Think about Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital saying that he would hire more women, but he doesn't want to lower his standards.
We have even heard some of these ideas come from top women leaders, like Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg. Her book, ""Lean In,"" advises women on how to be successful. ""Lean in,"" she says. Just work harder, and remember to work within the corporate norms that exist today.
The advice she has for a woman negotiating salary? Embrace the feminine stereotype (regardless of whether it is your style or personality). In ""Lean In,"" Sandberg references research by Hannah Riley Bowles, a public-policy lecturer who studies gender and negotiation at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. In order to be successful in negotiations, Bowles advises women to ""come across as being nice, concerned about others and 'appropriately' female.""

 What's a girl to do? Even Sandberg wants us to suck it up and play the game. Her theory is that once we get enough women into leadership, then we can change the game. But I believe that all of us will be waiting for generations to come for equal pay and equal treatment in the workplace if we take this approach.
Because in playing the game, we let Damore, and people like him, be right. He sees women acting as if they have the personality traits he actually thinks we all have. And once a woman doesn't conform, well then she must be an outlier.
Think about all the criticism Hillary Clinton received because of personality ""traits"" that people couldn't wrap their heads around (i.e. they were not feminine enough). If she got mad and raised her voice, she was ""shrill."" If she played hardball, she was ""mean"" and ""cold.""
Research has shown that women who don't adhere to gender stereotypes, and don't behave the way the ""average woman"" is expected to behave, often face blowback. ""People don't like to have their expectations violated,"" said Judi McLean Parks, Ph.D., professor of organizational behavior at the Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis. 
""If you (as a woman) behave in a masculine manner, then in some way or another, I'm going to think less of you, find you less likable, and be less likely to hire you — all because you have violated the expectations of what a woman is supposed to be like.""
 Sheryl Sandberg speaks about overcoming grief and resilience at a Commonwealth Club event in San Francisco.
 So here we are in 2017. Still debating whether women have the ""ability"" due to their X chromosome to perform and bring the same value to a job like software developer or company leader.
Clearly we have a very big problem in America where the idea persists that women aren't built to succeed at certain jobs (and coincidentally most of those jobs pay more and have more power).
We still see girls shying away from math and science in middle school and high school. We still see company after company in Silicon Valley submit women to terribly hostile environments. We still see women ""sucking it up,"" thinking they have to put up with this and just need to put their heads down and deal with it.
But I say no.
It's time for every single woman to denounce this line of thought. Push back. Be loud. Take our fair share now. Shout from the mountain tops to all the little girls. Rise up and support one another and make it known that we will not be marginalized because people think we can't be ""masculine"" enough.
We need more women to be whistleblowers like  Susan Fowler. As she tweets, ""The truth will always win."" 
 ""The truth will always win.""
 We need to get to a place where EVERY SINGLE WOMAN who's being mistreated says no. Where every single woman at Google lets Damore know just how much he has misjudged the opposite sex.
We cannot let this bias, and the culture that we have lived with for hundreds of years, remain so pervasive. We must act and speak up. We must teach men (and women too) that women can do just as much — just in different ways.
We don't have to be men to succeed, nor do we have to bow out because we are women.

 Did Google go too far with firing employee?   
 5:47  PM ET Wed,  9 Aug 2017 |  05:45 
 The Google employee who was fired by the tech giant earlier this week over a viral memo has said that the company's products have been hurt by a ""lack of ideological diversity"".
 James Damore, the 28-year-old former Google engineer who was sacked by the corporation for allegedly ""perpetuating gender stereotypes"", made the claim in his first televised interview with a news media outlet.
""I support diversity and inclusion, and I think that also our lack of ideological diversity has hurt our products,"" he told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday.
 Damore said that assumptions among ""left-leaning circles"" about conservative employees at Google had ""hurt"" his former employer in the interview. ""It makes us alienate large portions of the population,"" he claimed.
Mr Damore's firing triggered widespread debate on gender differences and efforts to make the technology sector more diverse. 
Women hold 26 percent of professional computing occupations in the U.S., and only 20 percent of Fortune 100 chief information officer positions being held by women in 2016, according to research by the National Center for Women and Information Technology.
Companies like Uber have been hit by allegations of pervasive discrimination and harassment against women.
In the wake of Damore's memo, more than 60 female employees are considering bringing class-action lawsuits against the company over alleged sexism and pay inequality, according to The Guardian.

 In Damore's memo, he wrote that: ""Women, on average, have more openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas. Women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than things, relative to men (also interpreted as empathizing vs. systemizing).""
He also argued that ""neuroticism (higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance)"" could be a factor in ""the lower number of women in high stress jobs.""
Danielle Browne, Google's vice president of diversity, wrote a memo in response, alleging the document ""advanced incorrect assumptions about gender"" and that ""it's not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes or encourages.""
Damore defended himself over the backlash against his memo, claiming that there was consensus among psychologists that biological differences accounted for different ""personality traits"" between men and women.
""I'm not saying that all men are different than all women, just that there's a distribution of these personality traits, and that distribution differs between men and women. So, there a lot of capable men and women at Google and I'm not trying to say that any of them are any worse than an average male engineer at Google.""
Damore's interview with Bloomberg marked his first televised appearance on a ""mainstream media"" news outlet. He had previously spoken with right-wing YouTube personalities.
 Damore felt 'betrayed' 
 ""I'm definitely hurt, I love Google and I've always been a fan of Google even before I joined, and so it really feels like they betrayed me in some way,"" Damore said in the interview.
""Because the whole point of my memo was actually to improve Google, and improve Google's culture. And they just punished me and shamed me for doing it.""
Damore has since faced both scathing criticism and praise since his sacking.

Pichai explained that the decision to fire the engineer related to ""portions of the memo (that) violate our Code of Conduct and cross the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.""
Damore said he is planning to pursue legal action, but hasn't yet mentioned what this would entail.

 Analyst caught in hot mic moment on Snap earnings call   
 9:54  AM ET Fri, 11 Aug 2017 |  00:53 
 Disappearing photos are not the only snaps coming from Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel. 
 Wall Street analysts pressed for more details on Snap's push notification policy and got a snappy response from the Snap CEO during Thursday night's earnings conference call. The conversation was not helped by an inadvertently unmuted phone line where an analyst seemed incredulous at Spiegel's response.

Evan Spiegel, co-founder and CEO of Snapchat
 Here's the exchange: 
 Rich Greenfield, analyst at BTIG:  ""I've got two questions for Evan. Evan, on your first investor call and actually Imran [Khan, Snap chief strategy officer] just mentioned it earlier as well, you have both spoken about how others use growth hacking to inflate [daily active users] and how it really hurts .... the platform's relationship with users. Yet we definitely, over the past quarter, begun to see push notifications from Snapchat, essentially alerting us to: 'One of our friends or one of our connections has published a story, would you like to go see it?' Wondering despite Imran's comment earlier, has your philosophy on growth begun to change? And then two, time spent on Snapchat and Instagram based on the recent comments from Instagram seems like it's fairly similar. But there's a very — my sense is there's very little direct messaging that happens on Instagram, implying that most of their time spent is actually content consumption. When you think about Snapchat's 30 minutes of usage per day, how much of that is actually Stories, including Discover, versus basically communications? Thanks."" Spiegel:  ""Yeah. So on the first question; we've been sending notifications like that for Stories for friends since 2014, so I'm not sure why you're just seeing that now. On the 'time spent' stuff, I think time spent is definitely interesting metric because unlike daily active[users], time spent is zero sum. So for us, in Q2, we saw over 40 minutes spent per day for users under 25, and over 20 minutes per day for users over 25. So I think that's some strong growth for us on the time spent side. We don't break out Stories versus communication, but I think the important thing is we've done a very good job innovating around monetizing communication. I think historically, that's been challenging for folks. So, you know, we're really excited about the way we've monetized communication with our creative tools."" Greenfield: ""So maybe just to be clear: What exactly is the 'growth hacking' that others do? If you sending push notifications is not 'growth hacking,' what are others doing that you consider to be growth hacking and not real DAU growth?"" Spiegel:  ""Yeah, so I think there are plenty of examples online [laughs] if you want to go for a Google. But I think the most important thing for us is that when we're telling you about content on a service that is really highly relevant to you and from your very close friends. And I think people, as they become more reliant on push notifications to sort of relax the standards there, and I think it's important for our business."" Greenfield: ""Thank you."" Operator: ""Our next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC ..."" Brandon Ross, BTIG analyst (loudly on hot mic):  ""I didn't even understand his response!"" 
 Source: FactSet and CNBC recording from Snap investor relations 
The conversation came after Snap's quarterly results fell short of analyst expectations, with revenue and user growth disappointing for the second consecutive quarter. The newly public social media company has faced aggressive tit-for-tat competition with the likes of Facebook and Alphabet's Google, which are moving into Snap's territory of ephemeral messaging and augmented reality, and short, instant media clips, respectively. 
Shares of Snap were under pressure during the call, dropping double digits.
While the exchange was certainly one of the more heated during the quarterly call, there were several instances where analysts asked for more guidance on new products like Snap Maps or advertising tools, only to be met with vague responses that it was still ""early days."" 
The disconnect between Snap and Wall Street made it into Friday's analyst coverage.
""Snap's unwillingness to provide Street guidance will continue to be a disservice to shareholders as estimates continue to fluctuate wildly and it introduces unneeded uncertainty into results,"" Jefferies analyst Brian Fitzgerald wrote in a note.
The disjunction between Snap and Wall Street comes in spite of Snap's so-called secret weapon, Khan, a former star analyst and investment banker. The finance veteran helped lead Alibaba's massive IPO — subject to its own skepticism from investors at the time— and was one of the first analysts to become an authoritative commentator on internet media businesses like Facebook.
Snap, like many competitive tech start-ups, has been secretive about its products and operations. But some commentators perceived Spiegel's response as arrogant. 
 Tweet: Definitely the best thing for CEOs to do when shares are falling 17% is to sound annoyed that people don't ""understand"" his company.
 Tweet: Same arrogant approach to IR out of $SNAP as last Q. No commentary in the letter, and prob no media calls either.
 Snap didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Greenfield said in response to a request for comment from CNBC that ""The hot mic comment was certainly not intended to be heard on the call as they had already introduced next company. 
""However, based on investor feedback, it is abundantly clear that nobody understands what is and is not growth hacking as it relates to push notifications that have a direct impact on driving daily active users. Evan Spiegel labeling other's actions 'growth hacking' distinct from what Snapchat is doing needs to be clarified and is a critical issue for investors.""
After the call BTIG analysts tweeted out a light-hearted response using Snap's Bitmoji technology:

Sundar Pichai
 This was not the week off that Silicon Valley had planned.
 Google CEO Sundar Pichai now leads a workforce divided by the issue of diversity, according to an email he sent to employees cancelling an all-hands meeting on the topic.
""The vast majority of you are very supportive of our decision. A smaller percentage of you wish we would do more. And some are worried that you cannot speak out at work freely,"" Pichai wrote.
 Even that spin sounds optimistic in light of a report that said just over half the company's employees who responded to a survey on an online message board disagreed with Pichai's decision to fire engineer James Damore.
Damore wrote a controversial memo that began with criticism of the company's diversity programs but then veered into sexist remarks that prompted Pichai to send him packing after 3 1/2 years of service.
Pichai cancelled his vacation to call an all-hands meeting to discuss the firing, then cancelled the meeting over concerns that some Google employees, who'd been publicly identified by conservative commentators online, would be abused.
In other words, Pichai retreated -- often not an effective long-term strategy to counter aggression. Some on the right are now calling for ""marches"" on the company's offices.
And he's far from the only technology industry leader facing a fierce attack.
Two other surprising moves by tech power brokers this week point to an industry that is increasingly at war with itself, as well as external forces.

 The first were comments made by venture capitalist Roger McNamee, to CNBC and others, that he regretted being among the early investors in both Google and Facebook, which in his view have become addictive threats to society.
Days later, one of the best-known venture firms in the world, which has made tens of billions dollars investing in young tech firms, sued someone who until recently had run of their most-successful startups.
The lawsuit filed against Uber founder, former CEO and board member Travis Kalanick by Benchmark is arguably unprecedented, as far as pivots go.
Filed by VCs who were among his earliest backers and staunchest defenders through management crises under his leadership, it accuses Kalanick of fraud.
Specifically, it charges that he made fraudulent statements last summer, when he engineered three additional seats be added to the company's board -- one of which he still holds.
""Kalanick intentionally concealed and failed to disclose his gross mismanagement and other misconduct,"" says the suit.
Ouch.
Given that Benchmark owns 13 percent of Uber and Kalanick 10 percent, respectively -- stakes worth many billions of dollars based on the company's valuation -- it's a suit that could make many attorneys very rich.
All of this antagonism comes as the profile of the technology industry has grown commensurate with size and market value of its marquee companies.
As of midday trading Friday, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon were worth a combined $2.96 trillion (with a ""t"".)
That kind of size tends to draw attention.
Facebook late last year was blamed for no less than handing the election to President Donald Trump, an accusation so large that it's since sent Mark Zuckerberg around the U.S. to find out what really happened.
One thing that has happened, as events this week have shown, is that this largely west coast-based industry, which once prided itself on remaining aloof from the rest of America -- and disengaged from Washington politics -- now finds itself part of a nation often at war with itself.
""America is an experiment,"" Defense Secretary James Mattis said this week.
Mattis made the comments alongside others predicting a greater role in America's defense for companies like Amazon and Google.
Their leaders may want to be careful what they wish for.
As many in Silicon Valley begin to pack their most outlandish clothes into their futuristic vehicles and head to the bohemian survivalist escape into the Nevada desert known as Burning Man, they should know one thing.
America will be waiting for them when they get back.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai takes the stage during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016.
 The Google engineer fired for writing a controversial memo about diversity has gone beyond referring to the company as an ""echo chamber"" that won't stand for dissent and now says it's ""almost like a cult.""
In an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, James Damore gave his explanation for why he was fired, taking a shot at the company's culture and its famous motto.
 ""For many, including myself,"" he wrote, ""working at Google is a major part of their identity, almost like a cult with its own leaders and saints, all believed to righteously uphold the sacred motto of 'Don't be evil.'""
Damore was fired at the start of this week after 3 1/2 years as an engineer for a post he wrote, laying out his view that men are biologically more well-suited than women for many tech jobs.
He's not apologizing.

Damore wrote in the op-ed that he ""committed heresy against the Google creed by stating that not all disparities between men and women that we see in the world are the result of discriminatory treatment.""
Damore said that when he tried to engage in ""reasoned discussion"" with his peers on the issue, ""mostly I was ignored.""
While his cause has lit up the conservative blogosphere, Damore chose to quote famous leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky.
""As Noam Chomsky once observed, 'the smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum,'"" Damore wrote.

 Google is honoring the birth of hip hop with a doodle that puts you in the DJ booth   
 7:25  AM ET Fri, 11 Aug 2017 |  01:07 
 The search engine giant Google has unveiled a new doodle on its home page commemorating the birth of hip hop 44 years ago.
 By clicking on today's Google doodle you are transported to an interactive player that allows you to choose records, fade between them, choose the pace of the beat and even scratch.
For the celebration animation, Google has teamed up with visual artist and rapper Fab 5 Freddy.
 Tweet 1
 The story goes that Jamaican-born DJ Kool Herc was the first to extend the break beat of a song by using two records, which in turn allowed dancers to move for longer and MC's to rap over the music.
The first example of this, according to Fab 5 Freddy, was at a party in the South Bronx in New York City in 1973.
 Hip Hop riches
 The art form has moved on from the early days and a lucky few have made an extremely rewarding career.
In a piece that trended on LinkedIn last year TV host Paul Carrick Brunson predicted that Sean 'Puffy' Coombs would become the first hip hop billionaire in 2017.
Forbes currently calculates Coombs' worth to be about $750 million from his investments in drinks companies and fashion as well as music.
Another rap mogul that could tip over into billionaire status is Andre Romelle Young, better known by his stage name Dr. Dre.
The rapper, record producer, and entrepreneur is the founder and current CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and Beats Electronics.
Beats Electronics is a headphone and speaker company acquired by Apple in 2014 for $3 billion.

U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis
 Defense Secretary James Mattis says he sees a growing role for the technology industry in defending the United States.
 The comments suggest a potential untapped market for Amazon and Google, whose hometowns Mattis visited this week on a West Coast swing, and other large companies like Apple, Facebook and Microsoft.
Like the leaders of these tech companies, Mattis is focused on acquiring more expertise in artificial intelligence.
 The difference is his goal: getting it into the U.S. military faster, to make it a ""more lethal and more effective"" fighting force.
""Many of the advances [in AI] are out here in private companies,"" Mattis told reporters after touring the Mountain View, California, location of the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental.
What Mattis referred to as ""the DIUX"" is a new arm of the Defense Department designed to speed the adoption of new technologies into the military.
Already the unit, whose advisors include Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt, has reportedly had its software deployed in the Middle East for use in on-the-fly targeting of weapons systems, according to a report.
""We'll get better at integrating AI advances out here into the U.S. military,"" thanks to the unit. Mattis said DIUX will ""grow in influence and impact"" on the Pentagon.
Schmidt and Raj Shah, the DIUX chief since May 2016, visited Al Udeid, a U.S. military base in Qatar, where the unit's software was installed.
The DIUX unit located near Google will have a staff of 75 by next summer, up from the current 48, according to a presentation given in advance of Mattis' question and answer session.
During his meeting with reporters, Mattis also said the U.S. military was ""ready"" to respond to the threat from North Korea.

 });Like other biases, sexism and racism are often spread with the use of insidious coded language, inappropriate appeals to freedom of speech and harmful pseudoscientific data promoting biological difference as ""inferiority.""
 For example, as a Latina in Silicon Valley, I've noticed that women and minorities promoted to leadership roles are often characterized as ""unqualified."" It grates on me, because it's a word rarely used to describe male leaders, even those fired for lack of performance. Funny,  because studies show men, on average, apply for jobs when they meet 60 percent of the qualifications, where women don't apply until they've met 100 percent of them.
Perhaps it's this fatigue with unfair generalizations that elevated Silicon Valley's latest gender war to new heights following publication of an internal memo from a Google engineer asserting that women are ill-suited for technical jobs for biological reasons.  (Read 10 of the most shocking quotes from the memo.)
 The incident underscores a problem that's endemic at Google and much of the tech world — not only do tech companies often fail to create a diverse workplace, but they have a culture where employees feel empowered to claim that efforts to strike a balance put them under duress.
To be fair, the primary purpose of the memo was to condemn Google's purported ""ideological echo chamber"" and alleged ""discrimination to reach equal representation of women in tech and leadership."" A number of supporters have come forward. The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board, for example, suggested that the employee may have been fired for ""advancing harmful gender stereotypes"" or expressing views that are antithetical to Google's political culture, which the Journal characterized as ""left wing.""
 var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];
 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 While the WSJ acknowledged expressions of gender stereotypes may rise to unlawful sexual harassment (especially in the context of an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor into Google's treatment of women employees), I believe firing an employee for expressing antithetical views to his employer, if true, would be permissible grounds for termination by most private employers.
The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution applies to government interference with individuals' free speech rights. Nearly all tech employees are at-will employees who may be terminated with or without cause for any lawful reason. Private-sector employees do not enjoy constitutionally protected rights of free speech or privacy or freedom from search of tools such as work-issued computers and telephones.
 ""The incident underscores a problem that's endemic at Google and much of the tech world…they have a culture where employees feel empowered to claim that efforts to strike a balance put them under duress.""
 Nonetheless, in a note to employees, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai, asserted that ""we strongly support the right of Googlers to express themselves, and much of what was in that memo is fair to debate…People must feel free to express dissent."" He also suggested that employees ""need to find a way to debate issues on which we might disagree—while doing so in line with our Code of Conduct.""
Pichai explained the memo crossed the line by suggesting ""a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to [technical] work is contrary to Google's basic values and to the Code Conduct"".
Google was right to fire the employee who authored the memo because his rhetoric undermines the company's stated values. In a creative team work environment, it's counter-productive to retain employees that espouse on-the-job negative biases about the women with whom they collaborate.
However, the premise of the memo was that Google's inclusion initiatives were reverse discrimination, when by objective diversity standards, the company, as it admits on its website: ""is miles from where we want to be.""
The numbers are stark: At Google, 69 percent of workers are men, 31 percent are women. Among key positions, only 20 percent of engineering jobs and 25 percent of managers are women. Racial diversity is lacking too: the workforce is 56 percent white, 35 percent Asian, 4 percent Hispanic, 2 percent blacks, and those of two races or more are 4 percent of staff. The company also faces a Labor Department investigation for allegedly paying women less than men.
The memo's author claims to value diversity and inclusion. Yet, most of his assertions allege purported biological differences between men and women, which he states are ""universal across human cultures."" These statements are allegedly supported by evolutionary psychology, a field that has many detractors because of its alleged sexism, much as racial biology is no longer considered ""scientific"" by most biologists.
It is this attempt at pop biology that is the most incendiary aspect of this misguided memo especially for those who recall the use of biology to claim the inferiority of African-Americans. The author condemns 95 percent of social science because of bias but the science he believes in appears to be immune from similar criticism.
This whole blowup at Google underscores that tech companies are not diverse workplaces and efforts to foster diversity lead to conflict that, poorly handled, leads to backlash.
The memo goes at the heart of what Pichai says on the firm's diversity site: ""A diverse mix of voices leads to better discussions, decisions, and outcomes."" He's right. And it also boosts profits.  Research from McKinsey & Company finds firms in the top quartile for racial diversity are 35 percent likelier to have better financial results. And firms in the top quartile for gender diversity are 15 percent likelier to have stronger performance compared to average companies.
Companies must find ways to help employees realize that diversity means we come from different reference points and building shared understandings in the face of potential conflict is not easy. It is facilitated by respectful discourse about all people. It means educating oneself about what constitutes discrimination, one's civil rights at work, and being willing to work with people with different beliefs and backgrounds from our own.
That doesn't have to be politically correct. Indeed, to build effective teams, companies must embrace a variety of different views, including from those who acutely feel the loss of privilege as the culture and composition of a company changes. But they must also protect the ability of all employees to do their jobs, earn a livelihood and get paid fairly, notwithstanding colleagues' hostile views.

 });When 24-year-old Google software engineer Amelia Brunner read the now viral anti-diversity memo by James Damore, she was ""painfully unsurprised.""
 Titled ""Google's Ideological Echo Chamber,"" the document asserts that there are ""differences in distributions of traits between men and women,"" which ""may in part explain why we don't have 50 percent representation of women in tech and leadership.""
Many people in the industry ""don't themselves see the ways that unconscious bias affects minorities in the workplace,"" Brunner, who has been at the company for two years, tells CNBC Make It. ""They don't think it happens and then they interpret the concerns raised by affected parties as manipulative cries for attention.""
 On her team at Google, Brunner says that none of her direct bosses are women and there has been little said among her coworkers concerning the memo. The reason: They aren't phased by it, she says. ""It sucks because I hate to say that it's standard,"" she says, ""but it is standard.""
Although Brunner admits that she was not shocked by the contents of the memo, one thing did catch her by surprise: the public outcry.
 var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];
 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 ""Despite the fact that women in tech speak out loudly and often on these topics,"" says Brunner, ""people both in and outside of the industry still don't listen, or still write these concerns off as attention-seeking or melodramatic.""
""I hope it provides a concrete example of the type of attitudes that women in tech have to interact with on a daily basis to legitimize what we have been saying for years,"" she says.

 Brunner explains that male engineers often ignore the female engineers' competency and assume they were ""diversity hires,"" or employed to boost the percentage of women at the company.
Google responded to the memo, which was first circulated internally, shortly after it was published. Once the document became public, the company fired the engineer who wrote it and sent a company-wide email, which CEO Sundar Pichai posted on Google's blog.
In the post, Pichai writes: ""To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.""
The company was scheduled to hold an all-hands meeting for employees on Thursday to discuss the memo. It was canceled, however, over concerns for employees' safety after some were threatened online.
Brunner applauds Google's efforts to create a diverse workplace and says that Google has held town halls in the past to discuss these issues. However, she notes there's a stark difference between diversity and inclusion.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai
 ""You can have diversity in terms of numbers,"" says Brunner, ""but that's different from inclusion and how well you're incorporating minorities into the company."" 
""A company that's really inclusive and that really values diversity will not block minorities from moving up,"" she says.
In her time in the tech industry, she says one thing has been obvious: the lack of women in leadership roles.
Tech companies have been slow to hire women and minorities for senior-level positions. In fact, women hold just 14.1 percent of executive positions at Silicon Valley companies,  according to a report from the law firm Fenwick & West.
Google's most recent annual  diversity report illustrates that about a third of the staff is Asian and only 2 percent are African-American. Women comprise 31 percent of total employees and hold just 20 percent of tech positions and 25 percent of leadership roles.
Despite these glaring figures, Brunner says many companies simply don't care. ""Even when statistics are released that definitively show that there is a diversity issue, especially in leadership roles, they blame anything and everything but themselves or the culture that they foster,"" she says. ""So when I read this memo, I thought, 'typical.'""
The lack of female leaders in the tech industry pushed her to become involved with mentorship programs for younger women entering tech. ""I want to give to others what I feel that I never had,"" says Brunner. ""I look back and think about how much drastically easier navigating the industry would have been if I had.""
 Lauren Thomas | CNBC 
Moderator Laura Sydell, from NPR; Sara Clemens, COO at Pandora; Emily White, former COO at Snapchat; and Minnie Ingersoll, co-founder of Shift, speak on a panel for women in tech in San Francisco on Tuesday night.
 At Columbia, where she majored in computer science, Brunner noticed that women stopped pursuing courses in the field as the classes became more advanced. She served as a teaching assistant for two higher-level courses so that her peers would see a woman in a leadership role.
The software engineer fell in love with the tech world after taking a Java class on a whim. Within a few weeks of taking the class, ""it just clicked"" for her.
""I had never engaged with a subject that made so much intuitive sense to me,"" says Brunner. ""It was compelling, fun, exciting, and I couldn't get enough of it.""
She snagged a coveted internship at Time Warner and then at Apple while still in undergrad, before eventually scoring her job at Google.
 ""We need to reflect and critically look at our beliefs in facing these micro-aggressions.""
-Amelia Brunner, Google software engineer
 After graduating in 2015, she became a teacher for Girls Who Code, a non-profit dedicated to getting young girls interested in science and tech. Brunner says the experience was rewarding: ""Even something as simple as 'Oh, this is a person who I feel similar to who is successful in this work environment' can make a huge difference in making younger women feel confident in their professional identities,"" she says.
Now, she's a member of Google's groups aimed at female employees.
As a millennial in tech, she feels responsible for helping to change the attitude towards underrepresented groups going forward. And that, she says, begins with individual employees: ""We need to reflect and critically look at our beliefs in facing these micro-aggressions,"" says Brunner. ""Until that level of depth happens, there won't be change.""

 Fired Google engineer James Damore: I was pointing out problems at Google   
 5:09  PM ET Mon, 14 Aug 2017 |  11:01 
 James Damore, the former Google engineer fired over a memo criticizing the company's diversity efforts, says his former employer is discriminating in its hiring practices based on race or gender.
 Damore, whose online post has divided Google and ignited a national firestorm, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" that Google is ""treating people differently based on race or gender.""
The company ""is pressing individual managers to increase diversity"" and is ""using race or gender"" to decide which workers are promoted and which teams job candidates are placed on, Damore said.
 He also said he is ""pursuing legal remedies"" against the company over his firing.
Google, through a spokesperson, declined comment.
Damore was fired last week after 3 1/2 years as an engineer over a post he wrote arguing that among the reasons there are so few women in technology were gender-based preferences and characteristics.
He wrote the memo after attending what he called ""a private diversity summit"" at the company.
Damore said he ""was very surprised"" at his firing because he ""was just trying to help"" the company fix what he felt was a problem.
Google's management, however, said the memo promoted harmful gender stereotypes and violated its code of conduct.
Damore said it was ""hard to regret"" sending the memo, because he hopes some good comes out of it. But he said ""I wouldn't have used the term 'neuroticism'"" to describe female engineers.
In his 10-page memo, written a month ago, Damore called Alphabet unit Google an ""echo chamber.""
Yet by the end of last week, in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, he said the company was ""almost like a cult.""
Still, his criticism of his former employer was somewhat muted. ""I support Google...I don't support anyone who wants to hurt Google,"" Damore told CNBC, adding that he doesn't support anyone calling for marches on the company.

 Google is paying Apple billions per year to remain on the iPhone   
 1:13  PM ET Mon, 14 Aug 2017 |  00:48 
 Google is paying Apple billions of dollars to remain the default search engine on iPhones and iPads, Bernstein said in a note to investors on Monday.
The firm believes that Google will pay Apple about $3 billion this year, up from $1 billion just three years ago, and that Google's licensing fees make up a large bulk of Apple's services business.
 Apple has been touting its services business as a quickly growing segment of the company, noting that it expects that branch alone will soon be as large as a Fortune 500 company.
""Court documents indicate that Google paid Apple $1B in 2014, and we estimate that total Google payments to Apple in FY 17 may approach $3B,"" Bernstein analyst A.M. Sacconaghi Jr. said. ""Given that Google payments are nearly all profit for Apple, Google alone may account for 5% of Apple's total operating profits this year, and may account for 25% of total company OP growth over the last two years.""
Bernstein sees pros and cons in the payments. 
Sacconaghi said that Google might decide to back away from paying Apple any licensing fees if it feels confident enough that its search engine is so popular Apple won't include any other option by default. 
On the other hand, Sacconaghi said that Apple's iOS devices contribute about 50 percent to Google's mobile search revenue, which means Google might be too afraid to walk away from its licensing deal with Apple. In this case, it's a win-win for Apple and Google.
Bernstein has an outperform rating on Apple with a price target of $175.

 });When Falon Fatemi would come across a particularly tricky homework problem for her computer engineering class at Santa Clara University, she would take her books to her day job — at Google — and ask for help from the engineers there. 
 As a 19-year-old in 2005, Fatemi was working on Google's strategy for global expansion during the day and completing her degree in the mornings and at night, she tells CNBC Make It. What was supposed to have been an internship had quickly turned into a full-time role, she says. She worked there for six years.
""At that age, you know you don't need that much sleep,"" she laughs.
 Today, Fatemi is the CEO and founder of Node, an AI data analysis start-up that has raised $16.3 million, with backing from investors like Mark Cuban. But she still values the lessons she learned at Google.
Here are five things the experience taught her about creating success at work and in business.

 Node
Node CEO Falon Fatemi in 2005 at Google
 1. Be disciplined
 Scoring a position at Google had a lot to do with her parents' influence, says Fatemi. They came to the U.S. from Iran during the revolution there in the 1970's, and their immigrant mentality emphasized education and working hard, she says.
Her mom and dad had two rules: Fatemi and her brother had to study a year ahead every summer in math and science, and she had to have a summer job that furthered her future career.
""So while my friends were like babysitting or life guarding, I was actually doing patent research for lawyers at a firm,"" she tells CNBC Make It. ""So I always had sort of a strong sense of discipline.""
 2. Make connections
 At Google, Fatemi's network included influential women like Stacy Brown-Philpot (now CEO of Task Rabbit) and Kim Jabal (current CFO at Weebly), and she was even in the occasional meeting with Sheryl Sandberg (COO at Facebook).
But connections were also how she got to Google in the first place.
As part of an entrepreneurship class Fatemi was taking at school, she had the opportunity to work on a research project for Microsoft. Through that project, a colleague recommended her to a senior employee at Google.
""Through that recommendation, I got basically a meeting,"" she says.
""The big take away from that experience is that at the end of the day, really, through people these opportunities happen."" 
 3. Take action and ask for what you want
 Once she had her foot in the door at Google, Fatemi made the most of it.
During the interview, she was asked what she was interested in. So Fatemi decided to say what she really wanted: to ""learn everything"" and to work at Google. She got the offer. 
""I had the courage to be like 'I want this job and I want to learn as much as I can,'"" she says. ""I took action. I chose to do that [Microsoft] research project, and I chose to ask for the job that I wanted.""
 4. Be scrappy
 One of Fatemi's early tasks at Google was to come up with an entrance strategy for Africa and Eastern Europe.
""Imagine being asked that when you are 19,"" Fatemi says. ""The way that Google works is you just have to figure it out. It is like sink or swim. And so I did.""
With just a few weeks to create the analysis, she researched the problem and then found experts within the organization to give her input. The important part, she says, is learning enough about the problem to ask the right questions.
""You can short cut a lot of your time by starting with setting up meetings with the right people, and making sure you are prepared for those meetings,"" she says. 
""You've got to be scrappy!"" she adds.
 5. Dream big
 Now 31, Fatemi is the CEO of her own company. 
And, according to Node's website, Fatemi is hiring. It remains to be seen if any 19-year-olds will apply and make the cut, but Fatemi says she would consider making a young hire in the future.
""At the end of the day, you are the only one that is limiting your ability to dream, or to actually execute on your dreams,"" she says. ""Don't let yourself get in the way of that.""

 Many slides from the diversity training decks use real-world examples to explain how conversations can be unintentionally biased. One slide, for instance, suggests that an employee who tells another, ""The interface needs to be so simple your mother can use it,"" is guilty of ""stereotype bias.""
 Other slides, however, may explain why Damore thought Google ""has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence."" 
For instance, in a slide titled ""Off-topic for this session,"" the first point underneath that heading reads: ""Debating whether bias exists at your organization.""
 That suggests any argument that Google is not biased is unwelcome at the diversity sessions, which are voluntary.
Another slide titled, ""Create a safe learning space,"" includes this instruction: ""Don't repeat what people said in this room.""
 The presentations are called ""Google's Bias Busting @ Work Facilitator Guide,"" which is available online here and ""Bias Busting @ Work Slides,"" seen here.
A Google spokesperson said, ""Far from being secretive, these are documents we've intentionally made publicly available to the world for years, for discussion and feedback. And the context of these bias-busting sessions is important: to make these sessions productive, we ask participants to focus on their own experiences with bias, and not to disclose others' personal experiences. That's a common sense way of running an effective workshop. There are numerous other forums where employees are able to discuss our programs.""
Damore's memo sparked widespread criticism for including stereotypes that women are inherently more cooperative and less interested in status, and implying that they are less suited for coding jobs because of these traits, among other things. Critics have suggested that Damore's assertions lacked scientific backing and were selectively chosen to bolster a conclusion he'd already reached, among other criticisms.
The controversy has come as Google, a unit of Alphabet, faces a U.S. government lawsuit that accuses the company of paying women far less than men in similar roles. In January, the U.S. Department of Labor sued Google to obtain employee data as part of an inquiry into alleged salary discrimination by gender.
Google has refuted the allegation and says it has a gender blind approach to compensation. 
Two months ago, Google hired Danielle Mastrangel Brown as vice president of diversity and inclusion and chief people officer, a position she previously held at Intel.
On a web page describing its diversity efforts, Google says it is seeking talent ""where we haven't looked before.""

 });Samsung, Google and Philips are working with a start-up called Puls to deliver Genius Bar-style repairs and tech demonstrations to customers at home.
 Founded in 2015, Puls started out as a mobile phone repair service called CellSavers. It focused on fixing common mobile device issues like spent batteries or cracked screens.
This week, the company changed its name to Puls to reflect broader ambitions, CEO and co-founder Eyal Ronen told CNBC.
 The company still sends technicians to a needy customer's door within an hour of booking or at another prescheduled time. But Puls technicians are now able to repair, demonstrate and install a wide variety of gadgets, including smartphones, tablets, smart light bulbs, televisions and smart devices like the Google Home or Nest thermostats and smoke alarms.
 CNBC tested the Puls service, and true to its promise, technicians arrived within one hour of ordering, even on a Sunday morning, to mount a flat screen TV on a wall and demonstrate a Google Home smart speaker.
The TV installation required two technicians for heavy lifting. Once they were on site, we also asked them to also repair a cracked iPhone 5 screen. With the parts and tools they had, they were able to complete all three tasks within 70 minutes. 
 Puls relies on freelancers instead of full-time technicians. Eyal said his company accepts only 8 percent of applicants, conducting extensive skills and background checks before assigning them to any job.
The technicians who responded to our call, Chance House and Marcus Friberg, both had experience working at brick-and-mortar retailers and repair shops prior to joining Puls. They told CNBC they like working through the company's app, rather than in a shop, for schedule flexibility and variety.
Puls provides ""on-boarding"" training for technicians, they said, but it's not mandatory. ""If you know how and want to just repair iPhones all day you can do that,"" House said. ""But if you want to get into more of this smart home stuff, as it gets more popular, you can learn that, too.""
 In-home demos are free for customers for now. Other repairs or installations cost $30 to $200. In the event where a customer doesn't buy a device after they've indulged in a demonstration, Puls still gets paid. But Eyal wouldn't comment on specific arrangements with partners such as Samsung and Google.
Puls faces a bevy of competitors when it comes to mobile device repairs, most notably Best Buy's Geek Squad business, and other start-ups like iCracked or UBreakiFix.
More recently, Amazon has begun to offer Smart Home Services, where it sends technicians to a user's home to see how well the Echo, and Alexa-enabled devices can work in their own homes. 
Ronen said his company's strength is in the convenience it can promise thanks to its own software. ""We made something we call a 'matchmaking mechanism,' that figures out in half-a-second which technician has the skills, availability, the right parts on hand and so on to get to you and help you this hour,"" he said.
Puls just raised a $25 million series B funding from Temasek-backed Red Dot Capital, Samsung NEXT, Sequoia Capital and other investors, bringing its total capital raised to $43 million. Puls plans to use its funding to expand beyond the 40 U.S. cities where it is operating today and to add new devices like smart security systems and the newest iPhones and Samsung Edge devices to its platform. 
An investor with Samsung's VC arm, Christina Bechhold Russ, told CNBC her company invested in Puls because its service is a net-positive for Samsung's customers and business.
""There are barriers to adoption for people when it comes to these new connected devices, or the smart home. It has to be frictionless, especially if you want to reach populations that aren't as comfortable using tech already,"" she said.

 Microsoft on Tuesday announced that it has acquired Cycle Computing, a 12-year-old company that specializes in running complex high-performance computing workloads across different public clouds. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
 The move could help Microsoft ensure that more of the supercomputing jobs companies want to do end up on its Azure public cloud, rather than other public clouds, such as the market-leading Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform. Currently Cycle Computing's CycleCloud Software helps companies run certain computing jobs on multiple clouds, and then provision more or less infrastructure as necessary.
""We will continue to support Cycle Computing clients using AWS and/or Google Cloud,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. ""While future Microsoft versions released will be Azure focused, we're committed to providing customers a seamless migration experience to Azure if and when they choose to migrate.""
 The deal comes three years after Microsoft bought high-performance computing company GreenButton. But last year AWS acquired another one of these companies called Nice.
JP Morgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, Pfizer and Western Digital are among the companies that have worked with Cycle Computing, which was founded in 2005. The company's tools will manage 1 billion core-hours of computing resources this year, Cycle Computing CEO Jason Stowe wrote in a blog post.
 ""Their technology will further enhance our support of Linux HPC workloads and make it easier to extend on-premise workloads to the cloud,"" Jason Zander, corporate vice president at Microsoft Azure, wrote in a blog post.

According to Blockchain co-founder and CEO Peter Smith, major changes in the way we live and work with technology could happen in the next 20 years.
 And Smith has sold his vision to some pretty legendary folks. His bitcoin wallet start-up, Blockchain, which allows users to store and transact with digital currencies, has heavy hitting investors including billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson and Google's investment arm, GV. 
Branson invited Smith to be part of his  Future Visions series, where he asks notable technologists and visionaries to predict what the future will look like.

 ""While we'll still eat food, go to work and travel on vacations, the ways in which we do these things will be drastically altered thanks to generation-defining changes in technology,"" says  Smith in his piece on Virgin's website.
""In fact, I predict that by 2037 a complete global computer fabric will make interacting with goods, services and people easier than ever. Citizens of the world will be more closely connected through technology, communication and networks.""
Recently, the digital currency Bitcoin has been surging in price and titans like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have been talking a lot about the future of artificial intelligence, but both Bitcoin and AI still remain remain largely the purview of the tech elite.
That will change, says Smith, who has a vested interest in the technological revolution.
But perhaps more interesting is the way Smith describes the transition to a world fully integrated with AI and digital currency.
 ""The thing about real transformation is that it happens little by little and then all at once.""
-Peter Smith, co-founder and CEO of Blockchain
 According to him, blockchain (the technology that enables cryptocurrencies, after which his company is named) and AI ""are gaining traction and broader acceptance by consumers globally. That said, the thing about real transformation is that it happens little by little and then all at once,"" Smith says. ""We're still in the little by little phase but I anticipate progress will compound in the coming decades and we'll see ubiquity of these technologies in 20 years' time.""
The onus is on both individuals and businesses to stay abreast of the technology.
""The rate of change is going to get increasingly faster and catching up will only get harder, so it's key for individuals and businesses to stay (or become) nimble and able to adapt to an ever changing environment,"" Smith says.
""It's vital that everyone becomes fluent in digital technologies. Your business may not be a technology company in the traditional sense, but it will need to use technology to compete in a global marketplace. Having a foundational understanding will be an integral part of your success.""
So what will all that change look like for consumers? Though Smith admits that it's impossible to know ""with any confidence what the future has in store,"" he does offer a handful of predictions that are pretty wild to consider: 
Appliances, like your refrigerator, will learn what you like
""Our businesses and homes will become highly automated and most of our appliances will be connected to the internet,"" says Smith, as part of the Internet of Things (IoT). ""There will be limitless customization fueled by AI and massive data platforms that will be able to anticipate customer needs and deliver goods and services instantly. Customers will be able to get what they want, when they want.""
If you go to a store, you won't leave with the product, it will be shipped to you
""Today, the majority of consumers prefer to purchase online or digitally, driving rapid growth in e-commerce and online shopping,"" writes Smith. ""This change is going to cause retail stores to be replaced by showroom type experiences where consumers can still have a tactile experience but inventory management and delivery will happen in the background.""
Most stores will no longer exist in real life
""It is not unlikely that stores will be replaced by [virtual reality] experiences,"" says Smith.
There will be no more gas pump attendants, sales clerks or employees checking in a consumer to a location or activity
""Everything will be automated,"" he says.
There will be no more cash
""Mass adoption of digital currencies that are affordable and flexible will make cash extinct, with the rare exception of a few remaining analogue cultural pockets.""

Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz shows the new Google Home during Google I/O 2016 at Shoreline Amphitheatre
 Google Home can now place phone calls.
 Google announced that the new feature is rolling out to owners of its Amazon Echo competitor now. Amazon's product also allows calls, but only to other Echos. With the Google Home, you can call any number in the U.S. or Canada for free.
You'll need to activate the feature from a phone with the Google Home app installed. For now, it'll only display ""unknown caller"" when you call someone else, which could be problematic for folks who don't answer strange numbers. People who subscribe to Google Fi can have their name appear, and Google says the feature will eventually be available for all phone numbers.
 Also, you can only dial contacts stored in your Google Contacts account, or businesses, which means you might not be able to call everyone in your iPhone phonebook (yet.)
Still, most folks should be able to say ""OK Google, call mom,"" or ""OK Google, call John's Pizza shop,"" as soon as the feature hits. It's rolling out in stages so check for it now and over the coming days.

 });In the wake of the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally, which left an activist dead and many injured, some leading tech companies are taking a stand against extremist views.
 Last week Friday, right-wing blogger Jason Kessler organized a rally to protest Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a city park.
The rally ended in violence as supporters and counter-protesters chanted and threw punches and newspaper stands, according to the Associated Press.
 In the midst of the weekend brawl,  female activist Heather Heyer was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of people protesting the white nationalist rally. Far right websites have since come out supporting this act of domestic terrorism.
Here's how GoDaddy, Google, Paypal, Reddit, Twitter and Facebook have responded:

 });
 GoDaddy
 The domain name provider severed ties with the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer after the site verbally attacked Heyer. A recent post from the site mocked the deceased 32-year-old, calling her ""fat"" and ""childless."" It added that ""most people are glad she is dead, as she is the definition of uselessness.""
GoDaddy tweeted on Sunday that it had given The Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain because the site had violated the company's terms of service.
 TWEET
 In an interview with CNBC, the company's CEO Blake Irving said that the Daily Stormer crossed the line from exercising freedom of speech to provoking further mayhem.
""We always have to ride the fence on making sure we are protecting a free and open internet,"" says Irving. ""But when the line gets crossed and that speech starts to incite violence, then we have a responsibility to take that down.""
 Google
 The Daily Stormer moved its domain registration to Google after hosting firm GoDaddy cut ties with the site.
Customers can transfer domains to Google through an automated, online process that takes up to 20 minutes, according to the Internet company's domain registration site.
But shortly after making the transition, Google promptly canceled the registration for the white supremacist website.
""We are cancelling Daily Stormer's registration with Google Domains for violating our terms of service,"" the company representative said in a statement to CNBC.

 In June, the company released a blog post in which it denounced the use of Google platforms for terrorist activity. ""There should be no place for terrorist content on our service,"" said Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel of Google.
He added: ""While we and others have worked for years to identify and remove content that violates our policies the uncomfortable truth is that we, as an industry, must acknowledge that more needs to be done. Now.""
 Paypal
 The online payment platform vowed to pull its services from sites linked to hate, violence and intolerance, after reflecting on the tragic events in Charlottesville.
Paypal had previously been accused of playing a prominent role in raising money for the deadly white supremacist rally.
""We've been working directly with PayPal for months to cut off a number of hate groups that they allowed for years to generate revenue using their platform,"" says Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color Of Change, the nation's largest online racial justice organization, in a statement to CNBC.
 Source: CNBC 
 In a lengthy post published on Tuesday, PayPal says that it has a longstanding acceptable use policy and that the company strives to navigate the balance between freedom of expression and the closing of sites that advocate intolerant views.
""Regardless of the individual or organization in question, we work to ensure that our services are not used to accept payments or donations for activities that promote hate, violence or racial intolerance,"" said the post.
""This includes organizations that advocate racist views, such as the KKK, white supremacist groups or Nazi groups.""
 Reddit
 The social news aggregation site  confirmed to CNET that it will ban pages and groups linked to far-right extremists.
Reddit's action was reportedly prompted by a subreddit, which was flagged for making inflammatory remarks and threats. The thread included calls for a return to segregation and expressed hopes that someone would ""bomb CNN and kill people.""
 TWEET
 Reddit users quickly  called on the website to take steps in combating the hate speech.
""We are very clear in our site terms of service that posting content that incites violence will get users banned from Reddit,"" a company spokesperson  told CNET.
 Twitter
 The social networking service joined other Silicon Valley companies on Wednesday in suspending accounts linked to the Daily Stormer.

 At least three accounts that were associated with the neo-Nazi website led to pages saying ""account suspended,"" according to Reuters.
Although Twitter did not discuss individual accounts, the company released a statement saying that the social network will take action on accounts that violate its policies prohibiting violent threats, harassment and hateful conduct.
 Facebook
 The social media platform, which has doubled down on its war against fake news, confirmed to CNET that it has removed and banned group pages that violated hate speech policies.
 Facebook also confirmed that it had removed the Charlottesville Unite the Right event page and was currently removing all links to the aforementioned Daily Stormer post.

 Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg spoke out against the violence in Charlottesville on Monday.
She says: ""Along with millions of others, I was so heartbroken this weekend. The brave Heather Heyer's mother Susan Bro said she wanted her daughter's 'death to be a rallying cry for justice and equality and fairness and compassion. Let's honor her by teaching all of our children how to honor and respect those values.""

 Alphabet has acquired AIMatter, a start-up with Android and iOS apps that transform selfies using artificial intelligence. Terms weren't disclosed.
 AIMatter CEO Andrei Kulik and a Google spokesperson confirmed the deal to CNBC on Wednesday. The mobile apps will remain available, the Google spokesperson said. TechCrunch first reported the news.
AIMatter's Fabby apps might not be the most popular apps out there -- on Android the Fabby photo editor app had 100,000-500,000 installs -- but the technology is nifty and distinct from recently trendy style transfer in the Prisma apps and the masks that are available in Facebook and Snap's apps.
 AI researchers the world over are regularly trying to advance the state of the art in image segmentation, which involves being able to accurately outline specific things in images and video frames. Alphabet is active in this area alongside Apple and Microsoft, among others.
Kulik previously worked at Google. The company was founded in 2016 and based in Belarus.
At the Google I/O conference in May, CEO Sundar Pichai announced Google Lens, a feature in the Google Assistant and Google Photos that recognizes things seen through a phone's camera or in existing photos and then provide additional information.

Larry Page
 A lot of corporations have venture capital arms or find other ways to invest in start-ups. But Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has at least three VC arms that we know about, plus a lot of other start-up investment activities.
 This makes it an unusually influential player in Silicon Valley's start-up scene.
From a strategic perspective, this network of start-up investment vehicles lets Alphabet take early stakes in some of the hottest products built outside of the Googleplex, get a first look at emerging technologies, and ingratiate Google with the next generation of business leaders. 
 Here's a rundown of the many ways Alphabet puts money into tech start-ups.
 GV (formerly Google Ventures)
 Founded in 2009, the company's venture arm is described as an independent fund managing money for one limited partner, Google parent Alphabet. (Traditional venture firms make investments on behalf of a number of limited partners such as endowments, wealthy families and so on.) 
These days, GV aims to deploy about $500 million into promising tech start-ups every year, and has $2.4 billion in assets under management, according to founders backed by the company.
The GV portfolio includes investments in a wide range of areas, such as:
 Enterprise and business software companies such as Egnyte (online storage), Docusign (digital signatures), Slack (collaboration software for businesses) and Stripe (online payments) Consumer brands such as Uber (ride-hailing) and Walker + Co. (beauty products) Cutting-edge drone and robotics start-ups such as Abundant Robotics, Airware and Carbon 
GV has always said that it's meant to be a pure venture firm, driven by financial returns rather than to invest in start-ups that help Google's other business units. Founding partner Bill Maris (who left in 2016) repeatedly said he wouldn't be involved with a fund hampered by the ever-shifting strategy of a corporate parent. 
That said, GV has invested in 7 companies that were later acquired by Google, most notably home automation start-up Nest, which Google bought for $3.2 billion in 2014. Other tech companies that have acquired GV-backed start-ups range widely, including Yahoo, Facebook and Cisco.
Now run by CEO and Managing Partner David Krane, GV has announced about 30 new investments so far in 2017.
 Capital G (formerly Google Capital)
 Capital G, founded in 2013, is like a big sister to GV, though the two are managed separately within Alphabet.
Run by founding partner David Lawee, CapitalG makes far fewer investments each year, with just 3 in 2017 as of mid-August. It focuses on later-stage tech companies and labels itself a ""growth equity fund."" Most of the time CapitalG is investing in deals that involve at least tens of millions of dollars, according to Crunchbase data.
Its portfolio now includes established brands like the short-term rentals platform Airbnb, daily fantasy sports app Fanduel, and Glassdoor, a site that provides salary data and employee reviews of their companies.
Some of the ventures CapitalG backs are also in the GV portfolio, like payment tech firm Stripe. But unlike GV, which invests in companies based in North America and Europe, CapitalG also looks for opportunities in China and India.
CapitalG invested in Snap and Care.com, both of which are now public, and the firm sometimes holds shares in its portfolio companies after they go public.
The group declined to disclose detailed information about its fund, like how much it has invested since it was founded.
 Gradient Ventures
 As CNBC previously reported, Gradient Ventures was founded by managing partner Anna Patterson in July 2017 as an AI-specialized venture fund.
Unlike GV and CapitalG, which run as their own funds and are contained in Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" segment, Gradient is run off Google's balance sheet. The start-ups in the Gradient portfolio can also have Google engineers do rotations in their companies. 
Some of the companies Gradient has invested in so far include Algorithmia, Aurima, Cape, Cogniac and Dyndrite. 
AI is a highly strategic area for Google, and CEO Sundar Pichai has even called Google an ""AI first"" company. Alphabet has dedicated AI research groups, including DeepMind and Google Brain, and uses AI broadly in its search engine and other apps.
 Other methods
 Alphabet is known to make strategic investments in technology and infrastructure. For example, it has invested billions into clean power-generating projects and renewable energy start-ups to get closer to a goal of running its data centers on 100% renewable energy. 
Google has made some large equity investments, including joining Fidelity in a $100 million investment in Elon Musk's space exploration start-up, SpaceX, and it led a $542 million round in augmented reality start-up Magic Leap in 2014 (prior to Google's reorganization into Alphabet).
Individual Alphabet divisions outside Google sometimes invest in start-ups that are related to their missions. For instance, in March 2017, health-focused division Verily invested in Freenome, a start-up developing a blood test to detect cancer, as CNBC reported.
In 2015, Alphabet division Sidewalk Labs, which is focused on urban improvement, invested in Intersection, a company formed from the merger of Titan and Control Group that rolled out public internet kiosks called LinkNYC in New York.
X, a kind of skunkworks lab at Alphabet, took an equity stake in at least one spin-out company: Dandelion, a start-up making it easier for homes to use geothermal energy for heating and cooling. (This seems to be the exception, rather than the rule, however. More X-related projects have stayed within Alphabet so far.)
Alphabet also makes non-equity investments in nonprofits and start-ups through Launchpad, an incubator space for early-stage start-ups, and its philanthropic arm, Google.org. In 2017, Google.org has doled out tens of millions in grants to education nonprofits, including Khan Academy and StoryWeaver, that use tech to accomplish their missions. Google.org has also invested in an accelerator for tech nonprofits, Fast Forward, in San Francisco.

 12:09  PM ET Wed,  1 March 2017 |  01:06 
 Whether you're a seasoned pro or a job-market newbie, here are Neel's tried-and-tested (and Google verified) tips for crafting a winning resume.
 How would you describe your resume?
 I would describe my resume as detailed and accurate. When writing and editing my resume, I made an effort to make each of my experiences as clear and detailed as possible, while respecting the space limitations. I wanted the recruiter to have a good summary of what I did, including the technologies used and skills required.
 When you were crafting your resume, did you follow any guidelines or advice on how best structure it?
 As with most people, my resume has undergone countless revisions. I've asked dozens of people for advice regarding my resume, and sometimes the advice that I received was conflicting. I've come to realize that the kind of advice that you receive from someone is contingent on their background. A software engineer, for example, will give starkly different advice from an investment banker.
 As far as structuring my resume was concerned, I took my advice mainly from people with business backgrounds, who advised that I keep the layout very conventional unless I have a good reason to deviate. In the book ""Cracking the Coding Interview,"" Gayle McDowell gave similar advice, so I took a very standard layout and adapted it for my use case.
In one of my undergraduate business administration courses, my graduate student instructor, who currently works at McKinsey, recommended that for college students, our education should go at the top, while for older professionals, education would go toward the bottom.
 What narrative or story did you want your resume to convey to recruiters and hiring managers?
 That's a great question. My primary emphasis for this resume was to make it clear that I'm someone with a deep technical background, who is inherently entrepreneurial. To demonstrate my deep technical knowledge within computer science, I emphasize my research background and software development experience. My ""Selected Independent Projects"" serve to demonstrate my background in entrepreneurship, by highlighting two contracted applications that I developed for organizations. I similarly cite a business scholarship that I won, at the bottom of my resume.

 Why do you think this resume was so successful for you?
 For one, my research experience with the Berkeley Institute for Data Science was frequently mentioned. I think that this was a strong section within my ""Work Experience"" for a few reasons. The project was open-source, meaning that the code was freely available for anyone to view (or copy, modify, distribute, etc., for that matter). This meant that people interested in my programming experience could actually see the code that I had written.
If you're within the field of computer science, I highly recommend getting involved in an open-source project and including a link on your resume. Aside from the fact that it was open-source, it helped that the platform was built using a modern language and framework (Python with the Tornado framework). I had various projects built in PHP listed on my resume for a while, and they never received any comment. I ultimately removed them from my resume altogether.
The level of detail provided in the resume makes a difference. While I refrain from including every tiny contribution that I made in every position, the resume clearly conveys a few key takeaways from each experience. I was advised by an executive at HP to include quantitative metrics in particular. For example, rather than just saying what an application was built for, quantify it in some way. Concretely, rather than saying that I built an application for an organization, it's stronger to say exactly how many people within the organization will be using the application.
 How did you decide what to highlight and emphasize on your resume? Did you elect to delete some things in order to keep the resume to one page?
 This was the most difficult part. Like most people, I had to delete quite a bit to keep the resume to one page. Anything from before I entered college (e.g., high school experiences) were among the first items to be deleted. I've completely removed the name of my high school, although I know that many people in college elect to keep it. After college, I'd imagine it'd be strange to have a high school listed on your resume.
I have a separate document, which I don't share with anyone, where I write down all of my relevant professional experiences — small and big projects, internships, research positions, certifications, etc. When writing my resume, I picked the elements that I felt were most meaningful to me, and most accurately described my technical knowledge and professional experience. From there, I further narrowed down the list by asking various professionals who I knew. I just asked them which experiences they found to be most compelling, least compelling, etc., and I removed the less-popular items — despite how much I liked them.

 It goes without saying that it's crucial to keep it to one page. People like to say that if Sheryl Sandberg can keep it to one page, so can you, which I think is kind of silly, since it's Sheryl Sandberg; she could potentially just put her name on a piece of paper, with no other information, and she'd still ""get the interview."" But regardless, the point still stands: The resume needs to be one page max.
 Aside from Google where you are now an intern, where else did you receive internship/job offers thanks to your talents and this resume?
 I also applied for an internship at the NSA, for which I received the offer. I received an offer from Google soon after and ended up signing on early in the year, so I didn't go through the full application cycle like many other students. Aside from internships, I was offered a position in all three of the research labs that I applied to during my sophomore year.
 What, if any, feedback have you received from your Google recruiter? What did they feel was so strong or compelling about your resume.
 The Google recruiter liked my resume for a few reasons: how I utilized the space, the kinds of verbs that I used, the order in which I listed my programming languages, and the links to my open-source work.
 What advice would you give other job seekers on how to make their resumes better?
 My biggest piece of advice is to get feedback from as many people as you can, especially from people who have held positions that you're interested in. Aside from that, I would make a point to elaborate on each of your experiences. If a listed experience only has one bullet point, for example, I'd make an effort to think deeply about what you did and flesh it out to at least two or three bullet points.

 Conservatives plan attacks against tech giants in net neutrality fight   
 6:53  PM ET Fri, 18 Aug 2017 |  00:42 
 A leaked memo written by the president of a conservative lobbying group shows how the right could attack Facebook, Google and Twitter over alleged political bias, according to a new report in Axios.
 The report highlights a brewing battle over how much control internet providers and platforms should have when it comes to unpopular political viewpoints.
For instance, Google revoked domain registration services for the online neo-Nazi publication Daily Stormer this week, effectively kicking it off the internet until it could find a new provider. Cloudflare, which provides defense against hack attacks, also canceled service for the Daily Stormer, in a move that Cloudflare's CEO admitted could set a dangerous precedent. And Facebook reiterated that it would remove posts that celebrate ""hate crimes or acts of terrorism,"" in the wake of a neo-Nazi demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia, last week.
 Now, one conservative activist has floated the idea of forcing internet platform companies to declare themselves editorially neutral, or lose protection against liability for what their users post on their platforms. 
 The net neutrality battle
 The impetus for the memo is the ongoing battle over net neutrality.
Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and a Republican, is preparing to scrap rules on net neutrality put in place by his Democratic predecessor, Tom Wheeler, during the Obama administration.
The net neutrality fight pits online content providers such as Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix against broadband service providers such as AT&T, Verizon Communication and Comcast.
In broad terms, telco and cable companies argue that tech companies' web traffic uses their networks, and they'd like more freedom to set prices. 
One way they could do this would be to create tiered packages or bundles of content, based on business deals with content creators — similar to the way cable networks package TV channels today — and restrict or slow access to content that isn't in those packages. Providers haven't explicitly said they want to create tiered services or packages, but they argue they should have the freedom to experiment. Wheeler's rule prevented this experimentation, they argue.
The tech giants and their allies, however, argue that all traffic should be treated equally, or neutrally, as has been the case since the beginning of the internet. The internet's innovation would be curtailed if providers could favor certain traffic, they argue.
The latter argument won the day the last time the net neutrality fight was in court, when a federal appellate court upheld the rules Wheeler put in place.
Pai's move to reverse those rules is likely to trigger another round of fights in Congress, the courts, or both.
 What the memo suggests
 The memo, written by Phil Kerpen of an activist organization called American Commitment, suggests that conservative lawmakers could reframe the battle over net neutrality into a larger battle over neutral speech on the internet. 
""Social media (Facebook, Twitter) and search (Google) companies with dominant market position represent themselves as politically neutral while systematically promoting liberal views and limiting or even banning conservatives,"" begins the letter.
Right now, online platforms are protected under the Communications Decency Act from liability for material their users post. For instance, while a newspaper can be sued for libel if it prints something untrue written by a reporter, Facebook cannot be sued because a user posts something libelous.
Kerpen's memo suggests that the government should make internet companies promise that they're going to treat all content equally or lose this protection.
""Platforms that represent themselves to the public as neutral would be subject to enforcement actions if they violate those representations (of neutrality) through a consumer-protection framework.""
The political calculus here seems to be that Google and Facebook would look like hypocrites if they oppose this kind of regulation while at the same time arguing for regulation of internet access providers.
""By simply proposing this framework, the Trump administration would make clear that the asymmetry of companies identified with conservative causes risking regulatory retaliation while companies identified with liberals are given a free pass is over.""
Kerpen told Axios that the memo represented only ""preliminary thoughts.""
But it's an interesting glimpse into a possible political attack from the right on Silicon Valley companies.

 Damore, the author of the controversial anti-diversity memo, made the comparison  in conversation with Business Insider.
He says he was fired for ""wrong-think"" and that anyone who has conservative viewpoints at Google ""are currently marginalized.""
 ""These conservatives have to stay in the closet and have to mask who they really are. And that's a huge problem because there's open discrimination against anyone who comes out of closet as a conservative,"" Damore tells Business Insider.
Damore wrote a 10-page memo claiming the gender gap in tech is a due to biological differences between men and women, not discrimination. The internal memo went viral in early August.

 ""To suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK,"" says Pichai in an email sent to staff, obtained by Recode. ""It is contrary to our basic values and our Code of Conduct, which expects 'each Googler to do their utmost to create a workplace culture that is free of harassment, intimidation, bias and unlawful discrimination.'""
Damore believes he was fired because his views did not match those of the majority at Google.
""There is a dominant ideology at Google, and anyone who dissents against that is either shamed or ostracized. And when it became apparent that I wasn't backing down to the shame, they had to fire me.""
Damore's claim that being conservative is like being gay in the 1950's ired prominent tech journalist Kara Swisher, the executive editor of Recode, who is herself gay.
""Were you forced into electroshock therapy? No? Were you thrown out of your family? No? Did you lose custody of kids? No? Beaten?"" Swisher says, tweeting in response to the story.

 She says the comparison is unfair because it misrepresents the severity of the discrimination gay people faced. ""It's like comparing yourself to a political prisoner when you get arrested for jaywalking.""

 Google said Friday that it will introduce the next version of Android alongside the solar eclipse on Monday.
 The company already talked a lot about what's coming in this version, which had been known as ""Android O"" until now as it has progressed through beta testing. One of the biggest changes that has already been discussed is picture-in-picture mode, which will allow users to view movies while doing other tasks, an option already available on Samsung devices.
Google typically names its Android releases after desserts (Android N became Android Nougat, for example). The final name is expected on Monday as well. 
 The company will likely first release the next version of Android to its Pixel smartphones. It typically takes months or a year or more for smartphone makers to roll out Android updates to smartphones, so don't expect to see it on your phone right away.

28,2017-08-21,"The former president of 23andMe joins diabetes start-up Livongo  How this ex-Google employee got Mark Cuban to bankroll her A.I. start-up  Ahead of big events from Samsung and Apple, Google reveals new update, Android Oreo  Traffic on Google Maps clearly showed the path of the eclipse  Google has no cloud business in China, which will make it hard to catch up with Amazon  ","Andy Page, formerly president of Google-backed 23andMe, is joining Livongo, a chronic disease management start-up, as its president and chief financial officer.
 Livongo's goal is to help patients with diabetes manage their disease before they end up getting seriously ill. The idea is to suggest lifestyle or medication changes well before the user ends up in the emergency room.
It does this by offering a blood glucose monitor and unlimited supplies like strips to those with diabetes, and monitoring their condition over time. A Livongo coach is available at all times to provide actionable feedback if the readings are outside of normal bounds. If there's no sign of improvement, a specialist might step in.
 ""The idea is to reduce strain on the health-care system,"" said Page, who left 23andMe earlier this year. The company presented data at the American Diabetes Association's annual meeting to demonstrate that it saved $83 per participant per month on health-care costs, which was 5.8 percent lower than those not enrolled in its program.
Livongo works with payers, such as self-insured employers like Pepsi and FedEx, that are looking for ways to reduce health costs, and sells its diabetes management program directly to consumers for $49.99 per month.
Some 30 million people in the U.S. have diabetes.
The company is looking to expand into monitoring other chronic conditions, including hypertension and depression.
Livongo CEO Glen Tullman left his role as the chief executive officer for Allscripts, a multibillion-dollar health IT company, to start Livongo in 2014. Tullman has seen firsthand the challenges of managing chronic ailments as the parent of a son with type 1 diabetes. Since then, Livongo has raised more than $140 million in venture capital financing.
Page didn't rule out an initial public offering, saying it would be ""consistent"" with Tullman's background.
Other start-ups in the space include Vida Health, founded by former Google vice president Stephanie Tilenius, and Andreessen Horowitz-backed Omada Health.

 });In 2011, Falon Fatemi was building a career consulting in the start-up world. That year, she went to South By Southwest, a music and tech festival in Austin, Texas, popular among entrepreneurs.
 Amid the crowd, she met a ""really smart guy,"" and the two started talking about ideas that companies in the tech industry were missing out on.
That guy was Mark Cuban. But Fatemi had no idea who he was.
 ""This was about six years ago. I mean he was popular, but I don't think he was as big a celebrity as he is now with 'Shark Tank' and all of that,"" she tells CNBC Make It, referring to his role as an investor on the ABC reality show.
Still, Fatemi remembers the first conversation they had. ""I was sharing a few billion-dollar market opportunities that I thought were untapped,"" she says, like ways to leverage technology in the government.

 ""He was like 'Man, we could totally solve this. Let's talk about this more,'"" she says. ""So we were kind of nerding out."" 
The two stayed in touch, and Fatemi says they would catch up when Cuban was in the San Francisco area, where she lived.
The connection came in handy. When Fatemi founded her AI data company, Node, in 2015, she reached out to Cuban to pitch him as an investor.
 Source: Node
Node CEO Falon Fatemi with investor Mark Cuban.
 By then Fatemi knew his pedigree, but she didn't let that intimidate her. She had learned the importance of taking risks and the value of your network when she was hired at Google at just 19. There she worked with influential women like Stacy Brown-Philpot (now CEO of Task Rabbit) and Kim Jabal (current CFO at Weebly), and she was in the occasional meeting with Sheryl Sandberg (COO at Facebook).
""I actually felt fairly confident about reaching out and sharing my story and pitching [Cuban], because I was prepared,"" she says.
""I met with a lot of my advisers and investors that were my friends, and I didn't ask them for money, I actually asked them for advice first and feedback on my pitch,"" she says.
""I had prepared for that situation, I had prepared for that meeting [with Cuban].""
Fatemi's company, Node, aims to use artificial intelligence and data to help organizations target new customers. Basically — who to contact, what to say, and when. 
""We help [clients] understand the world of people and companies that they should be selling or marketing into,"" she tells CNBC's Squawk Alley.
After Fatemi's pitch, Cuban was in. He tells CNBC Make It he was willing to back the company because it addresses a pain point — it eliminates guesswork for salespeople.
""I've always been a fan of cold calling and while there is still a place for it in small organizations, I invested in Node because it is effectively the 'cold call killer,'"" Cuban explains. ""Their ability to exploit corporate information combined with personal networks and web-based information to generate not just leads but well-informed connections is a game-changer.""
Today, Node's other backers include investors like Avalon Ventures — which led the company's Series A funding round — NEA and Canaan Partners. It announced a total of $16.3 million in funding in July.
In Cuban, Fatemi says she's found a mentor, adviser and a real partner for the business, emphasizing his interest in AI and knowledge of the technology space. 
""Most people, they think Mark Cuban — they think he is this TV personality, or that he is just a sales guy,"" she says. But really, ""Mark is pretty technical.""
Cuban sold his computer company MicroSolutions to CompuServe in 1990 and later sold his radio streaming company, Broadcast.com, to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in 1999. 
""He is as hands on as I want him to be,"" she says. ""In my more stressful moments, he is also there just to share his stories and his experiences because he has been in my shoes.""
Some of Cuban's best advice? Fatemi says it was learning that ""cash is king.""
Fatemi says that Cuban ""has a vision for what he believes the future will be and he's got the grit and understanding of what it takes to get there.""
The respect is mutual.
""[Fatemi] is smart, driven and focused,"" says Cuban.

 Google's latest operating system update now has a name: Android Oreo.
 The operating system is part of the artificial intelligence software push Google announced earlier this year at its annual developer conference, Google I/O. Google said in May that it would improve Google Photos and expand the reach and capabilities of Google Assistant.
The company showed off some new features on Monday that promise to extend battery life and increase security for Android users.
 Tweet: Unveiling of the Android O statue. It's Oreo!
 The new features are part of Android O, the latest mobile operating system. The most noticeable features are redesigned emojis, dots that tell users when there's an update in one of the apps and a screen setting that shows two apps at once.
Behind the scenes, though, there will also be changes to make Android phones more efficient, Google said on its blog. For instance, the new operating system will have stricter security controls on apps, faster loading times and limits on apps prone to battery overuse.

 Samsung's premium handset, the Note 8, and the next iPhone, likely called the iPhone 8, are both expected to be revealed in the next couple of months.
Google has stepped up its ambitions in mobile hardware over the past few years with the introduction of the Pixel, the first handset designed by Google ""inside and out."" The marriage of high-end, powerful hardware with Android software will help Google prepare for an ""AI-first world,"" executives said last year.
Google faces some steep competition in making its artificial intelligence play, Google Assistant, the tool of choice.  The gradual rollout of Android O to Google's Beta Program, Pixel and Nexus devices could provide a closer look at how the new features stack up.
Among home devices, Amazon's Alexa has had an early lead, dominating technology events such as this year's CES. And Apple is expected to release a handset in September that would be a huge leap forward for mobile devices. All the while, Android co-creator Andy Rubin is also coming out with a line of devices, only some of which use the Android platform.
Google typically names its Android releases after desserts (Android N became Android Nougat, for example).

Diane Greene, Sr. Vice President for Google's Cloud businesses.
 In its bid to compete with Amazon Web Services, Google has opened data centers in four countries outside the U.S. this year and has plans to launch in five more before 2019.
 But one big market is not on the list: China.
Google's absence, which stems from a long-standing feud with the world's second-biggest economy, is costing the company business and making it harder to challenge AWS and Microsoft Azure in the rapidly expanding cloud infrastructure market. 
 Earlier this year, one of Google's marquee cloud clients, Snap, cited the service's unavailability in China as a reason that it may not be able to enter the market. Days later, Snap disclosed a deal with AWS, which opened a region of data centers in Beijing in 2014. 
Snap didn't say if China played into the AWS deal, but it's clear that Alphabet's cloud business is missing out on one of the biggest areas of growth in tech.
China's market for cloud infrastructure and software will more than quadruple by 2021 to $9.8 billion from $2.4 billion last year, according to IDC. To build a presence there, AWS partnered with a local company, Beijing Sinnet Technology, as did Microsoft, which teamed up with 21Vianet for data centers in Beijing and Shanghai. Internet data center licenses in China can't be granted to foreign companies.

 The market leader, according to Gartner, is Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which said last week that its cloud revenue for the latest quarter almost doubled to $359 million. Chinese internet companies Baidu and Tencent also have cloud offerings.
Without a physical presence in China, Google is at a major disadvantage in trying to serve emerging businesses that are turning to the cloud for computing, storage and a growing number of applications and features. Its closest data centers are in Taiwan and Singapore. 
AWS, meanwhile, is in the process of setting up a second Chinese region -- in Ningxia -- as well as opening a Hong Kong region.
Google already has a big gap to close. According to Synergy Research, Google is fourth in global cloud infrastructure with 5 percent of the market, trailing AWS, Azure and IBM. With such a small presence, Google has plenty of places it can grow and is opening cloud locations in countries including India and Brazil.
""Google today is in so few countries -- they have a lot of other fish to go fry,"" said Lydia Leong, an analyst at Gartner, in an interview.
 Google previously explored opening a data center in Hong Kong, but in 2013 the company told the Wall Street Journal that it altered its plans. Google executives have told partners that the company would like to set up a China-based cloud service ""eventually,"" tech website The Information reported in January.
Google didn't answer several questions about its strategy for China, and offered only the following statement by e-mail: ""No plans to bring Google Cloud to China.""
To understand why Google is a no-show in the Chinese cloud market, you have to rewind the clock to 2010.
That year, Google made a radical change in its operations in China, breaking with the country's practices of censoring internet content. Google shut down the local service, redirecting visitors from Google.cn (the mainland site) to the uncensored Google.com.hk in Hong Kong. When the Chinese government objected, Google put up a landing page telling users to navigate to the Hong Kong site.  
 'Have to cooperate'
 ""We heard about Google's plan of returning to China but so far there is not any clear message,"" said Richard Zhao, a senior research manager at IDC and an expert in China's IT market. If they're going to open, ""they have to cooperate with local partners to run public cloud services,"" he said.
It seems unlikely that Google Cloud would make a big push in China without the prospect of core services like search and Google Maps going live there as well. 
But in recent months, under the leadership of Diane Greene, Google's cloud business has shown a heightened level of autonomy. It was Greene who announced in June that Google would stop scanning Gmail users' emails to personalize ads. And in the first half of 2017, Alphabet's biggest growth in headcount was in cloud.
Ruth Porat, Google's finance chief, told analysts that the cloud growth is ""consistent with the priority we place on this business.""
Clearly, that priority has yet to reach China.

 Snap won't easily pull a Facebook-Google-Alibaba. The messaging app's stock is 20 percent below its initial offering price. Its big internet predecessors encountered similar territory before roaring back and beyond. Evan Spiegel's creation could snap back, but it's on weaker footing and losing money.
The company behind rainbow filters and dancing hotdogs debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on March 2, with its shares soaring 44 percent above their $17 IPO price. Two disappointing quarterly results and an expired lock-up period have altered Snap's trajectory. The stock hit a low on Aug. 11 at $11.83.

Google Vice President of Product Management Mario Queiroz shows the new Google Home during Google I/O 2016 at Shoreline Amphitheatre
 Google is building a new laptop and a smaller version of its Google Home smart speaker, according to a report from Android Police.
The site said Google's new laptop will be a ""Pixel-branded Chromebook."" Chromebooks run Google's Chrome OS operating system, which it has tried to market to schools as low-cost alternatives to Windows and Mac devices.
 Google's Pixel laptops aren't usually that affordable, however, and have been marketed toward developers. Since Pixel has become Google's hardware brand, however, perhaps this will be a more consumer-focused product.
The smaller Google Home speaker may be a play to take on the Amazon Echo Dot, a smaller version of the Amazon Echo that costs just $50. The device is often on sale for as low as $35, and could allow Google to attract folks to its products who might otherwise buy the more affordable Echo Dot.
Google has put a lot of emphasis on its Siri competitor, known as Google Assistant, that's available on Android phones and on the Google Home. It allows users to stream music, cast movies to a nearby Chromecast-enabled TV, check traffic and more. Sacrifices will likely need to be made in order to keep the cost of a smaller device down. In the Amazon Echo Dot, that meant lower quality speakers.
The devices will reportedly launch at an event Google is planning to host this fall, where it is also expected to unveil its new Pixel smartphone.
Google did not immediately reply to a CNBC request for comment.

 Google is trying again to push Chromebooks into big businesses, the core market for Microsoft Windows   
 4:34  PM ET Tue, 22 Aug 2017 |  00:57 
 Google's Chromebooks have made inroads in the education market, so much that Microsoft has built its own Windows laptop to compete with them.
 Now Google looks keen to take share in Microsoft's real stronghold: big companies.
On Tuesday Google is launching Chrome Enterprise, a service that will give IT admins inside enterprises the ability to manage devices running Google's open-source Chrome OS desktop operating system, using tools they're already familiar with. The new license, which will cost $50 per year per Chrome OS device, is an enhancement of the Chrome device management license that's been available since 2011.
 Admins can start using existing user profiles in Microsoft Active Directory software running in on-premises data centers for managing employees' Chromebook use. Additionally admins will be able to manage Chromebooks from VMware's Airwatch enterprise mobility management software, with alternatives to come later.
The new license is Google's attempt to improve the software part of the equation to get big companies to buy more Chromebooks. Google has previously tried to entice companies with discounts on Chromebooks themselves. More recently Google has gotten third-party hardware makers to develop non-laptop Chrome OS devices, including a Samsung convertible tablet with an integrated stylus.
Worldwide Chromebook shipments were up 38 percent in 2016, while the overall PC market dropped 6 percent, Gartner said last month.
The move comes after Apple has partnered with Cisco, Deloitte, IBM and SAP in an effort to get iOS devices into enterprises. Both Apple and Google are eager to displace Windows in the enterprise.
To make Chromebooks more versatile and less limited to what's available on the web, Google has been taking steps to bring the Google Play Store to Chromebooks, opening the door to millions of Android apps. The Play Store now works on more than 25 types of Chromebooks, and company administrators can restrict or allow specific Android apps to be run on Chrome OS devices, Google group product manager Eve Phillips told CNBC in an interview.

 Cramer: Google has more work to do to compete with Amazon's Alexa   
 10:40  AM ET Wed, 23 Aug 2017 |  02:16 
 Tech giant Google has much more work to do if it wants to compete with Amazon's virtual assistant Alexa and its Echo speakers, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday. 
 Alphabet's Google announced a new partnership with Wal-Mart on Wednesday that will allow the retail giant's customers to purchase products through Google's voice-enabled technology.  
The team-up came as Wal-Mart advances its e-commerce operations to compete with Amazon, which currently holds an edge in the voice-shopping market.
 ""I don't think Google Voice shopping is going to be as accurate as Amazon voice shopping,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street.""
""They have more work to do on voice. Voice is everything,"" he added. ""Google Voice is not as good as I think people think it is."" Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Cramer applauded Wal-Mart for having an answer to the ""dark star"" that is Amazon's Alexa. But added that perhaps Wal-Mart should have reached out to tech company Nvidia.
""So, this is an answer. I don't think it is a coherent an answer,"" he said. ""If you want to play this, I'd play it with Nvidia.""
But Wal-Mart's head of e-commerce, Marc Lore, said the partnership with Google makes sense. 
In a blog post, Lore said the tech giant has made ""significant investments in natural language processing and artificial intelligence to deliver a powerful voice shopping experience.""

 Google throws lifeline to desperate retail industry besieged by Amazon   
 5:58  PM ET Wed, 23 Aug 2017 |  00:48 
 Wal-Mart is hitting back at Amazon, hard.
 Emboldened by its recent acquisitions of Jet, Bonobos, Modcloth, and others, the retail behemoth has signaled that it is rebooting its e-commerce business to compete more effectively with ""The Everything Store."" 
The public equity markets have rewarded Wal-Mart for its strategic shift. Since the Jet deal closed in September 2016, Wal-Mart's stock is up 10 percent, adding over $20 billion in market cap despite only 1 percent quarter-over-quarter revenue growth during that period.
 This week, Wal-Mart extended its competitive ambitions beyond M&A by  partnering with Google to enable Google Assistant and Home to purchase items directly from Wal-Mart. While I admire Wal-Mart's desire to partner with software companies outside its areas of core competency, this move will likely be less effective than Wal-Mart's other initiatives in its fight against Amazon.A  study by Bloomreach in 2016 showed that 55 percent of product searches begin on Amazon, so in many categories Google (and therefore Wal-Mart) has already lost. In those other categories, picking a dominant retail partner presents massive channel conflict for Google and will likely upset its other advertising partners.
Google is therefore not likely to use its full power at the top of the funnel to drive that intent towards Wal-Mart alone, even though it might be the right thing to do for customers. At best, Google will implement a soft version of this preferential treatment in its voice products, but that's not where most of Google's users are today. Reading a bit into the headline of Google's  press release (""Shop Wal-Mart and more of your favorite stores, faster""), Google is likely treating Wal-Mart on equal footing with its other Google Express shopping partners like Target and Costco.Google's unique advantage is its dominance in internet search. Its neutral position in that ecosystem is inconsistent with these types of partnerships, as far as Wal-Mart is concerned. In comparison, Amazon's fully integrated offering presents no channel conflict and is already the leading voice interface. Unlike its M&A deals to date, the Google/Wal-Mart partnership will do little to curtail Amazon's lead.

 Google throws lifeline to desperate retail industry besieged by Amazon   
 5:58  PM ET Wed, 23 Aug 2017 |  00:48 
 The retail business is shrinking dramatically. While Amazon and Google and Wal-Mart duke it out for retail supremacy on the internet, vast swaths of the retail space have been reduced to micro-cap status, with tiny market valuations that make it impossible to borrow money and fund economic expansion.
 Amazon and Wal-Mart are the two giants of the retail space, with market capitalizations of $464 billion and $241 billion, respectively. But 60 percent of the roughly 97 stocks in the Retail ETF (XRT) now have market capitalizations below $3 billion, which qualifies them for small-cap status.
 Small-Cap Retailers (Market Cap) American Eagle Outfitters: $1.9 billionDillard's: $1.6 billionJ.C. Penney: $1.1 billionChico's: $991 millionBarnes & Noble: $541 millionExpress: $430 million 
 J.C. Penney has a roughly $1 billion market cap. Some have even descended to micro-cap status, now valued at $300 million or less:
 Micro-Cap Retailers(Market Cap)Cato: $347 millionFrancesca's: $283 millionFred's: $233 millionHibberts: $231 million 
Here's a delicious irony: Amazon's old rival, Barnes & Noble, now has a market cap of $540 million. Amazon has a market cap approaching $500 billion.
That means Amazon has a market value roughly 1,000 times its old rival.
And those are the ones that have survived.
Ken Perkins at Retail Metrics noted that at least two dozen retailers have gone bankrupt in the past two years, including The Limited, Wet Seal, RadioShack, Payless and Gymboree. Many that are left are ghosts, trading under $10 per share.
""Amazon has essentially leapfrogged the entire industry and came up with a lot of other innovative ideas ahead of everyone else, particularly Alexa,"" Perkins told me.
Will any of this ever change?
Wednesday morning, The New Yorker published a long article, ""Who Owns the Internet?"" — where writer Elizabeth Kolbert argued, ""It is troubling that Facebook, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon have managed to grab for themselves such a large share of online revenue while relying on content created by others. Quite possibly, it is also anti-competitive.""
Indeed, there has been a growing chorus arguing that Amazon and Google are simply too large, from USC professor Jonathan Taplin, who authored the book, ""Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy,"" to NYU Stern School of Business professor Scott Galloway — a founder of advisory firm L2 — who has received considerable attention for a lecture he gave in July, in which he argued that Amazon, in particular, should be broken up.
Cooper Smith, who advises retail clients with Galloway's firm, L2, thinks we may be years away from a serious discussion on breaking up Amazon, but he advises retailers to not sit around and wait for that to happen.
He thinks Wednesday's announcement that Wal-Mart is partnering to sell some of its products on Google Home is significant for struggling retail survivors: ""A lot of luxury brands like LVMH, which has refused to touch Amazon with a 10-foot pole, are talking about banding together to create a new luxury e-commerce space. Amazon hasn't been able to disrupt that market yet. Google and Facebook are the platforms with the reach, those are the alternative platforms that would help brands and retailers reach consumers without having to partner with Amazon.""
Chris Horvers, retail analyst at JPMorgan Chase, was on CNBC Wednesday morning with a similar sentiment: ""Wal-Mart's move to enable voice ordering and linking the history is really important. The idea is if we can get the Home Depot's and the Costco's to enable that and the Target's to enable that same feature, you start to develop an alternative platform to Amazon. ... We need to create an alternative site where the rest of retail can go and create critical mass from a customer's perspective.""
That's likely one reason many retailers are trading up Wednesday.

 Take that Alexa! Wal-Mart partners with Google to offer voice shopping   
 11:25  AM ET Wed, 23 Aug 2017 |  00:55 
 Wal-Mart is about to encroach even further on to Amazon's turf.
 The big-box retailer will soon offer customers the ability to order hundreds of thousands of its products by voice with the help of Google.
The partnership is another critical step as Wal-Mart looks to advance its e-commerce operations, staying competitive with Amazon and its powerful voice-enabled network Alexa.
 While other retailers are already working with Google to sell their products using Google Express — including Target, Costco, Whole Foods, Ulta and Kohl's — none of these companies thus far has allowed shoppers to link up a pre-existing user account with Google Express on the back end.
Wal-Mart also will be offering the largest number of items through the Express platform.
Beginning in September, Wal-Mart shoppers can link their Wal-Mart accounts to Google Express and quickly order — either through voice on Google Home or by shopping on Google Express. By linking a shopper's past Wal-Mart purchase history, Google will be able to more quickly learn the customer's shopping patterns and recommend suitable products.
Using the platform now, a customer can say, ""Google, buy peanut butter."" Google will then suggest the brand it thinks the customer would like the most.
But Google is just guessing, explained Brian Elliott, general manager of Google Express. He told CNBC that the process of going back and forth, asking if a customer wants this or that, can be clunky.

 Once the partnership with Wal-Mart launches, however, Google can scan the customer's purchase history, and respond: ""I know you bought Skippy, 16-ounce, from Wal-Mart last month. It's $7.99. Do you want that?""
That's the power of this combination. While other retailers are on the Express platform, Wal-Mart will be the first with this capability.
""It makes sense for us to team up with Google,"" Wal-Mart's head of e-commerce, Marc Lore, said in a blog post. ""They've made significant investments in natural language processing and artificial intelligence to deliver a powerful voice shopping experience.""
""We know this means being compared side-by-side with other retailers, and we think that's the way it should be,"" Lore added. ""An open and transparent shopping universe is good for customers.""
As of Wednesday, Google also began offering free delivery on Google Express orders so long as the order is above each retailer's minimum threshold. Wal-Mart, for example, will have a threshold of $35 for free delivery when its deal is live.
""We're thrilled to partner with one of the most popular stores in America to help make your shopping faster and easier,"" said Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president of ads and commerce.
And with Google's platform, no membership is required, Ramaswamy pointed out.
 An ongoing battle
 With more consumers beginning to rely on devices like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, it's easy to see why retailers want to stay on top of the trend. Amazon had a leg up with its integrated system, but Wal-Mart doesn't plan on being left behind.
Wal-Mart, with its brick-and-mortar fleet, and Amazon, with its e-commerce operations, have been neck and neck as far as the retail world is concerned, each company rolling out fresh initiatives to stay ahead of the other.
Wal-Mart acquired Jet.com last fall, beefing up its digital arm. Post-Jet merger, the retailer grew online sales 60 percent during the second quarter of 2017, following 63 percent growth in the first quarter of the year.
For now, Jet's products, which include those sold by Modcloth and Bonobos, won't be available through Google Express.
Meantime, Amazon is looking to grow its real estate portfolio, preparing to seal a deal to acquire Whole Foods. The grocer's shareholders vote on the deal on Wednesday.
Come September, Wal-Mart and Amazon will offer consumers the ability to order a catalog of products through voice shopping. ""This is just the beginning,"" Lore has said.
""Next year, we will also leverage our 4,700 U.S. stores and our fulfillment network to create customer experiences that don't currently exist within voice shopping anywhere else,"" Lore wrote in his Wednesday blog post.
This will include using voice command to pick up orders in store and using voice shopping to purchase fresh groceries, he said.
Separately, Wal-Mart also has been testing a pilot delivery service with Uber, which expanded to additional cities this week.

Apple AirPods
 Google may soon launch its own set of headphones to compete with Apple AirPods.
 References to the headphones were recently discovered by 9to5Google in code buried inside the Google application.
The code specifically notes a product named ""Bisto"" and says: ""Your headphones have the Google Assistant. Ask it questions. Tell it to do things. It's your own personal Google, always ready to help.""
 The code also suggests that Google's Android partners will be able to build their own versions of the smart headphones.
Apple's AirPods have been so popular that they've been hard to find ever since launch; only recently is stock starting to pop up in some retailers without long shipping delays. Their design, which allows users to charge the headphones when they're not in use, is particularly compelling. Support for Siri, too, allows users to speak commands without pulling out an iPhone.
Google is expected to host an event this fall where we should see new Pixel phones and, if other rumors are correct, a new Google Chromebook and a smaller Google Home speaker.
CNBC reached out to Google for comment but a spokesperson was not immediately available.

 Amazon goes for the throat   
 8:01  PM ET Thu, 24 Aug 2017 |  05:33 
 Google's partnership with Wal-Mart won't affect Amazon's ascent because similar deals between the search engine and other large retailers have had ""little to no impact"" on the growth of Amazon's shopping services, according to Cowen research.
 The partnership between Wal-Mart and Google, announced Wednesday, will give shoppers the ability to order hundreds of thousands of products from Wal-Mart by voice through Google Express, its online shopping service.
The deal is another strategic step by Wal-Mart to advance its e-commerce operations to compete with Amazon's powerful voice-enabled network Alexa.
 Google Express came about in 2013 and has deals with Costco and Target, which offer similar goods as Wal-Mart, Cowen analyst John Blackledge said, but those partnerships have ""had little to no impact on Amazon's retail business or the growth of Amazon Prime households.""
""While we are encouraged to see Google continue to enhance its eCommerce/Shopping offering, we believe the attention the announcement received was overblown,"" Blackledge wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.
As of Wednesday, Google also began offering free delivery on Google Express orders so long as the order is above each retailer's minimum threshold.
Amazon said Thursday that its acquisition of Whole Foods will close Monday, promising ""more to come,"" as the internet giant begins to integrate its Prime membership offerings into the Whole Foods network. Prime members will eventually receive ""special savings and in-store benefits.""
Shares of Amazon pared earlier losses Thursday afternoon and sat down 0.33 percent at 3:09 p.m. ET. Shares of Wal-Mart fell after the announcement of the Amazon-Whole Foods deal closure, now down 1.92 percent.
While attention has largely been focused on Wal-Mart's new opportunities from the deal, Cowen research also noted that Google could see a meaningful uptick in its Express service.
""Of the United States households purchasing groceries online each month (about 12 percent of U.S. households on average), only about 4 percent bought groceries via Google Express in July '17,"" added Blackledge.
That stands in stark comparison to the 46 percent of online grocery shoppers who said they bought goods on Amazon Prime, according to the Cowen report.
Still, the analyst said he isn't persuaded that the Google-Wal-Mart agreement means much for Amazon.
""Amazon's end to end voice-enabled shopping solution is a significant advantage versus the Wal-Mart/Google pairing in our view. Overall, we do not see the partnership impacting Amazon's US retail biz and/or Prime Sub penetration.""

The D-Wave 2000Q Quantum Computer
 Morgan Stanley said quantum computing will have dramatic implications across several industries during the next decade.
 Quantum computers use atomic particles and the laws of physics to perform calculations. They are faster than current computers and will enable much higher computing power, according to Morgan Stanley.
""With more companies moving quantum computers from the lab to commercial activities, we believe widespread quantum computing is about to become a reality and holds the key to double the high-end computing market,"" the firm's research team wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.""We believe quantum computing could trigger the beginning of a fourth industrial revolution, with far reaching consequences for many sectors where computing power is becoming a limitation for R&D.""
 Here are the industries and applications Morgan Stanley said will be most affected by the new computing paradigm:
 ""Financials, Pharma (drug discovery), Oil & Gas (well data analysis), Utilities (nuclear fusion), Chemicals (polymer design), Aerospace & Defense (plane design), Capital Goods (digital manufacturing and predictive maintenance), Artificial Intelligence, and Big Data search in general."" 
The firm said IBM, Google, Microsoft and Nokia Bell Labs currently have the ""most credible"" quantum computing pipelines.
With faster computing, ""classical algorithms, which would take years to solve on a current supercomputer, could take just hours or minutes on a quantum computer,"" they said. The analysts said that, according to IBM, the current size of the high-end computing market is $5 billion to $6 billion per year. Morgan Stanley predicts the market will grow to $10 billion a year in the next decade due to the rise of quantum computing. ""We expect the next 10 years to see a rebalancing favoring commercial vs consumer computing as quantum computers are able to solve many problems that could not be solved up until now,"" they wrote.

 There is now a Google test for depression and mental ill health   
 1:53  PM ET Wed, 13 Sept 2017 |  00:55 
 Google has teamed up with a mental illness group to provide Americans with a test to check if you are depressed or mentally ill.
 People in the U.S. who type ""clinical depression"" in Google search via a mobile device will now be invited to check if they are clinically depressed via a screening questionnaire.
 Source: Google
 The partnership, announced Wednesday, has been developed by Google and the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI).
 In a blog post on Google, the CEO of NAMI Mary Giliberti, said she wanted to use Google to increase the proportion of U.S. citizens who actually seek help for depression.
""Clinical depression is a very common condition, in fact, approximately one in five Americans experience an episode in their lifetime.
""However, despite its prevalence, only about 50 percent of people who suffer from depression actually receive treatment,"" Gilberti said.
Google said those who click through from the search suggestion will see a ""Knowledge Panel"" which will give you an option to ""check if you are clinically depressed"".
The test, called a PHQ-9, is described by the search engine as a clinically validated screening questionnaire and is designed to test what level of depression a person may be suffering.
Giliberti said the results can help people then have a more informed conversation with their doctor.
""Clinical depression is a treatable condition which can impact many aspects of a person's life. The PHQ-9 can be the first step to getting a proper diagnosis,"" Giliberti added.
The NAMI CEO said people who have symptoms of depression experience an average of a 6 to 8-year delay in getting treatment following the onset of symptoms.

Members of the media examine Google's Pixel phone during an event to introduce Google hardware products on October 4, 2016 in San Francisco, California.
 A blogger with an accurate record, Evan Blass, said this week that Google will unveil its new smartphone on Oct. 5.
 The Google Pixel 2 is expected to succeed the original Pixel and will be among the first new smartphones that will run Google's new Android Oreo operating system, which was officially launched this week.
 Read the Tweet here
 The Pixel 2 will reportedly operate on Qualcomm's brand new Snapdragon 836 processor, which would make it among the most powerful smartphones on the market. The device is expected to look like last year's model instead of packing an edge-to-edge screen, which has become a trend among new smartphones.
This is probably the fall event that other rumors have referenced, which means Google may also take time to unveil its new Chromebook laptop, a smaller Google Home and a set of headphones that may compete with Apple's AirPods.
While Blass has an accurate track record, it's common for these events to shift to another date at the last minute. CNBC reached out to Google for comment but a spokesperson was not immediately available.

32,2017-08-25,Google issues refunds to advertisers whose ads ran on sites with fake traffic  ,"Bloomberg | Getty Images
Sundar Pichai
 Google issued large refunds to some online marketers whose ads were placed on sites with fake traffic, suggesting its ad-buying technology may be subject to more fraud than the company previously acknowledged.
Some of the refunds were as large as ""hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.
 The refunds are being made for ads bought with the company's automated technology, known as DoubleClick Bid Manager.
The company says it's working on ways to give marketers more transparency into the automated ad technology, used by advertisers to place ads across the internet on websites of Google's ad partners.
Google said last month that tests it had run ""confirmed how widespread of an issue this is for publishers.""
The refunds also suggest there is a downside to a recent push by Google to make it easier for advertisers on its partner sites to reach a bigger audience.
On a conference call with investors in April, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said:
""As marketers continue to shift to its programmatic ad buying, our DoubleClick platform makes it easy for them to effectively reach the right audiences. We've been focusing on making more inventory available to more advertisers, especially premium inventory.""
A spokesperson for Google, a unit of Alphabet, declined to comment on the details in the  Wall Street Journal report, but confirmed that the refunds were made for ads placed on partner sites with fake traffic created by bots, or automated software programs that pretend to be legitimate users.
""We can't comment on specific details of ad fraud but the vast majority is filtered in our systems before our advertisers are ever impacted or charged... In our own platforms, we're working with our exchange partners to remove monetary incentives for spammers and increase transparency for buyers,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email.

 Google just announced a tool that will allow developers to write augmented reality apps for millions of Android devices. 
 Augmented reality allows developers to overlay digital content on top of the real world. The lion in the image above, provided by Google, appearing to stand right on the street, is a good example of one fun use-case. 
This is a big deal.
 The developer tool is called ARCore and is a direct answer to Apple's ARKit, which allows iOS developers to make AR apps for iPhones and iPads.
Until now, it seemed as though Google didn't have an answer to Apple. Google had been investing in its Tango augmented reality platform, but that required special hardware and sensors on new smartphones. It wasn't really going anywhere.
Now, without having to rely on new hardware, Google can get augmented reality apps out to existing Android phones. 
Google says it hopes that AR apps will be up and running on 100 million devices before the developer tools are even out of preview. Phones that will support augmented reality include the Galaxy S8 and the Pixel.

 });The teenage years aren't always the smoothest, and life was no different for four of the world's most successful chief executives.
 They may be heavy hitters now, but before they made it, they included an awkward adolescent, a teen factory worker, a ""terrible"" student and a 16-year-old who held three jobs. 
Bill McDermott, now CEO of software giant SAP, loved the scent of success as an adolescent. Having the gumption to buy a business is impressive at any age, but McDermott snapped up his neighborhood delicatessen for $5,500 — at the age of 16.
 It wasn't bankrolled by his mom and dad: He'd been working since the age of 11, and by the time he bought the Amityville Country Delicatessen, Long Island, he also was running a paper route and waiting tables.
""I was actually simplifying my life. I had three part-time jobs. One of them, of course, at that time was the deli itself,"" he told CNBC's TV show ""The Brave Ones."" ""So I had a little bit of an inside scoop on how to work the deli. But how I did it was simple. The owner of the business wanted out, so there was a good motivation. And he was willing to trust me, because no one else wanted to buy it.""

 The teenage businessman
 The teenage McDermott had built relationships with the store's vendors and got his first orders on consignment. He also got to know his customers well. ""One of the interesting little nuances of that deli is 500 people come in and out every day and getting to know them.
""You see, I had a very interesting CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system back then. You know what it was? It was a window. And I could look through that window and I knew everything about my customers.""
 CNBC
Bill McDermott, chief executive of SAP
 McDermott saved enough money to put himself through college, buy cars, clothes and insurance. He also learned how to be a great salesperson. He got a job at Xerox at 21, and by 24 was a sales manager, the youngest applicant for the job at the time. Eventually he joined SAP, becoming president of global sales at its Asia-Pacific and Latin America divisions before becoming joint CEO in 2010 and sole CEO in 2014. So what did that teen experience teach him?
""It goes right back to that deli or walking the (Xerox sales) beat in Manhattan door to door. If you can help the customer get what they want, they will help you get what you want. But you gotta get the ordering of those priorities right,"" he told ""The Brave Ones.""
 A rags-to-riches tale
 Money was also a motivator for the teenage Zhang Xin, now the billionaire CEO of real estate company SOHO China. Growing up in Beijing under the Mao regime, her family had little, so when she moved to Hong Kong as a teenager, she was determined to make a better life for herself.

Zhang Xin as a young graduate
 It did not come easy: She worked in factories for five years. ""We did not know what other way to live, than just finding whatever job was out there to make a living,"" she told ""The Brave Ones."" And even though her work was monotonous, it gave her a freedom she'd never had. ""I really felt free in Hong Kong … I could buy anything I wanted to buy. I could eat anything I wanted to eat. And I could wear anything I wanted to wear.""
As a sweatshop worker, a big personal motivation was to make more money, so she moved from job to job to get small raises, dreaming of making enough to leave.
Her parents ""worked for the government as intellectuals. So working in the factory was never my ambition. And I knew that I had to do that, because I need(ed) to make a living. But I also knew that I would look for any opportunity to get out of it,"" she said. After work, Zhang would go to night school, and finally made enough money to move to the U.K., where degrees at Sussex and then Cambridge University were partly funded by grants and scholarships.
 CNBC
Zhang Xin, chief executive of SOHO China
 After a stint in finance, Zhang set up real estate developer SOHO China with husband Pan Shiyi, and their net worth is now around $3.6 billion.
The advice she would give her younger self? ""Oh, just go for it. Go for your dream, whatever dream you have. And don't (be) worried about (what) people think. (If they say) 'This is ridiculous,' often it's the most ridiculous ideas that turn out to be the best.""
 Crazy dreams
 A ridiculous idea turned out to be the making of entrepreneur Michael Dubin, who started subscription razor company Dollar Shave Club from his apartment in 2012, knowing nothing about the business of shaving. He sold it to Unilever for $1 billion in 2016, remaining as CEO.

 Friend Ben Jacobsen told ""The Brave Ones"" that this ""relatively hair-brained idea"" was initially dismissed by many. ""There were a hell of a lot more people that told him that this was a foolish idea that he should quit, that he shouldn't waste his time or money.""
Dubin's high school years didn't exactly pave the way for success, his mom Nancy Dubin said.
""He started out high school in the local public high school. And it wasn't the first time that reports were sent home that he was the class clown. That he's never going to amount to anything was one of the conferences that we went to,"" she said.

 ""If things interested him, he was a fabulous student. If it was a subject that didn't interest him at all he was probably a terrible student,"" she said.
Yet it was that clowning around that helped Dubin score a hit with his first commercial for Dollar Shave Club. He wrote and starred in ""Our Blades are F---ing Great"" in 2012, a YouTube ad that has now been watched almost 25 million times.
 The teen geek
 While Dubin was the class clown, scientist and Google X founder Sebastian Thrun was more of a nerdy teenager, spending his spare time programming a Texas Instruments TI-57 calculator.
""Between (the) age of maybe 12 and 14, I spent every afternoon programming it. It has 50 steps, so it memorizes keystrokes. And I programmed video games. I programmed geometric calculations and all kinds of stuff,"" he said.
""I am an odd bird. Maybe I'm socially challenged or what have you. But at a time when computers weren't used by anybody, I came across this programmable calculator ... And I developed a passion for lying in bed and just figuring out what can you do with 50 programming steps.""

 As a teen, Thrun admitted that he preferred the company of machines. ""At the time, it was intriguing that there was something around me in my world, (and) when I told it to do something it actually did it, right? Because everyone else around me, my parents, my siblings, and so on, I would say, 'Do this,' and they would never do it.""
He eventually got a real computer around the age of 16.
""Then something bizarre happened. I kind of lost interest a little bit … I became more interested in people. And I almost felt that while computers do exactly what you tell them to do, that's what makes themboring. I think the nuances of human interaction (are) a much more interesting thing.""
The blend of human traits and computer science led Thrun to become a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence before winning a self-driving car race across the Mojave Desert, founding Google X and eventually quitting to start online education business Udacity.

34,2017-08-30,Google Assistant will soon let you control your washer and dryer  ,"Todd Haselton | CNBC
 Google announced Wednesday that its voice assistant, better known simply as Google Assistant, will be coming to appliances this year.
Google said washers, dryers and vacuums will soon gain voice controls. Need to run the dishwasher? A command like ""OK Google wash the dishes"" might start your washing machine. Google says it's partnering with companies such as LG to build the new products.
 The idea of controlling appliances with a voice assistant isn't new, but it's starting to become more popular. Amazon partnered with LG to bring its Alexa assistant to a new LG refrigerator earlier this year, for example. Alexa can already control other appliances, including robotic vacuums.
Google also announced on Wednesday that its voice assistant is coming to new speakers built by Panasonic, Mobvoi and Anker, which means they might serve as additional options for folks who don't yet own a Google Home device.
Google said it will discuss specific Google Assistant-enabled products over the coming days.

35,2017-08-31,Amazon Alexa vs. Google Assistant: The battle for connected future dominance is on  ,"Todd Haselton | CNBC
 IFA is one of the largest consumer electronics shows in the world. The largest device makers in the world from Samsung to Lenovo tend to stage flashy launches at the event which takes place in Berlin, Germany.
 But quietly in the background, two players with barely any branding anywhere are making the most noise: Google and Amazon. 
Construction of booths was still ongoing on Thursday ahead of the opening day on Friday. Companies like Sony, Panasonic and Samsung were putting the final touches on their giant stands.
 But tucked in the tiny corner of the venue, in one of the smallest halls, was a stand for Amazon Alexa, the e-commerce giant's voice assistant. So far, no Google branding could be spotted.
The low-key presence of these two from a brand perspective is deceiving because they were in fact all over the place. In many of the product launches, from many different companies, either Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant was mentioned as a partner.
 Source: Amazon
 Chinese firm Qihan for example integrated Alexa into its humanoid robot called the Sanbot Nano. Sony released a 230 euro ($272) smart speaker, similar to the Amazon Echo, but with Google Assistant as the main voice feature. Meanwhile, LG announced that all of its smart home devices released in 2017 will be compatible with Google Assistant. That means users can ask the voice assistant things like how long is left on the cycle of their LG washing machine.
It's an absolute land grab by Amazon and Google, two tech behemoths who are leading the way in artificial intelligence (AI). And there's a few reasons why. 
Firstly, the more devices that each voice assistant is on, the smarter it will become because it has large amounts of data available. 
But the most important strategic reason is that the so-called internet of things (IOT) is becoming reality. That is, an increasing number of devices are becoming connected and Amazon and Google both want to be major players, without actually making much hardware.
Think what has happened in smartphones. There are two dominant operating systems: Google's Android and Apple's iOS. Owning these has allowed Apple and Google to become major mobile players and reap the revenues from their respective app stores and other services.
As of yet, there is no unified ""smart things"" operating system. It's disjointed, expensive, and not seamless, like we have come to expect on mobile. But there's rising interest in voice assistants which could prove to become the operating system of the IOT. You can control devices without screens and those assistants can almost become your handy helper.
Amazon missed the mobile wave in terms of hardware and software, but this could be its chance to become a major IOT platform. And the reward could be a significant new revenue stream. In a report earlier this year, RBC predicted that Alexa could bring Amazon $10 billion of revenues by 2020 and be a ""mega-hit.""
Think about a world with Alexa all around you. Imagine now what Amazon could sell you. The vision is similar for Google. Ads and e-commerce could give the search giant some new revenues. 
There's potentially a lot at stake and it's risky if voice doesn't take off. But neither Amazon nor Google wants to miss out and that's why this epic landgrab to get on as many devices as possible is set to continue.

Juicero
 Juicero, the start-up that raised over $100 million in venture funding to create a juicing machine that originally sold for $700, said on Friday that it's closing up shop.
Inspired by brands like Keurig and Sodastream, Juicero presses required the use of squeezable fruit pouches that were shipped to customers' doors and had to be refrigerated.  The machine was designed by Yves Behar's studio, Fuse Project.
 The company twice dropped the price of the machine, first to $400 and then even lower, according to a Fortune story in July. (A company representative said in an email that the second planned price drop never happened.) Juicero's troubles were initially exposed in April by Bloomberg, which reported that the fruit pouches could be squeezed by hand with similar results. 
Investors in the company included Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), and Campbell Soup's venture arm.
Juicero announced the shutdown in a  blog post and cited the challenges of creating a nationwide distribution system. Juicero also offered refunds for the next 90 days to customers who had ordered its presses.
""We are confident that to truly have the long-term impact we want to make, we need to focus on finding an acquirer with an existing national fresh food supply chain who can carry forward the Juicero mission,"" the company wrote.
Juicero founder Doug Evans previously started a juice bar business, Organic Avenue, which went bankrupt in 2015. The Juicero story has already become a cautionary tale for hardware and food tech investors.

But lately, it has been specializing more. Most recently, it launched Gradient Ventures earlier this year to fund early-stage artificial intelligence companies and bolster access to Google's engineering talent. 
Verily's model is tailored to the medical sector, which represents about a fifth of the economy. Alphabet, alongside Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, are all looking to slice out a piece of this $3 trillion health care pie. 
 Partner space
 In an interview, Harrison described the Verily model as a ""partner space.""
It takes a page from existing models such as start-up accelerators and co-working lab spaces but with a few key differences. Unlike many of these programs, Verily might invest but it doesn't need to. It can rent out the space instead.
In either case, according to Harrison, it will do a ""venture-like review"" on any medical start-ups that apply. 
Verily has space for about 5 to 10 start-ups at any given time, he said.
Two of these spots have already been filled by Culture Robotics, a biotech tools start-up, and Freenome, a diagnostics company working on an early-stage cancer test. Verily made an equity investment in both companies.
Culture Robotics' Will Patrick chose to join the partner space to work in close proximity to Verily's team of scientists and engineers. It also proved to be an affordable option for the start-up given the Bay Area's astronomical rent prices.
""As a small company, being part of the partner space helps us get off the ground more quickly,"" he said.
Harrison is hoping to work with companies that are in a complementary space, which gives Verily a fairly wide remit to invest across the bio-tech and digital health ecosystem. 
The company's dozen or so projects include a glucose-tracking contact lens and assistive tools for people with impaired movement. Its current partners include some of the world's largest pharma and medical device companies, ranging from Dexcom to Sanofi.

Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene.
 Alphabet's Google has picked up more support for a key piece of its cloud strategy.
 On Wednesday the San Francisco start-up Mesosphere announced the upcoming availability of a beta version of Google-led open-source software called Kubernetes inside its flagship software.
These tools handle the work of deploying containers, which package up application code just like the virtual machines that VMware popularized, on several physical servers. While virtual machines are arguably more widely used (and have been around longer), containers are thought to be more efficient and easier to move to other server infrastructure.
 Two years ago Mesosphere did incorporate a modified version of Kubernetes, an alternative to the Marathon system it primarily supports, into its DC/OS tool, which can operate databases and other software in addition to deploying containers. But now the start-up is dead-set on delivering the latest version of Kubernetes in DC/OS, starting with version 1.10.
The Information originally reported the news and described it as an indication that the start-up was giving in to a Google-backed technology.
But in a call with CNBC, Mesosphere executives suggested that wasn't right because its DC/OS offering does more than just run containers. 
Companies can run DC/OS atop public clouds or on their own data center infrastructure, and doing so can be more cost-effective than raw public cloud because of its typical pricing model, Mesosphere CEO Florian Leibert told CNBC in an interview.
Uber, for example, uses Mesosphere's software to run a database called Cassandra.
""If you do some simple math and you put that into the AWS [Amazon Web Services] calculator, you come out with a yearly cost -- the lower end of that is $6-10 million that Uber would have to pay AWS for equivalent functionality,"" Leibert said. ""Even if you use the highest-end servers with our software, it would be half or a third of that.""
If anything, the move further distinguishes Mesosphere from other companies that provide distributions of Kubernetes, the start-up's marketing chief, Peter Guagenti, told CNBC.
""We have the most enterprise customers, the most containers in production, and we're the one with the most revenue of all the startups in the space,"" Guagenti said. ""As far as we're concerned, we've been really successful to date. This adoption for us is a way to extend that success and cover more use cases.""
Google made the Kubernetes source code available for free in 2014, and subsequently introduced a managed version of Kubernetes on its public cloud, so admins wouldn't have to worry about setting up and running it. Microsoft has built Kubernetes support into its Azure Container Service. AWS does have a service for launching code in containers on its servers, but it's not primarily based on Kubernetes.
The fact that Kubernetes keeps code tucked inside computing units that can be switched to another cloud is key to Google, precisely because it's not the top cloud. Big companies can feel comfortable about not getting ""locked in"" to the Google cloud -- and adopting Kubernetes could make it easier to use multiple public clouds at once.
Historically that's not something that Amazon has talked about a lot, presumably because it wants customers to stick with its market-leading cloud exclusively. Nevertheless, AWS was thinking about building a Kubernetes service, The Information reported earlier this year. Even if that were to happen, Mesosphere would continue to emphasize the advantages of paying for a Mesosphere subscription instead, as it enables a variety of computing capabilities for a single price, Leibert said.
Mesosphere's investors include HPE, Microsoft, Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures. 
Microsoft did attempt to acquire Mesosphere but ultimately the deal didn't work out, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC. Leibert wouldn't comment on that.

38,2017-09-07,Google is apparently ready to buy smartphone maker HTC  ,"Beck Diefenbach | Reuters
Brian Rakowski, VP of Product Management at Google, speaks about the Pixel phone, during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S.
 A report from a Taiwanese news outlet called Commercial Times says Google is in the final stages of acquiring all or part of smartphone maker HTC.
 The news follows a separate story from late August that suggested Taiwan-based HTC was interested in some sort of sale.
HTC, once one of the more popular smartphone makers in the United States, has fallen off of most carrier store shelves after several consecutive unsuccessful smartphone launches. It recently launched a separate division that sells virtual reality headsets.
 The report seems fishy, since Google has already been down this road, but there's a reason why Google might be interested in HTC.
The Taiwanese company builds the Google Pixel, which means it could be a good fit for Google as it continues to cater to consumers with its ""Pixel"" smartphone brand.

 HTC U11: Will 'Edge Sense' be a winner?   
 11:25  PM ET Tue, 16 May 2017 |  01:54 
 Here's where it sounds off base: Google acquired Motorola Mobility and then sold it off just a couple of years later. Why repeat that move?
Commercial Times said HTC's poor financial position and Google's desire to ""perfect [the] integration of software, content, hardware, network, cloud, [and] AI,"" is the driving force behind Google's interest. The news outlet said Google may make a ""strategic investment"" or ""buy HTC's smartphone R&D team"" which suggests that the VR team would exist as its own.
UBS analyst Eric J. Sheridan explained in a note on Thursday why Google might want to push further into hardware:
 From a strategic standpoint, owning & operating its own mobile operating division would offset some of the key strategic challenges that Google's mobile computing business might face: a) a deeper integration of hardware/software would offset some of the Android fragmentation issues that do not plague Apple iOS; b) development cycles that maximize forward mobile computing trends (Google Lens, location, ARCore, Google Assistant) with possible greater user adoption; c) an offset to rising Distribution TAC expenses; & d) an offset to any negative industry dynamics (unbundling of apps) resulting from the European Commission's Android investigation. 
Sheridan said a Google acquisition of HTC would be ""immaterial to Alphabet"" given its $95 billion cash stash.
Google and HTC declined to comment to CNBC.

These are Google's company mottos, designed to embody the company's self-described progressive values.
But then scholar Barry Lynn — a vocal supporter of antitrust regulations against Google — was pushed out  last week from the New America Foundation, a think tank which had received major financial support from Google. The move called the tech giant's public-interest ethos into question.
More from Vox:""We shouldn't reflexively send $10 to the Red Cross""A psychologist explains the limits of human compassionCollege football is a moneymaking sham
 In his  June statement for the New America Foundation, Lynn ""congratulated"" the European Union's decision to levy a record-breaking, $2.7 billion antitrust fine against Google. EU regulators found that the company had unfairly directed customers toward its own shopping platform, denying them a ""genuine choice.""

 });
 Google was, reportedly, not happy with the statement. According to Lynn, Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt, also chair of New America up until 2016, quickly responded that the company wanted to ""sever all ties with the organization.""
Lynn was fired, and New America severed ties with Lynn and Open Markets, Lynn's project within the think tank, starting on September 1st. New America denies that the firing was due to pressure from Google, though  emails from the think tank's leadership suggest otherwise.
To understand the broader economic and political forces that may have played a role in Lynn's departure, I spoke to media critic Douglas Rushkoff. Rushkoff, a New York–based writer and professor at Queens College, has also been critical of Google's rise to power; his latest title is ""Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus: How Growth Became the Enemy of Prosperity."" We discussed, among other topics, the consolidation of power in the tech industry and the impact of private interests on free speech.

 Top Google exec shares his secret to a good night's sleep   
 10:39  AM ET Tue, 18 April 2017 |  00:51 
 Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.
Hope Reese: 
Lynn's departure from New America has been viewed, largely, as illustrating the influence a powerful company like Google can have on scholarly discourse. How do you see the news?
Douglas Rushkoff:
What we know for sure is that people around the world are becoming more conscious of the particular way that technology mega-corporations are working to change the legal and media landscape.
Jeff Bezos buys the Washington Post so that his technology platform monolith has a voice. In Google, we have a situation where the world's largest technology platform is also the world's largest advertising platform. Things start to get messy. Google's also the nation's  biggest lobbyist in DC.
Does that mean Google is evil? Not necessarily. But their influence is very big. It wouldn't be surprising to see organizations of all kinds accommodating the needs of one of these companies or another, whether it's a publishing house accommodating Amazon books or New America accommodating Google's lobbying arm.
Reese:
Does this illustrate the kind of power the large tech companies have? Is this a trend that will continue?
Rushkoff:
From the period of chartered monopolies in the 1300s until very recently, the power of a monopoly was maintained by law. You lobbied for certain laws in order to get charters or monopolize a certain industry. You'd fight antitrust laws. Now, monopolies are exercised through code, rather than just law. Through manipulation of the landscape itself.
That's what we started to realize in the late '90s when Microsoft had both the operating system and the browser, and people began to say, ""Oh, there's this other way of doing monopolies now."" But it also amplifies and accelerates the process for a monopoly to happen. Amazon happened really, really fast. And their platform gives them the ability. As soon as they  bought Whole Foods, everybody goes, ""Oh my gosh,"" and the stocks of other grocery stores went down.
These are all digitally-accelerated phenomena. The worry is different. And the main reason is that these companies are, themselves, communications companies and publishers. It's not just a phone company or an electric company or a cement company. They're also the platforms we use to interact. It becomes bigger.
The New America article is not that big of a deal, in itself. The reason it's a story is that it's emblematic of a new kind of monopoly. If anything, these sorts of foundations, and the kinds of publishing they do, were the last safeguard. The last seemingly untouched, unsullied place.
Everything else is owned by one or the other of the same five companies. If there's so little money out there that's not Bezos, Schmidt, Murdoch, Zuckerberg ... if they're the only ones left to keep these organizations alive, the space for genuine, independent work is getting smaller and smaller.
Reese:
For me, it's troubling that scholarly thought is influenced by corporate money, which I had always thought was separate.
Rushkoff:
It's totally not. Look how much effort and manpower major universities spend on development and fundraising. Who are they appealing to for that money, and how does that influence their spending and research agendas?  Eighty families own half of the money on the planet right now. Where are you going to go for money? One of those families. This is a side effect of wealth consolidation.

 Adam Grant bashes viral google memo, saying the differences between men and women are slim to none   
 12:54  PM ET Tue,  8 Aug 2017 |  01:00 
 Even look at me. I'm going to have a book coming out. And Anne-Marie Slaughter [president and CEO of New America] knew the title of my previous book, ""Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus,"" and what it was about, and New America sponsored an event for my book. It was about how we got to a place where runaway growth of tech companies impoverishes people and places. So I'm not in a position to say anything bad about New America — why should I bite the hand that feeds me? We're all in a precarious position. We're all dependent on the same five companies to keep us in business. That sometimes means negotiating a harrowingly narrow path between ethics and patronage.
All of the NGOs are beholden to their sponsors, and it's good to understand that.
Reese:
Allegedly, Eric Schmidt immediately contacted New America to say they were unhappy with Lynn's support of the EU antitrust fine against Google. How is that not suppressing scholarly research?
Rushkoff:
This is the core problem with neoliberalism. Whoever's paying for your bread ends up having some say in what happens. It's the reason the economics and business departments in America all still spout Milton Friedman-style free-market capitalism — those people paid for the chairs, and the departments, and the grants.

 They went on an anti-socialist, pro-business platform. This is the way it works. Jack Welch, when he was head of GE,  would call CNBC's news desk saying, why is a channel we own saying bad things about GE as an investment?
And this is Schmidt's perspective. Why is a place, one that we're paying for — and the reason we're paying is because open markets means open internet, means open for advertising, means open for Google — [challenging us]? He sees what they've written and says, wait, I thought we were all on the same page here!
No, I don't like this.
Reese:
After this, will it be difficult for New America to remain a credible source, in the eyes of the public?
Rushkoff:
Unless Anne-Marie Slaughter comes out with something really good, some counter-something, it not only exposes the reality behind the connection between funding and output at New America, but exposes the way that all of these NGOs and think tanks are beholden to the people who fund them. A think tank has two choices: Either find sponsors who agree with what you want to say, or learn to agree with what your sponsors want to say. It's almost impossible to do anything else.

40,2017-09-13,Former Google employee apologizes for sparking rage with a 'Bodega' app  Ex-Google employees want to make bodegas obsolete  ,"For two former Google employees, the launch of their new app may not have gone exactly as planned.
 Paul McDonald and Ashwath Rajan released an app called Bodega on Wednesday, which seeks to disrupt convenience shopping, reports Fast Company. Almost immediately, city dwellers rose up in defense of small neighborhood stores both on social media and in the real world.
McDonald responded to the heated reaction with a blog post on Medium.
 ""The name Bodega sparked a wave of criticism on social media far beyond what we ever imagined,"" he writes. ""Despite our best intentions and our admiration for traditional bodegas, we clearly hit a nerve this morning. And we apologize to anyone we've offended.""
McDonald defended the business, too. He argued that it set out not to eliminate traditional bodegas but to supplement them.

 });
 ""Challenging the urban corner store is not and has never been our goal,"" he writes. ""Corner stores have been fixtures of their neighborhoods for generations. They stock thousands of items, far more than we could ever fit on a few shelves.""
Here is what the company does, according to Fast Company: Bodega sets up  ""pantry boxes filled with non-perishable items you might pick up at a convenience store. An app will allow you to unlock the box and cameras powered with computer vision will register what you've picked up, automatically charging your credit card."" The company plans to put them in offices, apartments, gyms, and college campuses according to its website.
There are currently 30 live Bodega locations in the San Francisco area. TechCrunch reports that Bodega has raised $2.5 million in financing.
The company is facing some serious criticism. For example, Frank Garcia, chairman of the National Association of Latino State Chambers of Commerce, says just using the name ""Bodega"" is offensive.
""The 'bodega' name is a very important name in the Puerto Rican and Hispanic community,"" Garcia tells CNBC Make It. ""It has always been a house for immigrants to buy in. With all of the anti-immigrant issues, I think using the name 'Bodega' is an issue."" 
When first asked by Fast Company, McDonald said he wasn't worried about the name.
""We did surveys in the Latin American community to understand if they felt the name was a misappropriation of that term or had negative connotations, and 97 percent said 'no,'"" he tells the publication. ""It's a simple name and I think it works.""
And then there's the Twittersphere. The word ""bodega"" is trending thanks to the app, and people — many of whom see local bodegas as part of their communities — are not happy.
 Fast Company notes that the company's cat-shaped logo is a reference to the ""bodega cat"" meme. 
 Others pointed out that the idea is not exactly innovative.
 One of the founders told TechCrunch that, until now, ""there's really only been two options: you can go to the store, or you can order something online. What we're trying to do is introduce a third option, a new way of buying things. Shrink the store, bring the best parts in a smaller form factor and bring it to where you are.""

 Chamath Palihapitiya: Facebook and Google have become 'surveillance states'   
 6:32  PM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  01:55 
 Even though he was once an executive at Facebook, Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings, favors investing in Amazon instead, he told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report"" on Thursday. 
 President Donald Trump has been a critic of Amazon, tweeting his disdain for coverage from The Washington Post, which is a personal holding of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. But Palihapitiya said he thinks that Facebook and Google face more regulatory risk, given the many retailers that compete with Amazon.
""Amazon is a microscopic portion of global consumption today, so ultimately I think it has more room to grow before it invites regulatory overview,""  Palihapitiya said. ""On the other hand, Facebook and Google effectively are surveillance states. And they have so much personal, private information about so many citizens of so many countries."" 
 Google has already had a tussle with regulators in Europe, after the company was slapped with a record fine in one investigation.
""It's already beginning,"" Palihapitiya said. ""Because it's part and parcel to them realizing that there's too much power unbounded."" 
Palihapitiya noted that many big technology companies have seen their stocks soar, making it tempting to take gains. Palihapitiya's holding company, which also includes former Twitter executive Adam Bain, hit the public markets Thursday.
But Palihapitiya said he thinks investors should reframe the way they think about the long-term trajectories of the companies. 
For instance, Amazon is competing against Wal-Mart, which has acquired e-commerce companies like Jet.com and Bonobos. But with tools like Alexa, robots and cloud, Amazon's technology could lead it to victory over ""laggard competitors,""  Palihapitiya said. 
""It is competing against fundamentally impaired companies, including Wal-Mart, quite honestly,""  Palihapitiya said. ""That don't have the technical savvy, they don't have the capabilities, specialty retailers, an entire overhang of cost structure that [Amazon doesn't] have to deal with.""
Facebook, Google and Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Allbirds CEO: Sustainable shoe craze takes run at footwear space   
 7:05  AM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  04:21 
 Will it be the Warby Parker of shoes?
 Allbirds has already won over Silicon Valley, where the business is based, with its wool sneakers spotted on the feet of Google co-founder Larry Page, former Twitter chief Dick Costolo and venture capitalists Ben Horowitz and Mary Meeker, to name a few.
And after growing a successful e-commerce platform, Allbirds will test its fate in setting up a second physical storefront to showcase its products. Allbirds' ""concept"" shop opened Thursday in New York's SoHo neighborhood, bringing the brand to the East Coast.
 The direct-to-consumer company, which just debuted last year, opened its first brick-and-mortar location in San Francisco in April.
""The most important thing for us is to have an interaction with every customer we exchange a product with money for,"" co-founder Joey Zwillinger said Thursday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
""And we've tried to make it as affordable as we can.""
Allbirds' sneakers are made from renewable merino wool, and they're being marketed as ""the world's most comfortable shoes.""
The company has raised $27.5 million in equity since its inception, from partners including Tiger Global, Elephant, Maveron and Lerer Hippeau Ventures.
Its two versions of shoes — with and without laces — run about $95 apiece. And for now, consumers can get their hands on a pair only through Allbirds' website or at one of its two stores.
The New York location features a life-size hamster wheel, where shoppers can test out running in the sneakers before they buy. Zwillinger said opening the brick-and-mortar shops has allowed Allbirds to create more of an ""immersive"" experience.
Online retailers moving offline is no new trend, either.
Warby Parker — the start-up that has disrupted the eyeglass retail market — is among the businesses that started as digitally only and opened shops for customers to try the product before they buy. Others include Rent the Runway, Bonobos and UnTUCKit. 
At its New York store, Allbirds will be selling shoe laces inspired by the colors of the NYC subway. It will also have on sale an exclusive version of its ""Starry Night"" shoe.
The Silicon Valley start-up has manged to grow its business organically, without the help of a third-party platform like Amazon. But Zwillinger won't count out the idea of opening up to other outlets some day.

 India's billion plus customers are in the sights of internet giant Google who are reportedly set to release a mobile payment service in the country.
 Digital payment platforms can earn money in a number of ways as operators skim percentages from transactions costs, charge to advertise seller products or earn interest on cash held in escrow.
Indian news site 'The Ken' has said that ""Google Tez"" is set to be released as an app that supports other consumer payment services and will also link to a government backed payment system called UPI.
 'Tez' which means fast in India could be in place as soon as next week, according to the report.
Various local media have reported a press conference invite sent out by Google India which said the tech giant would, on Monday September 18, announce, ""the launch of a new product developed grounds-up for India.""
Google has had limited success with its mobile payment systems. Two years ago the company launched Android Pay following the failure of its earlier product Google Wallet. Most mobile phone users in India favor the Android operating system.

Sabrina Ellis, Director of Product Management at Google, speaks about the new Pixel phone during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016.
 Tired of hearing about the iPhone X? Google clearly is, as the Mountain View company has just debuted a new marketing campaign and website that urges viewers to ""ask more."" The new landing page is part of the madeby.google.com subdomain, and it carries the teasing tagline of ""thinking about changing phones?""
It was on October 4th, 2016, that Google launched the Pixel and Pixel XL, the first phones to be officially branded as out-and-out Google phones (in fact, the official Pixel name is still ""Pixel, Phone by Google""). Exactly a year later, Google seems set to return with a new generation of Pixel devices. In fact, the company is reprising its big marketing push from last year by already  erecting billboards teasing its launch event.
The ""ask more"" instruction appears to tease an evolved and improved Google Assistant, one that presumably does more when you ask it for more. For now, all we have to go on is the teaser video from Google and a  litany of leaks detailing the features and looks of the upcoming Pixel 2, made by HTC, and Pixel 2 XL, expected to be manufactured by LG and based on the promising, bezel-deprived V30.
 So what exactly is Google promising? Here's a list of the rhetorical questions that the company's teaser video throws at us:
 What's wrong with my phone's battery? Why is my phone always out of storage? Why does my phone take so many blurry photos? Why doesn't my phone understand me? Why can't my phone update itself? Why is my smartphone so slow / hot / fragile / annoying / broken / cruel / impersonal / dumb? 
Most of these are self-explanatory, but here's some speculative context. The blurry photos question would seem to suggest optical image stabilization (OIS) being added to this year's Google Pixel, something the 2016 edition lacked.  HTC's U11 has some of the best OIS in the business, consistently eliminating the blur produced by shaky hands from photos that look comparatively softer on the Pixel. And Apple just managed to put OIS on both of its iPhone X cameras, so Google will want to keep up in having that important spec.
As to the points about fragile, hot, and broken phones, that might be Google's way of taking a dig at the current trend of every device going for full glass covers on both the front and back. Yes, Samsung made it look very luxurious and premium with its Galaxy S and Note lines, but glass is glass, and these  increasingly expensive devices do seem to also be growing more fragile. Anything Google can do to reverse that trend would be a plus.
The cruel, impersonal, and dumb comment seems to be targeting the iPhone and its Siri personal assistant. Most Android flagships now ship with Google's Assistant on board, so the only relevant devices out there that aren't intelligent enough in Google's estimation must be iPhones. It's interesting that Apple didn't mention Siri once in its entire presentation of the revolutionary iPhone X, whereas Google is making the Assistant and its smart capabilities a key selling point of the Pixel phones.

 Why Google's upcoming phone is more exciting than the iPhone X   
 12:10  PM ET Fri, 15 Sept 2017 |  00:40 
 I'm more excited for Google's smartphone event on Oct. 4 than I am for the launch of the new iPhone X.
 Leading up into Apple's event earlier this week, CNBC and most of the media knew all there was to know about what Apple had in store. Three iPhones were unveiled, including the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. No surprises there, aside from the naming scheme.
The two iPhone 8 models are minor upgrades to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone X looks exactly like every leaked image that cropped up all year, and what might have been surprises, like Face ID, were expected.
 Don't get me wrong. I look forward to seeing it in person and maybe even buying one, but there really wasn't anything we didn't know about, and the whole unveiling was kind of yawn-worthy.
We even knew that the phone wouldn't launch in September (which is still a bummer.) The Apple Watch Series 3 and Apple TV 4K were also leaked ahead of the event. CNBC even scooped an announcement Apple made about working with Stanford on new heart studies.
Google's Pixel 2, on the other hand, still remains a mystery.
The only reports I've seen suggest that the smaller model will be built by HTC, which manufactured both models of the Pixel this year. A larger Pixel 2 Plus (or whatever it might be named) will be built by LG, according to rumors.
It might not offer a fancy edge-to-edge display (or maybe it will?) but it will run Google's new Android Oreo operating system that looks more powerful and clean than ever before. Also, Google recently announced its own augmented reality tools, which I hope are discussed during the event.
Unlike Apple, Google is expected to adopt Qualcomm's latest modems that support next-generation Gigabit LTE networks, too. That means, as all U.S. carriers start rolling out networks with much faster data speeds (think 5x -to 10x faster than current speeds), you'll be able to use them. My guess is Google will talk a bit about VR, too, which Apple has yet to discuss.
But mostly, I'm excited because I don't really know much at all about what Google has in store. Whatever it gets up on stage and announces will be a surprise. That's exactly the opposite of what happened during Apple's iPhone 8 and iPhone X event.

 Facebook has come under fire in recent weeks for advertising practices that allowed Russian trolls to buy space and enabled advertisers to target users based on anti-Semitic search terms. 
 The solution to troubling internet ads, according to one author and professor, may be to take cues from TV ads. 
""When you buy advertising on a TV network, you have to disclose who paid for it and where it's coming from,"" said Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the University of Southern California's Annenberg Innovation Lab, on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Monday.
 Facebook and Google, on the other hand, are protected by a safe harbor law that allows advertisers to remain anonymous, Taplin said. 
The FCC is tasked with regulation of TV ads -- demanding such transparency as in-ad payment disclosures -- but internet ads fall under the purview of the FTC. 
""We've had a very lax regulatory regime, but my guess is they will have to start doing this,"" Taplin said. ""It will lead to more regulation and you're right that the Europeans are starting that.""
The European Union earlier this month introduced guidelines for internet giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter to more quickly remove illegal content from their sites. The recommendations aren't legally binding, but lawmakers have said more legislation could follow.

Reed Hastings, chief executive officer of Netflix, speaks during a news conference in Tokyo on Monday, June 27, 2016.
 Despite Netflix's huge rally this year, a Wall Street firm says the stock will go even higher based on an analysis of Google search data.
 Piper Jaffray told its clients on Monday that the video streaming company could have as much as 42 percent year-over-year gains in its international subscriber base in the third quarter, in line with the consensus estimate. Analyst Michael Olson also predicted that domestic subscriptions will increase 10.9 percent from the third quarter last year, which is higher than the 10.7 percent consensus estimate.
Netflix had 51.9 million domestic members as of the end of June and 52 million international members.
 Olson reiterated his overweight rating on the stock and his price target of $215, which is 18 percent higher than Netflix's Friday closing price.
But the analyst said the analysis of Netflix search trends on Google points to potential domestic growth of 16.2 percent and international growth of 78.3 percent. While the analyst noted that the Google search model is likely ""overstating"" subscription growth potential, ""it is clearly positive from a directional perspective.""
Piper Jaffray's search analysis had a 96 percent correlation with Amazon's retail sales unit growth in the previous 20 quarters.
""We believe Netflix is well positioned to have over 100 million international subscribers by 2020, along with ongoing operating margin expansion as the company spreads content and marketing spend over a growing installed base,"" Olson wrote.
Netflix is one of the market's best-performing stocks, rallying 47.3 percent this year through Friday compared with the S&P 500's 11.7 percent gain.
The analyst detailed several ways Netflix could reach 164 million subscribers worldwide by 2020 — and that excludes business in China.
""Our 2020 year-end subscriber estimate of 164 million worldwide assumes 64 percent domestic and 19 percent international share of broadband subscribers (excludes China from addressable base),"" Olson said. ""While this level of penetration (domestically) is higher than most comparative subscription entertainment products, we believe the content/value ratio offered by Netflix is, and will continue to be, higher than other relevant comparative offerings.""
Last quarter, Netflix crushed Wall Street's estimates, adding 5.2 million total members versus expectations of 3.23 million. Netflix is set to report third-quarter earnings mid-October.

The new iPhone 8, iPhone X and iPhone 8S are displayed during an Apple special event at the Steve Jobs Theatre on the Apple Park campus on September 12, 2017 in Cupertino, California.
 Apple's smartwatch and iPhone announcements last week set off a wave of excitement among consumers and investors.
 But they also highlighted a harsh reality for start-ups — it's nearly impossible to compete with big brands in consumer electronics.
Those following in the footsteps of DJI, GoPro, Fitbit or Keurig are now finding it hard to raise funds beyond an early seed round. With well-funded companies like Juicero failing and Intel shutting down its wearables division, investors have cooled on consumer electronics in 2017.
 ""Investments in consumer hardware are down partly because some of the consumer and internet-of-things devices haven't really delivered,"" said Cyril Ebersweiler, a veteran hardware investor and general partner at SOSV. ""Other start-ups are doing well but taking longer to scale than most investors would like.""
At HAX, a hardware-focused accelerator funded by SOSV, a majority of start-ups in the latest batch are focused on anything but consumer devices, Ebersweiler said. Instead they are making niche health and medical devices, or industrial hardware like systems for use in logistics, farming and manufacturing.
The same thing was seen at Y Combinator, another prestigious accelerator, where hardware start-ups in the last batch included zero consumer electronics companies, but did include companies working on autonomous and unmanned aerial vehicle tech.
So which hardware companies are in a good position to raise venture capital these days? A midyear report from Osage Partners' Natasha Azar said: ""'Big swing' investments are on the rise in areas such as quantum computing ... edge processors, robotics and non-traditional computing.""
Ebersweiler said this could become a lasting cycle. When investors don't make big, follow-on investments in them, hardware start-ups won't go after the biggest opportunities in consumer markets. That's because it takes a lot of money to manufacture and market devices (let alone hire great tech talent) when you're up against Apple, Amazon and Google.

 A cybersecurity expert who has protected Google's systems for 15 years said Monday no one is safe from internet attacks and software powered by artificial intelligence can't help defend them.
 Heather Adkins, director of information security and privacy and a founding member of Google's security team, also advised consumers not to put sensitive personal information in their online communications.
""I delete all the love letters from my husband,"" Adkins told several thousand people gathered for TechCrunch Disrupt 2017, a technology conference in San Francisco, after telling them ""some stuff"" like personal information shouldn't be put in emails.
 Network attacks ""can happen to anyone ... anywhere,"" Adkins said during an onstage interview in which she urged startups to assume they would get hacked eventually and to prepare a response plan.
Google has said that more than 1 billion people use its Gmail program.
Adkins' remarks came several days after the credit-monitoring firm Equifax revealed what may be the largest data breach to date.
Adkins explained that AI-powered security software is not particularly effective at stopping even 1970s-era attack methods, let alone more recent ones.
""The techniques haven't changed. We've known about these kinds of attacks for a long time,"" Adkins told the crowd, pointing to a 1972 research paper by James Anderson.
While AI is very good for launching cyberattacks, it's not necessarily any better than non-AI systems for defense — because it produces too many false positives.
""AI is good at spotting anomalous behavior, but it will also spot 99 other things that people need to go in and check"" out, only to discover it wasn't an attack, says Adkins.
The problem in applying AI to security is that machine learning requires feedback ""to learn what is good and bad ... but we're not sure what good and bad is,"" especially when malicious programs mask their true nature, she said.
When asked what advice she would give to businesses to keep their networks safe, Adkins advised ""more talent ... less technology.""
""Pay some junior engineers and have them do nothing but patch,"" she said.

 Google seems likely to introduce a smaller version of the Google Home next week.
Images of the device first appeared on blog Droid-Life on Tuesday, showing what appears to be a small pebble-shaped speaker with a single wire for plugging into the wall. Three colors appear on the blog, including black, gray and the coral color above.
 Google will reportedly introduce the Google Home Mini during its event on Oct. 4, when it's also expected to introduce its new Pixel 2 smartphones.
The naming seems confirmed, since a dead link on Google's site mentions it specifically by name. Droid-Life said it'll cost $49 and will operate similarly to the full-size Google Home, which lets you check the weather, control smart-home gadgets and more. Given the size, it's likely the speaker quality won't be as good.
Google was not immediately available for comment.

Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google.
 Twitter has added another longtime Google executive to its board of directors: Patrick Pichette, who served as Google's CFO from 2008 until summer of 2015.
Pichette will replace Hugh Johnston, the CFO of Pepsi, who  joined Twitter's board just a little over one year ago. According to a Twitter press release, Johnston has taken a board seat at Microsoft.
Pichette is now the second well-known Google exec to take a seat on Twitter's board. Twitter chairman Omid Kordestani was the search giant's  longtime business boss before he joined Twitter's board as chairman two years ago.
 Bringing on Pichette adds a certain level of intrigue to Twitter's future. Google has long been viewed as a crowd favorite to one day acquire Twitter. Now the social company has two of the search giant's former execs advising the CEO and sitting on the board.
Pichette's term will begin on Dec. 1, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission  filing.
Many on Twitter were quick to point out that Pichette, who just joined the service in February, has never tweeted. Which some may find odd considering he's now going to be advising the company.

 A first look at Nest's new home security system   
 12:42  PM ET Thu, 21 Sept 2017 |  01:56 
 Alphabet's Nest unit, which makes internet-linked home devices, is entering the security-hardware market as it tries to expand beyond its smart-thermostat business. 
 At an event in San Francisco on Wednesday, the company unveiled a variety of products for home security, including a smart doorbell with camera and facial recognition and a home security system consisting of motion-detecting sensors and cameras. The company says it's focused on ease of use.
At the event, Nest CEO Marwan Fawaz forecast that the company will ship more products this year than in last two years combined. ""Security is an industry desperate for innovation,"" Fawaz said. Wired also reported that an unnamed Nest executive said the division would be on a $1 billion ""run rate"" by the end of this year -- meaning it would be on track to book $1 billion in revenue over a 12-month period -- but Nest declined to comment on that figure.
 The first product introduced was a ""smart"" doorbell called Hello that will include a camera and facial recognition to identify visitors. It will ship next year, and Nest did not announce pricing.
 The company also introduced a home security system called Secure, which combines motion detectors, a set of cameras, and a passcode-input device called the Nest Guard. Users can unlock the system by swiping a fob called the Tag over the Guard device.
The motion detector, known as Detect, is able to detect all sorts of motions at both short and long ranges. For instance, if it's placed on a window, it can detect when the window is opened, while if it's in a room it can tell if somebody's moving through that room. Nest claims this sets it apart from other products on the market.
 A Nest executive introduces the Nest Guard, part of the Alphabet subsidiary's new line of home security products.
 The company also announced that its intelligent personal assistant, the Google Assistant, is coming to the indoor camera. That brings Alphabet into more direct competition with the Amazon Echo class of devices, which include Alexa.
The company is promoting these devices as being easy to use, overcoming the traditional view of connected home devices as complicated geeks-only toys. ""Tough on bad guys, easy on you,"" said Nest co-founder Matt Rogers.
Prices vary depending on the combination of products you buy. For instance, the outdoor camera alone is $349, while the complete Secure package with all those products costs $598.
Google acquired Nest for $3.2 billion in cash in early 2014.  Nest co-founder Tony Fadell stepped down in June 2016, after the company failed to quickly refresh its product line, and the former Apple executive faced criticism over an alleged mercurial management style.
Nest named Fawaz, a cable industry veteran, to replace Fadell. This is the first major new product line for Nest since Fawaz took over, although the company did release a less expensive version of its smart thermostat earlier this year.

 Google agrees to buy part of HTC for $1.1 billion   
 8:57  AM ET Thu, 21 Sept 2017 |  00:56 
 Alphabet subsidiary Google announced on Thursday that it signed a $1.1 billion cooperation agreement with Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC to bolster its smartphone and emerging hardware business.
 Under the agreement, Google will acquire a team of approximately 2,000 HTC employees, many of whom have worked with the company on its Pixel smartphone. As part of the transaction, HTC will receive $1.1 billion in cash.
Separately, Google will also receive a non-exclusive license for HTC intellectual property.
 The move formalizes a long-awaited tie-up that could further Google's ambitions in the mobile phone and virtual reality industries and may rescue HTC's flagging business.
""This agreement is a brilliant next step in our longstanding partnership, enabling Google to supercharge their hardware business while ensuring continued innovation within our HTC smartphone and VIVE virtual reality businesses,"" Cher Wang, chairwoman and CEO at HTC, said in a prepared statement.

Members of the media examine Google's Pixel phone during an event to introduce Google hardware products on October 4, 2016 in San Francisco, California.
 In a blog post, Google Senior Vice President of Hardware Rick Osterloh said the agreement will help the tech giant innovate its family of Made by Google products.
Made by Google products, introduced last fall, include its Pixel smartphones, Google Home, Google Wifi, Daydream View virtual reality headset and Chromecast Ultra. The second generation of products are set to be unveiled on October 4, according to the blog post.
""That's why we've signed an agreement with HTC, a leader in consumer electronics, that will fuel even more product innovation in the years ahead,"" Osterloh wrote.
The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. It is expected to close by early 2018.
News of agreement comes after the Taiwan Stock Exchange said HTC's stock had been halted, starting Sept. 21 local time, pending the release of ""material information."" 
Taiwan-based HTC once had as much as 10 percent of the smartphone market, according to estimates from Counterpoint Research. But despite a cult following, HTC's market share has fallen since the end of 2011 to less than 2 percent.
While HTC doubled down in North America and Europe, battling the immense resources of Apple and Samsung, other Chinese brands took hold in emerging markets like India, leaving HTC without a market to fall back to, Counterpoint's Neil Shah wrote in a blog post.
Google, however, has provided a lifeline for HTC over the past few years. HTC built some of Google's Nexus tablets, and Google worked closely with HTC on the manufacturing and assembly of its first-ever end-to-end phone design, the Pixel.
Google has indicated that making its own hardware, from home speakers to phones, will be a continued focus as the company tries to specialize its software for advanced artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Those types of features require powerful phones, and HTC could help Google make them. 
Further, HTC makes the high-end Vive virtual reality system. It's the third-most-popular headset in terms of shipments and market share, according to IDC estimates, which means that it likely has a strong base of app developers that could help Google compete with rivals like Samsung, Sony and Facebook.

Dr. Astro Teller speaks during the Google: Moonshots in Reality forum during the 2015 Tribeca Film Festival at Spring Studio on April 22, 2015 in New York City.
 Many of Google parent company Alphabet's newest innovations come out of its secretive research-and-development company X.
 Ventures at X, which previously was known as Google [X], include global internet access division Project Loon, its self-driving car Waymo, smart glasses Google Glass, and its delivery drone service Project Wing. The company calls itself a ""moonshot factory"" because it works on technologies to solve some of the world's biggest problems.
CNBC spoke with X's ""Captain of Moonshots"" and leader Dr. Astro Teller at the 2017 Goalkeepers event in New York to get updates on X's projects, his thoughts on Silicon Valley's culture and the need for diversity, and what he really thinks of the HBO show ""Silicon Valley."" 
 How can global internet access help the most impoverished people in the world?
When an individual or a group of farmers goes from not having the internet to having the internet, crop yields go up, based on U.N. data. They don't always go up as high as 50 percent, but that's not uncommon. That's an incredible boost in the productivity and livelihood for these people.
If you don't have mobile banking, how are you going to set up and run a business? In lots of places around the world, mobile banking is increasingly the only mechanism for interacting in large cities. We can't ask the developing world to be entrepreneurs. They don't have the basic tools. 
We heard reports X was investing in satellite data and other technologies, but is Project Loon going to be your main mechanism to provide global internet access?
It is right now. The future is uncertain, and I'm not being cute about that. The way that we try to do things is we run experiments. We're right some of the time, and we're wrong most of the time. Having tried a bunch of things, stratosphere balloons was the best way that we can see to try and bring the internet to the 4 billion people in the planet that don't have it.

 A lot of tech companies have their own ""moonshot"" factories or innovation labs. What sets X apart?
I'm not sure we need to set ourselves apart. I've been preaching moonshot taking for long enough and begging other groups to start their own moonshot factories. We're not going to run out of creative ways of solving world problems. If there's another group that you think is a moonshot factory, that's an actively good thing — sincerely.
What would you say would be the point of X?
X's goal is to create new businesses for Alphabet, and we believe that doing good for the world and making thriving businesses for Alphabet are not only not at odds with each other, they're actively well-aligned. The world gets all this benefit, we have a thriving business, and we give that to Alphabet. That seems like a good deal for us, and that seems like a good deal for Alphabet — and a good deal for the world.
 ""We believe that doing good for the world and making thriving businesses for Alphabet are not only not at odds with each other, they're actively well-aligned.""
-Dr. Astro Teller, ""Captain of Moonshots"" at X
 You recently re-acquired Google Glass as an X project. What's next?
The market communicated to us over the last couple of years the place that people are most ready for [Google Glass] is in professional settings. That can be classic office work kind of stuff like a doctor or a nurse. It can be on an oil rig, and it can be anything in between, people who work in warehouses or fixing airplanes. There's an incredible amount of work done around the world where people want access to lots of information. They want to be able to communicate hands-free while they're doing other things. They want to be able to document what they're doing. Google Glass is great for that.
Imagine if I'm working — whether it's on a patient or an airplane — and someone can watch from my perspective what I'm doing and show me how to do it. Maybe I can get a specialist on the line. Maybe I'm an apprentice and people are checking in on me and giving me advice. You couldn't just naturally do that with your phone.
The social issues with Google Glass was a good learning experiment. That turns out, at least for the moment, that's not to be the right place for Glass to grow.

 If you're going the professional route, it seems like it's going to be expensive.
You would have to ask the companies, not us, whether they find it expensive. I think they find it incredibly worth it.
You guys are working on a self-driving car. Do people have anything to fear now that many tasks will be automated?
There are jobs that are going to go away. Lots of new jobs will appear. That's happened every single time new technologies have come on the scene. 
Every time in the past we stepped up our education game, but I think we're really letting our society down this time. We have an education crisis. New jobs will increasingly be for those people who can operate computers and robots. It will mean higher productivity work and probably for many people more interesting work, but only if we get them the training necessary. For the kids who are growing up in this country and for many adults, if we do not address those education issues then there will be something to worry about.
Mark Cuban said he thinks the blue-collar job of the future will be inputting data to help these systems. Do you agree?
I think the blue-collar job of today and maybe for the next 10 to 20 years is programming. It's something that you can do by the time you're 18 to 20 years old. You don't need a full college degree in order to do it. You can get paid very well to do it. Even if there were twice as many programmers in the world as there are today there still would be openings around the world for computer programmers.
What's up with Project Wing, X's delivery drone project?
We're doing some work in Australia right now, but we've done a bunch of tests with NASA and the FAA here in the United States. We're going to continue to do more flights every day, fly longer distances. We're working on everything from the safety of the plane to making it quieter.

 Right now there's this perception of bro culture in the tech industry. Google has dealt with some of these issues recently. Where do you stand on this?
Silicon Valley has a problem. I know that X recognizes the problem. We still have work to do at X, but I think we're better than a lot of Silicon Valley. And we're continuing to work on it. I would like to think all of Silicon Valley is working on it.
While Silicon Valley has a bro culture — I'm not saying it does not — Silicon Valley did not invent the machismo work culture. It's everywhere. I think what's interesting is that Silicon Valley and some companies like Alphabet are held to a higher standard. We're working incredibly hard to live up on a whole bunch of fronts. I think Alphabet is doing pretty well. I hope that Silicon Valley can end up being a good example of how to fix this problem.
 ""Silicon Valley has a (bro culture) problem.... We still have work to do at X, but I think we're better than a lot of Silicon Valley. And we're continuing to work on it. I would like to think all of Silicon Valley is working on it.""
-Dr. Astro Teller, leader of Alphabet's X
 How is X more advanced when it comes to addressing gender inequality in the workplace?
I'm probably the wrong person to ask. You should ask some of the women at X, but I would like to think we are very focused on diversity.
If you are building a moonshot factory, the first thing you would be obsessed with is getting diverse perspectives in the building. That's not code just for gender or color of skin, but I want you to think different from me. If you think the same as me, how are we going to find creative new solutions? Sometimes that means ""Let's make sure we have lots of women as well as men, that we have people from different ethnic backgrounds."" It also means like, ""Hey there are no veterans in this conversation."" Or ""Look, this entire team doesn't have but two people on it that grew up outside the United States. That's not okay.""
I know a lot of the public's perception of Silicon Valley has been influenced by the HBO show ""Silicon Valley."" Is it accurate?
You know that's satire, right? It's a joke. Obviously Silicon Valley overall is not like that show. At the same time, that show is funny because there's important kernels of truth in it. It's an exaggeration, a caricature of Silicon Valley. That's sort of like saying ""Ally McBeal"" is an accurate representation of a law firm. At the same time, you might learn something about a law firm by watching ""Ally McBeal."" You may at least pick up some of the buzzwords, jokes or tensions that may happen around Silicon Valley if you watch the show.
There was a report you were working with the ""Silicon Valley"" showrunners and had a disagreement. Is that true? (Note: The New Yorker wrote in a profile of showrunners Mike Judge and Alec Berg that Teller angrily rollerbladed out of a meeting with them because he felt they were making fun of the work X was doing.)
I was working with the writers. I did not have a disagreement with them. I think there was somebody who was cranky, but we're very friendly. (Teller has been on advertisements for the show, including an April Fools' Day video.)
 Where do we still need innovation in the tech space?
I don't think we need any innovation in the tech space. The world doesn't need technology. The world needs to have its problems solved. I think the best parts of Silicon Valley are people who are obsessed with solving the problems not obsessed with making technology. There's so many problems: internet access; logistics and delivery of goods — the Wing project; solving for a whole range of transportation issues — this is Waymo. These all describe themselves by the problem they are solving. Loon isn't a balloon project. It's an access project. It just happens to be using balloons.

 });Billionaire tech titan Elon Musk says the global race for artificial intelligence will cause World War IIIand that governments will take the technology ""at gunpoint"" if necessary. The Tesla and SpaceX chief has said robots will be able to do everything better than humans can. And he has said ""AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization"" that poses ""vastly more risk"" than North Korea.
 The dire warnings have gotten a tremendous amount of attention. As one of the most high-profile entrepreneurs in the country, his words hold weight for many. When Musk tweets, people pay attention.
And yet, predictions about a dangerous future with artificial intelligence are grossly unhelpful, according to John Giannandrea, the senior vice president of engineering at Google, who is in charge of the tech giant's AI efforts.
 ""I just object to the hype and the sort of sound bites that some people have been making,"" says Giannandrea, speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt SF  on Tuesday. ""I am definitely not worried about the AI apocalypse.""
 The Google exec did not mention Musk by name, though the Silicon Valley titan's predictions have been frequent and some of the most severe. But Giannandrea says such fear-mongering is based on too many assumptions.

 });
 ""There is just a huge amount of unwarranted hype around AI right now,"" said Giannandrea. ""Machine learning and artificial intelligence is extremely important and will revolutionize many vertical industries, and I am very excited by the progress we are making, but it is very practical and applied progress. And I think what we are doing is building tools, like, say, the Google Search engine, that make you more productive.
""This leap into — somebody is going to build a superhuman intelligence and then there is going to be all these ethical issues — is unwarranted and borderline irresponsible because people who don't understand the technology get very concerned rather than focusing on the positive effects.""
 ""I am definitely not worried about the AI apocalypse.""
-John Giannandrea, Google's AI chief
 And Giannandrea believes that there is significant benefit to human productivity and potential with artificial intelligence.
""Computers are incredibly powerful but they are also pretty dumb, and I think we need to work hard to make them fulfill the potential that they have and so that means teaching them to be smarter,"" Giannandrea says. ""Technology should augment the human intellect not replace it. It should be a powerful tool to help us think better, and I think that is really the journey we are on.""
Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is also optimistic about the future of AI and has similarly chastised dire warnings about a scary future.

 Elon Musk issues yet another warning against runaway artificial intelligence   
 1:37  PM ET Mon, 17 July 2017 |  01:03 
 That optimistic view of the potential of AI is driving Google's plans for the future: CEO Sundar Pichai has called for Google to be an ""AI-first"" company, according to Giannandrea. Google will increasingly build products that depend on AI technology.
In the future, Giannandrea expects a world of ""pervasive computing,"" meaning that instead of carrying around computing power in our pocket in the form of a smartphone, it will be built into the infrastructure all around us. And that pervasive computing will be personalized. Google Home, a voice-activated speaker assistant, is a harbinger of what is to come, says Giannandrea.
While tech behemoths are aggressively pursuing AI, Giannandrea says it is a space ripe with opportunity for individual entrepreneurs. Google makes much of its research and data available publicly for engineers to access and build off of.
""For the start-up community this is a super exciting time,"" says Giannandrea. Investors are especially interested in dumping venture capital dollars into health-care start-ups, he has observed.
The AI chief is excited to see computers get to the point where they can process and analyze written language.
""One of the most exciting research areas for me is in language understanding. I think that is kind of the holy grail for applied artificial intelligence. We are surrounded by documents and websites and news articles, literally hundreds of thousands published every minute, and the question is how to make sense of all this data,"" says Giannandrea. ""Today, computers can't 'read' in the sense of read and understand and summarize a document, and so I think progress in that area is one that I am really excited about.""

Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA)
 A congressional investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election — and the way in which Kremlin-aligned forces may have pursued their efforts on social media — is already expanding  beyond early scrutiny of Facebook.
For Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on his chamber's intelligence committee, there are fresh fears about the extent to which Russian agents may have tapped bots to amplify their message on other websites like Twitter, he told Recode on Wednesday. To that end, Twitter is set to brief staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is leading the probe, next week.
""Just as the case with Facebook ... I think the Russians actively used Twitter accounts,"" Warner explained. ""They don't screen out as much anonymous or fake accounts, but I feel like it's important to let them come in and make that presentation first.""
 Warner is also concerned as to what role, if any, other websites like Reddit may have played in spreading misinformation, his office confirmed, after hearing from security experts about misinformation spread there. And earlier this spring, the Virginia Democrat had briefings from Google, a spokeswoman confirmed. Even now, the Virginia Democrat told Recode, he remains troubled by the way in which Google displayed search results related to the 2016 election.
""I would point out that, you know, back around the election time, if you were to Google election hacking, most of the stories that came up were Russian-based,"" Warner said. ""That raises a question to me — why wasn't Fox or MSNBC higher on that list?""
The flurry of tough, uncomfortable questions for these tech giants presages what might be a tough public grilling before the intelligence committee as soon as next month. Warner  said his goal is to hold a hearing in October, and the panel's leader, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, seems to agree. But Burr has not formally set a date, nor have companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter received official requests to testify.
Asked if the panel might soon demand that the chief executives of tech giants like Facebook appear before Congress, Warner replied to Recode: ""TBD.""
The Senate probe is one of two efforts by lawmakers to study suspected Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Warner's counterpart on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, similarly told Recode in an interview this week that he would like to see tech giants including Facebook explain themselves to congressional investigators.
""To a frightening degree, we see a growth in the use of malicious bots to try to sway public opinion,"" Schiff said. ""It's not confined to Russia, and in some cases it's very human-driven as well as bot-driven.""
At a hearing, Schiff said, lawmakers would certainly have myriad questions — like ""what can [tech] tell us about the after-effects of the advertisements they have identified, the downstream consequences that may have been unleashed by it.""
There's a ""great deal more we need to know,"" the Democratic lawmaker continued, ""and a great deal more the tech companies themselves need to know.""
Spokespeople for Facebook, Google and Reddit did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Twitter, meanwhile, acknowledged it would be visiting Capitol Hill next week. ""Twitter engages with governments around the world on public policy issues of importance and of interest to policymakers,"" a spokeswoman said, adding that the company would ""will continue to strengthen our platform against bots and other forms of manipulation.""
For now, those companies have largely kept quiet about potential Russian interference on their platforms, not least because a more formal federal investigation, led by former FBI Director Robert Mueller, is well under way. Facebook has acknowledged that it found ""about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies,"" which bought roughly 3,000 Facebook ads between June 2015 and May 2017. Those pages were ""likely operated out of Russia,"" the social giant said at the time.
Despite those disclosures, Warner told Recode that he remains frustrated with Facebook.
""I just wonder, a company that prides itself on data, knowledge of all of us. I find it hard to believe it's taken this long. Maybe they've not put their resources behind this,"" Warner said.
""It was reported to me they didn't even run those same accounts"" — those who used credit cards to purchase the 100,000 ads in rubels — to see if they ""paid for certain things in dollars in different areas,"" Warner charged.
In the meantime, Warner said he's  eyeing early legislation targeting issue-based and candidate-focused online political advertising, hoping to create ""some repository where the public can go look at that content."" Right now, those ads — spots on Facebook, as well as disappearing content on apps like Snapchat — aren't cached anywhere, even though television stations and newspapers have to retain copies for public inspection.
Schiff said he had pressed Zuckerberg directly on Russian interference. During a meeting with the Facebook chief executive last month, Schiff said they ""had certainly talked about the issue of what the Russians were doing, as well as the broader issues in terms of how people are getting their information now, whether people are exposed to diversity of information or accurate news.""
Still, the Democratic lawmaker would like tech giants to come to Congress anyway. ""I would welcome their coming in to testify, and I hope we can agree on that as a committee,"" he said. ""But I also think all of the techno companies are going to have to make substantial investments in ferreting out the propagation of fake and false stories, the application of that false information, the expanding use of bots and cyborgs and paid social media trolls, because this problem is going to be with us indefinitely.""

 President Donald Trump will issue a new directive Monday to supercharge the U.S. government's support for science, tech, engineering and mathematics, including coding education, three sources familiar with the White House's thinking told Recode.
To start, Trump is set to sign a presidential memorandum at the White House later today that tasks the Department of Education to devote at least $200 million of its grant funds each year to so-called STEM fields, as the administration seeks to train workers for high-demand computer-science jobs of the future.
And on Tuesday, Trump's daughter and advisor, Ivanka, is expected to head to Detroit, where she will join business leaders for an event unveiling a series of private-sector commitments — from Amazon, Facebook, Google, GM, Quicken Loans and others — meant to boost U.S. coding and computer-science classes and programs, the sources said. The exact total of their financial pledges is unclear.
 The new White House emphasis on STEM and computer science amounts to something of a policy coup for the tech industry, which long has implored the U.S. government to prioritize education in those high-demand fields.
In the eyes of Code.org, one of the organizations working with the White House, not even half of U.S. high schools offer computer science classes. To that end,  Apple chief executive Tim Cook urged Trump to make coding a requirement in public schools when he joined the president and other tech leaders at the  White House's so-called ""tech week"" this June.
A month later, Cook and other business leaders, including Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson and Microsoft President Brad Smith, huddled with the Trump administration — including Ivanka — on a private call to discuss ways to rethink federal policy through a tech lens, sources told Recode this week.
But the White House's announcement nonetheless comes at a perilous moment for tech, corporate America and the Trump presidency.

A month ago, scores of executives, including tech giants,  resigned their posts on two councils advising Trump on business and manufacturing issues, citing Trump's early refusal to blame the violence in Charlottesville, Va., on neo-Nazi demonstrators. More recently, the leaders of Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have  openly criticized the president for ending an immigration program known as DACA, which protects children brought to the United States illegally from being deported.
Many of those tech giants are now lobbying the White House and Congress intensely to restore the legal shield for roughly  800,000 beneficiaries, known as Dreamers. And those participating in the White House's computer-science announcement this week could find themselves under immense, new pressure — particularly from their employees — to use the opportunity to continue  trying to advance immigration reform and other, related issues.
Some of the tech giants promising new dollars for coding education came to the table as a result of the Internet Association, the Washington, D.C.-based lobbying voice for the Valley. Other participants include Accenture, Intuit, Salesforce and Pluralsight, an online education company.
Ivanka Trump, for her part, has focused recently on issues like  workforce development. ""By supporting computer science curriculum in our schools, I hope that all children will have the opportunity to become fluent in this language of the future,"" she posted to Instagram in June — along with a photo in which she's sitting with her daughter, Arabella, learning how to code.
But that, too, hasn't come without controversy. Earlier this year, a prominent advocate for more women in tech — Girls Who Code — slammed Ivanka for  being ""complicit"" in advancing Trump's agenda.

Craig Federighi, Senior Vice President Software Engineering speaks during the company's annual world wide developer conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California, U.S. June 5, 2017.
 Google — not Microsoft's Bing — will now be the default for web searches on Siri, iOS, and Macs' ""Spotlight"" function, Apple said on Monday. 
 Search engines such as Google and Bing are monetized through advertisements — which means that the number of eyeballs that view the results is very important. With nearly 15 percent of phones worldwide using iOS, according to IDC, Apple's default search engines represent a sizable audience, even if those users don't always click through to the respective search pages.
Siri's search powers have reportedly oscillated between Google and Bing through the years. TechCrunch previously reported Siri's deal with Google and noted that Bing will still be used to display Siri searches for images. 
 Analysts estimate that Google already pays billions to be the default search engine for iPhones and iPads. Investment firm Bernstein has put the figure at $3 billion, even without Siri, after legal documents revealed that Google paid $1 billion to stay on the iPhone in previous years.

Microsoft, too, has looked to make allies in this arena: Microsoft's Cortana and Amazon's Alexa can now work together.
Apple and Google declined to comment to CNBC on the details of a deal. 
A Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC that in addition to Siri image search,  Bing still powers the aspects of search on Yahoo (Verizon), AOL and Amazon, as well as the multi-lingual abilities of Twitter. 
""We value our relationship with Apple and look forward to continuing to partner with them in many ways, including on Bing Image Search in Siri, to provide the best experience possible for our customers,"" the Microsoft spokesperson said. ""As we move forward, given our work to advance the field of AI, we're confident that Bing will be at the forefront of providing a more intelligent search experience for our customers and partners.""

 Google is reportedly splitting off its shopping service after huge fine   
 1:27  PM ET Tue, 26 Sept 2017 |  00:50 
 Alphabet's Google unit later this week will make its shopping service a stand-alone business within Google's operations and require it to bid against other sites for ad placement at the top of search results, says a person familiar with the company's plans.
 The company will make the change to try and satisfy European antitrust regulators and avoid further fines, said this person, who requested anonymity in exchange for details about the plan. The plan was previously reported by Bloomberg.
The shopping unit would remain part of Google, but would not be integrated with the search business as it is today. The way that shopping ads are displayed may also be slightly redesigned.
 In June, EU regulators fined Google a record 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion), the largest doled out by Brussels for a monopoly abuse case, following a seven-year-long investigation.
Regulators claimed that the company abused its search market dominance to give its Google Shopping service an advantage over other retailers.  
Google, which makes most of its money from advertising, has argued that the European Commission's theory ""just doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online.""
""They reach merchant websites in many different ways: via general search engines, specialist search services, merchant platforms, social media sites, and online ads served by various companies,""  Kent Walker, Google's general counsel, said in a blog post.Europe is continuing to investigate two other charges, including whether the Android mobile operating system is being used to promote other Google products at an unfair disadvantage to rivals.

 Senate Committee to summon Google in Russia probe -Report   
 8:07  PM ET Wed, 27 Sept 2017 |  01:08 
 Senate lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election have asked Facebook, Google and Twitter to testify at a Nov. 1 hearing, a source familiar with the matter told Recode on Wednesday.
The inquiry — to be held by the Senate Intelligence Committee — could subject the three tech giants and their executives to uncomfortable questions about the extent to which Kremlin-backed forces may have used their platforms to spread misinformation, and what those companies might have done differently to stop it.
A spokesman for Facebook confirmed the company had received the invite. Spokespeople for Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.
 House lawmakers, meanwhile, also plan to drag tech companies to the U.S. Capitol in October, they announced Wednesday.
""In the coming month, we will hold an open hearing with representatives from tech companies in order to better understand how Russia used online tools and platforms to sow discord in and influence our election,"" said Reps. Mike Conaway and Adam Schiff, the top Republican and Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, respectively. In their statement, they did not specify a date, or which specific companies they hoped to grill in October.
Lawmakers from both parties have called for a hearing particularly in light of reports that Russian forces purchased 3,000 ads, at a cost of $100,000, on Facebook in the months before the 2016 election. Some of those ads sought to provoke racial, religious and social tensions in the United States, according to sources who have reviewed them.
So far,  Facebook has briefed the committee and its House counterpart on the matter, and Twitter is set to visit Capitol Hill on Thursday to answer lawmakers' questions.  Google briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this year.

 Roku skyrockets on opening day of trading   
 4:04  PM ET Thu, 28 Sept 2017 |  00:54 
 With Roku's 50 percent surge in its market debut, investors are valuing the company more like an internet software and services provider than a maker of a consumer device.
 Roku's $2 billion stock market value, following its opening-day pop, gives the company a price-to-sales ratio of 5.2, according to FactSet. That's a big premium over out-of-favor hardware companies Fitbit and GoPro, which have revenue multiples of 0.9 and 1.2, respectively. Even Apple, the maker of so many iconic devices, is only valued at 3.6 times revenue.
It's taken Roku 15 years and a controversial breakup with Netflix to get to this point, but CEO Anthony Wood finally has investors buying the story that Roku has a unique position in the market. Far beyond a manufacturer of boxes to watch Netflix and Amazon shows, Roku has become a platform for advertisers to reach a large, engaged audience on over 5,000 channels, as well as an operating system that gets built into smart televisions.
 Here's an excerpt from Wood's letter to investors in the IPO prospectus:
 ""I believe that just like mainframe operating systems didn't transition to PCs, and just like PC operating systems didn't make the transition to phones (is your phone powered by Windows?), TVs will be powered by a purpose-built operating system optimized for streaming."" 
The company expects that this year over 150 models of Roku-powered TVs will be available to in North America, an increase from 100 in 2016. Roku is counting on deriving ad revenue tied to content on the platform as well as a cut of subscriptions when consumers sign up for various channels.
All of Roku's growth is in those types of services. In the second quarter, platform sales -- which includes advertising and subscriptions -- almost doubled to $46 million, while sales of Roku streaming players fell 11 percent to $53.7 million.
With that mix of business, Roku is being valued as a hardware and services hybrid, but with optimism that the latter piece will keep expanding. By comparison, Alphabet (which has its own streaming device) is valued at 6.8 times revenue, and Netflix has a price-to-sales multiple of 7.9. Facebook, a pure internet advertising company, trades for 15 times revenue. (All data is from FactSet.)
 #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(""dw-chart"");$(window).on(""orientationchange"",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});});
 There's no guarantee that Roku can sustain this valuation. GoPro surged in its market debut in 2014, as did Fitbit the following year. Both are now trading at less than half their IPO price as they struggle to compete with Apple and a host of companies building on Google's Android platform.
In the risk factors section of its prospectus, the second point Roku makes is that the TV streaming market is highly competitive and includes ""large technology companies."" The company can't succeed if it's just another maker of a popular low-margin device.
""If we fail to differentiate ourselves and compete successfully with these companies,"" the filing says, ""it will be difficult for us to attract users and our business will be harmed.""

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager holds a news conference at EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, July 14, 2016.
 European Union (EU) regulators told CNBC Thursday that it is ""premature"" to make a decision on whether Google's attempt to remedy its antitrust violation on its shopping service is sufficient.
 Google was fined a record 2.4 billion euros ($2.7 billion) in June by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm. It was accused of abusing its market dominance in search ""by giving illegal advantages"" to its shopping service — the shopping results that appear at the top of the Google page when you search for an item.
The company, which is owned by parent Alphabet, had until September 28 to remedy the practices that were deemed anticompetitive.
 On Wednesday, Google announced some concessions. It said price comparison competitors could bid for ad space in the shopping box at the top of the results page. This might mean that other price comparison sites' ads displaying products could appear.
""We're giving comparison shopping services the same opportunity to show shopping ads from merchants on Google's search results pages as we give to Google Shopping,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement.
""Google Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else,"" he said. The changes will go into effect on Thursday and apply only in Europe.""
But the Commission is reserving judgement for now. In a statement to CNBC, a spokesperson for Margrethe Vestager, the EU's Competition Commissioner, said the Commission has taken note of Google's announcement.
""The clear principle set out in the Commission's decision is that Google has to give equal treatment to rival comparison shopping services and its own service — not more, not less. It is up to Google to achieve and implement that equal treatment,"" the spokesperson told CNBC.
""It would be premature at this stage for the Commission to take any definite positions on Google's plans. As Commissioner Vestager said: 'This issue will remain on our desks for some time.'""
The Commission said it will ""closely monitor"" Google's compliance with its decision and the search giant is ""under an obligation"" to keep the organization informed of its actions by submitted reports every four months.

 Wealth managers are helping high net-worth individuals rake in huge and increasing investment returns — and that trend could well continue with the potential entrance of big technology firms into the investment advisory space.
 ""No one knows yet what the future holds. Will Google and Facebook want to come in?"" David Wilson, head of Asia wealth management at financial advisory Capgemini Global Financial Services, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
However, the future of wealth management will ""absolutely be based on artificial intelligence,"" he said. 
 And that's exactly the tech giants' game.
""The depth of data that they have ... their retailing experience, their social experience, and being able to blend that to put very customized propositions in place"" could meet high net-worth individuals' demand for quality wealth advisory, according to Wilson.

Superyachts and other smaller luxury vessels sit moored in the Port de Fontvieille in Monaco, on Monday, May 18, 2015.
 But that does not mean that the sector will be fully automated, he said. While technology can help meet the demand for quality financial advice, high net-worth clients are demanding more than just great returns — and that's where the human touch comes in, according to Wilson.
High net-worth individuals have seen ""astronomical returns"" on portfolios overseen by wealth managers, Wilson said. According to a World Wealth Report by Capgemini this week, asset managers of wealthy clients reaped returns of 24.3 percent on average. In Asia, excluding Japan, those returns were at 33.0 percent.
The magnitude of those returns is surprising even as investors have, at large, profited from the year's global rally, Wilson said. According to the report, over half of high net-worth individuals said they were open to having their wealth managed by big tech firms like Google and Facebook.
Major tech giants have hinted about moving into financial services and some have already moved into the mobile payments space. Facebook was not immediately available for comment when asked about any future plans by CNBC. Google declined to comment.
Despite asset managers' expectation-beating results on investments, high net-worth clients said that they were only ""modestly satisfied"" with the performance of their advisers, Wilson said.
""The big reason, I believe, is the lack of personalization in some instances of the experience,"" he said, adding that the ideal model would be a hybrid that blends ""the best of digital and personalization, with the ability to tap into the human advisor in a more modular way.""

 Russian-bought Facebook ads could have reached millions of voters   
 4:11  PM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 |  00:55 
 Facebook has shared some details about the Russian-operated profiles it discovered on its platform with Google, as the search giant — with the rest of the tech industry — continues to probe the extent to which Kremlin-backed misinformation spread through their websites during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
It is unclear if Google has found any suspicious ads or other content after evaluating Facebook's data, an exchange of intel confirmed to Recode today by three sources familiar with the matter. At the very least, Google's investigation appears to be much broader in scope than a similar one by Twitter, which had  drawn the ire of Congress for appearing to be incomplete.
A Google spokesperson declined to comment for this story, as did a Facebook rep.
 More from Recode:

For now, though, Google is slated to deliver a private briefing to U.S. lawmakers studying Russia's political tactics in the coming weeks, additional sources told Recode. A date does not appear to have been set.
And the search-and-advertising giant has been asked to join Facebook and Twitter at two upcoming hearings in the House and Senate where the industry will face questions — out in the open — about its safeguards against Russian political interference in the future.
Earlier this month, Facebook announced that it  found 470 Russia-driven accounts that had purchased 3,000 ads on its social network. Those ads, sources told Recode at the time, sought to stoke racial, religious and other social tensions in the United States, including around issues like Black Lives Matter and gun control.
Beyond publishing its findings, Facebook shared more granular details with its peers — standard practice for many tech giants, which generally band together to address online threats, such as hackers. With the aid of that information,  Twitter discovered about 200 Kremlin-aligned accountsdirectly tied to some of the profiles Facebook previously identified. None of those suspicious Twitter accounts had purchased sponsored tweets, the company told lawmakers.
Twitter still  drew sharp rebukes from Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of two panels investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. In a press conference, Warner charged that Twitter's internal investigation was ""frankly inadequate,"" as it relied too heavily on the data supplied by Facebook. And Warner and his counterpart on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, both encouraged Twitter to dig deeper.
Google's internal inquiry seems much broader than that, but nevertheless, the stakes are just as high. The company is the dominant search and advertising player in the United States. And a driver of Google's expected  $35 billion in ad revenue in 2017 is politics, as candidates, campaigns and causes increasingly take their messages online.
Otherwise, Google has not commented publicly on any activity it might have discovered on its platforms, nor has it announced any changes to its ad practices.

 Consumers flock to Google to learn about health conditions like cancer, heart disease and diabetes. In recent years, the search engine has been looking for ways to put its growing volume of health data to use.
 Google's News Lab, which is designed to help journalists and researchers use Google tools for storytelling and understanding data, introduced a new tool this week specifically focused on health care and disease.
On the website -- Searching for Health -- the lab developed a series of visualizations to show how health-related internet searches map to the actual spread of disease. For example, Google shows that in geographic areas where searches for cancer, heart disease, stroke and depression are high, so are actual occurrences of those diseases.
 The data also shows trends over time. Google searches for obesity, for instance, have been steadily on the rise for the past decade.
Whether Google's data can have a positive impact on public health and disease control is an open question. The site, a collaboration between Google, design studio Alberto Cairo and research and design firm Schema Design, doesn't make any claims that it will.

Google searches for obesity over time
 Google is clearly tapping into a topic of widespread interest.
Studies have found that more than 80 percent of internet users have searched for a health-related issue online. To ensure that this information is accurate, Google has an active partnership with Mayo Clinic.
Last year, Google updated its catalog of health symptoms by including more detailed descriptions of specific diseases, as well as treatment options and symptoms that might warrant a doctor's visit.

 });Google is hosting a major product event Wednesday in California where it's expected to unveil several new products.The event follows similar ones held recently by Apple and Amazon. Apple showed off new iPhones in September and, just last week, Amazon revealed several new Echo products. Now it's Google's chance to get in on the fun.Two new Google smartphones are expected to be highlights of the event, but here's a look at everything we expect to see thanks to rumors and analyst notes.As I said earlier, I think Google's new smartphones will be the highlight of Google's event. The company is expected to unveil two new devices including the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, which will follow the Pixel and Pixel XL (pictured above) that were launched last year. The devices introduced last year were extremely hard to find in stock, so the hope is Google has bigger plans to sell more units going forward. It's been reported that HTC is building the smaller Google Pixel 2 while LG may have been selected to build the larger Pixel 2 XL. The Pixel 2 may have some sort of squeeze feature that allows you to launch applications or services by squeezing the sides of the phone -- a feature introduced in the HTC U11. I also expect the latest processors from Qualcomm, sharper displays, better cameras and a good deal of discussion about software.Google currently only sells a single smart home assistant called the Google Home. In an effort to compete with Amazon — which just announced several new Echo devices across multiple price points — Google is expected to introduce a smaller and more affordable Google Home Mini (leaked image from the blog Droid-Life pictured below.)If it's anything like Amazon's more affordable Echo Dot, expect the Google Home Mini to have the same features as the Google Home but without the more premium speaker experience.It's also been reported that Google is preparing to launch yet another Pixel-branded Chromebook called the Pixelbook. It would be the third Chromebook released by Google (the first one is pictured above) and will likely highlight any changes coming to Google's Chrome OS operating system.Google's Pixel Chromebooks typically cost more than $1,000 and are targeted at developers and enthusiasts willing to pay that kind of money, especially since most Chromebooks cost around $300 or so. It's possible Google's Pixelbook will cater to the mainstream market, however, which means Google would need to drop the price.Google is also apparently ready to launch a successor to its original Daydream VR headset. It's unclear what exactly will change — especially since the Daydream VR is comfortable, works well and supports a variety of existing Android smartphones. It's possible this model is cheaper, or that it introduces some sort of new optics that improves the user experience.Google introduced and launched Android Oreo for its existing Google Pixel smartphones without much fanfare. I think we'll hear a bit more about the operating system and how well it works with Google hardware when Google talks about the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. The software experience, especially the Google Assistant, was the highlight of both the Google Pixel and Pixel XL when those phones launched last year.Amazon's event last week was chock full of surprises, and it's possible that Google has a few things up its sleeve that haven't leaked yet.

CNBC will be covering the event live on Wednesday so be sure to check back.Iyah Romm, Cityblock CEO
 Sidewalk Labs, the mysterious urban innovation group of Google parent company Alphabet, has spun out a start-up with ambitious plans to rethink health care.
 The startup, known as Cityblock and known internally at Sidewalk as ""CareLab,"" is focusing on low-income communities with serious health problems. 
Little has been known about Sidewalk's health plans until Cityblock published a web site on Monday detailing its plans.
 Cityblock was conceived by Iyah Romm, Sidewalk's former entrepreneur-in-residence. Romm's LinkedIn profile says he's been leading CareLab since May, and that the spinout of Cityblock happened in October.
Under Cityblock's vision, each member will receive a ""personalized care team"", which includes doctors, coaches, technology tools, follow-up nudges and a health plan. Members can also join a ""neighborhood health hub"" to drop in to connect with this care team.
These services will be offered at no additional cost for those who are covered by insurance. The site says the company is working to forge partnerships with insurance companies to make this happen.
The idea behind Cityblock is that that preventative care costs a lot less than a typical doctor's visit. But in the U.S., far more is spent on medical care than on social services. Researchers have found that's a big reason why health costs continue to rise with little evidence of better outcomes.
""It is imperative that we fundamentally overhaul the system and redouble our efforts to design, test, and deploy impactful care delivery models and digital products,"" wrote Romm in a Medium post. 
""Nearly all innovation efforts have been focused on people with means,"" the site reads. 
The team includes technologists from Google as well as those from the traditional health care system. 
 The plan to focus on health care for lower-income Americans is unusual in Silicon Valley. One of Sidewalk Labs original founders, Adrian Aoun, quit to start Forward, a primary care group based in San Francisco that charges $149 a month out-of-pocket (although the company does offer some free memberships to low-income individuals). 
The Cityblock service isn't planning to launch to members until early 2018.

 ""I had moved a bunch of times and it was just agonizing,"" Ramsey tells CNBC Make It. She had to spend hours trying to find a good deal on real estate sites and then also had to pay an astronomical broker fee.
""I have no problem with an amazing service that costs a lot of money, but the thing that gets to me is low service and a ton of money,"" she says. ""The process where you've already done all the research, you know exactly what apartment you want and you still pay the broker $5,000 or so — that's a broken system.""

 A couple of years ago, Ramsey found an apartment through a friend and the process was seamless: ""I didn't have to pay any sort of owner or broker's fee. She put me directly in touch with her landlord and I took the apartment on the spot because I felt lucky to have a process that was so much less painful than the status quo.

 That's where Joinery comes in. Ramsey and friend Vianney Brandicourt, 33, co-founded it in 2015. At the time, Ramsey had been working at Google for seven years. Brandicourt had left Google by then and was the senior product analyst at Foursquare.
""We both had amazing jobs,"" says Ramsey, who originally met Brandicourt at Google. ""But the start-up world is so competitive and it's pretty impossible to do it part-time. In order to give things [at Joinery] a chance, we really felt like we had to take the plunge and just go for it.""

 Joinery, which is currently available only in New York City, connects apartment hunters with tenants who are moving out.
If you're moving in, you can browse the site for listings, schedule viewings with departing tenants and move in without paying a steep broker fee. The most you'll pay to the outgoing tenant is half a month's rent. That's not bad, considering  the typical broker's fee is 15 percent of a year's rent. 
Since the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City is $3,680 a month, a 15 percent broker fee on a typical one-bed would cost you $6,624. That's especially significant given that 61 percent of older millennials, those aged 25 to 34, have less than $1,000 in their savings accounts and 41 percent have nothing at all. 
""Your median New Yorker is already spending 65 percent of their income on rent, which is staggering,"" says Ramsey. ""Not to say that this company is going to magically get rid of that burden, but we can mitigate that somewhat by not having people spend thousands every time they have to move. When you add that broker fee on top of all of your housing costs, it's a lot. It really is a tax on moving. It's a tax on your freedom to live in places that you want to.""
 ""When you add that broker fee on top of all of your housing costs, it's a lot. It really is a tax on moving.""
-Julia Ramsey, co-founder and CEO of Joinery
 There's incentive to list your apartment on Joinery too: If you fill the space, you get paid.
""There's a price ceiling,"" Ramsey explains of Joinery's service fee. ""We didn't accidentally want to replicate the astronomical cost of brokerage. The model is flexible: If you're moving out of your apartment, you can charge up to half a month's rent. A lot of folks charge a couple hundred bucks.""
Joinery earns money by taking a 20 percent commission on top of whatever the tenant chooses to charge, says Ramsey: ""It's proportional to the cost you're paying.""
Since leaving Google a year and a half ago, ""my day-to-day is completely different,"" says Ramsey, ""and challenging in a very different way than my job at Google was.""

 There are certain things you don't necessarily think of when starting a company, the CEO says, like health insurance: ""Going from the cadillac of health insurance at Google to having to navigate our healthcare system was shocking and really eye-opening.""
Plus, legal costs were ""also shockingly high,"" she says. ""You have to think about the costs of incorporating, negotiating term sheets, filing trademarks and the like.""
Her top advice for aspiring entrepreneurs: Save big before starting.
""I would recommend calculating and saving for two years or so of expenses,"" Ramsey tells CNBC Make It. ""The amount you can save will greatly affect your odds of success.""

 });Bose's new QuietComfort 35 II — best known as the QC 35II — are the best Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones you can buy right now.The QC35 II headphones follow in the footsteps of the very popular Bose QC35 set, which has received almost universal praise from consumers who sought noise canceling and Bluetooth in the same package. They weren't cheap, and neither are the $349 QC35 II headphones. They're worth it if you travel, though.Better yet, the new model is the first set of headphones built with official support for Google Assistant, which means you can ask any sort of question — like the Yankees score or Apple's stock price — just by tapping a button.The actual headphones haven't changed much since last year. The design and fit feel almost the same (I'm a proud owner of the originals). There's still a micro-USB port for charging, and I wish Bose had updated this to the more common USB-C standard used in most consumer electronics. The volume and power buttons are within easy reach, and the cups are nice and comfortable even after hours of use.Oh, and if you still like using the 3.5mm headphone jack, you can. Bose provides a 2.5mm to 3.5mm jack in the included carrying case that you can use at any time, including if the headset's battery dies.There's also a new Google Assistant button for pulling up the virtual assistant, which we'll discuss now.I didn't think I'd care much to have Google built in to a set of headphones, but it works really well. You'll first need to install and sign in to the Google Assistant app on Android or iPhone, which takes a few seconds to do. After you've done that, a quick tap of the button pulls up Google for all sorts of tasks. You can ask the assistant to remind you of something, play specific music, start a movie on your phone and more.The function is brilliant and, while I haven't flown with them just yet, I can imagine it's much easier than fumbling with an iPad in a cramped airline seat. There are other uses, too.You can ask Google to play the news and hear highlights, set a timer, find nearby restaurants if you're walking around town, ask for a breakdown of your day and more. Google worked really well during my tests, accurately understanding what I was asking.The Bose QC 35 II headphones sound about the same as last year's model, at least in my test, so the major change really just comes down to the built-in Google Assistant and adjustable noise cancellation settings. The latter allows you to tweak how much noise cancellation is coming through, so you can leave some background noise in case you want to be able to hear the flight attendant as she walks down the aisle with dinner, or hear a colleague at work.The audio sounds great to me, which is why I still adore my original set of Bose headphones, although I know some audiophiles squirm at the very mention of the Bose brand. Still, for great sound and solid noise canceling, I haven't found anything that comes close to the Bose QC 35 or Bose QC 35 II headphones.I'm torn.

The volume and power buttons are within easy reach, and the cups are nice and comfortable even after hours of use.Oh, and if you still like using the 3.5mm headphone jack, you can.

You'll first need to install and sign in to the Google Assistant app on Android or iPhone, which takes a few seconds to do.

You can ask the assistant to remind you of something, play specific music, start a movie on your phone and more.The function is brilliant and, while I haven't flown with them just yet, I can imagine it's much easier than fumbling with an iPad in a cramped airline seat. There are other uses, too.You can ask Google to play the news and hear highlights, set a timer, find nearby restaurants if you're walking around town, ask for a breakdown of your day and more. Google worked really well during my tests, accurately understanding what I was asking.The Bose QC 35 II headphones sound about the same as last year's model, at least in my test, so the major change really just comes down to the built-in Google Assistant and adjustable noise cancellation settings. The latter allows you to tweak how much noise cancellation is coming through, so you can leave some background noise in case you want to be able to hear the flight attendant as she walks down the aisle with dinner, or hear a colleague at work.The audio sounds great to me, which is why I still adore my original set of Bose headphones, although I know some audiophiles squirm at the very mention of the Bose brand.

 Oath, the new digital advertising and media company that combines AOL and Yahoo, has a monstrous challenge ahead.
 Google and Facebook control almost two-thirds of the online ad market, according to eMarketer. Verizon -- the parent of Oath -- is stuck below 5 percent and in a tie for third with Microsoft.
Beyond trying to track down two of the world's most valuable companies, Oath has to overcome Yahoo's recent data breaches, which further damaged an already troubled reputation. Yahoo's platform has also been accused of high levels of ad fraud by its customers, with sources previously telling CNBC that ads didn't run in the right place and many of the viewers were actually bots.
 But Oath is talking a big game. 
By merging its disparate ad platforms and expanding its media properties in Latin America, Asia and Europe, the company plans to double its reach to 2 billion people in the next three to five years. It's also working with third parties to provide more transparency in telling marketers where their ads are running.
John DeVine, Oath's chief revenue officer, expects those efforts to result in major market share gains.
""We want to move the ball forward around the theme of trust, and we don't want to stop at number three,"" DeVine told CNBC.

 Tim Armstrong takes 'Oath' of office as CEO   
 7:57  AM ET Wed, 14 June 2017 |  01:22 
 Oath recently launched its first global advertising campaign called #BuildYourBrand to reintroduce AOL and Yahoo as one company to advertisers and the public. The companies were acquired by Verizon in 2015 and 2017, respectively.
In aiming to reach more of the projected 5 billion internet users worldwide by 2020, Oath is emphasizing mobile experiences, DeVine said. It's focusing on sports, news and finance coverage and going heavy on original video, especially sports and live events. Verizon had the exclusive rights to the first London NFL game this September. The company plans to acquire more concerts and international sports and is evaluating the rights to cricket matches.
Tim Mahlman, Oath's president and head of programmatic ad tech platforms, said there's also an opportunity to provide production facilities and license syndicated video to Oath's media partners.
""We have the tools between our two companies that allow us to take video content and expand it out to where it isn't today,"" Mahlman said.
As for the data breaches, DeVine called it an ""industry problem"" and pointed to the latest hack involving Equifax. He said that following Yahoo's two major hacks last year, the company was able to rebuild its relationships with users rather quickly.
""We're all going to continue to fight this together,"" DeVine said. ""We feel like were on a very good trust footing with our consumers, and we're going to continue to earn that every day.""

 Tech's four horsemen more like Darth Vader or Ayn Rand: NYU's Scott Galloway   
 9:17  AM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  01:22 
 The following is an excerpt from ""The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google"" (Oct. 3, 2017, Portfolio) by Scott Galloway:
 Firms try to build higher and higher walls to keep enemies (upstarts and competitors) from invasion. Business theorists call these structures ""barriers to entry.""
They are nice in theory, but increasingly traditional walls are showing cracks, even crumbling — especially in tech. The plummeting price of processing power (Moore's Law again), coupled with an increase in bandwidth and a new generation of leadership that has digital in their DNA, has produced bigger ladders than anyone ever expected. ESPN, J.Crew, and Jeb Bush . . . all unassailable, no? No. Digital ladders (over-the-top video, fast fashion, and @therealdonaldtrump) can vault almost any wall.
 So, what's a ridiculously successful firm to do? Malcolm Gladwell, the Jesus of business books, highlights the parable of David & Goliath to make the key point: don't fight on other people's terms. In other words, once you've made the jump to light speed as a tech firm, you need to immunize yourself from the same conquering weapons your own army levied on the befuddled prey. There are several obvious examples: network effects (everyone is on Facebook because . . . everyone's on Facebook); IP protection (every firm in tech over $10 billion is suing, and being sued by, every other $10 billion tech firm), and developing an industry standard—monopoly—ecosystem (typing this on Word because I have no choice).
However, I'd argue that digging deeper moats is the real key to long-term success.
The iPhone will not be the best phone for long. Too many firms are struggling to catch up. However, there is a key asset of Apple Inc. that has a stronger immune system: its 492 retail stores in 19 countries. Wait, a marauder could just put up an online store, no? No. HP.com vs. the Apple Regent Street Store in London is like bringing a (butter) knife to a gunfight. And even if Samsung decides to allocate the capital, nine women can't have a baby in a month and the Korean giant would need a decade (at least) to present a similar offering.
Brick and mortar's troubles have been laid at the feet of digital disruption. There is some truth to that. However, digital sales are still only 10–12 percent of retail. It's not stores that are dying, but the middle class, and the stores serving them. Most that are located in, or serving, middle-class households are struggling. By comparison, stores in affluent neighborhoods are holding strong. The middle class used to be 61 percent of Americans, now they are the minority, representing less than half the population . . . the rest being lower or upper income.
 So, Apple, recognizing that ladders will keep getting taller, opted for more analog (time/ capital expensive) moats. Google and Samsung are both coming for Apple. But they are more likely to produce a better phone than to replicate the romance, connection, and general awesomeness of Apple's stores. So, every successful firm in the digital age needs to ask: In addition to big, tall walls, where can I build deep moats? That is, old-economy barriers that are expensive and take a long time to dredge (and for competitors to cross). Apple has done this superbly, continually investing in the world's best brand, and in stores. Amazon, also is going for moats, erecting a hundred-plus expensive and slow‑to‑get-built warehouses. How old economy! A good bet is Amazon will open thousands before they are done.
Recently Amazon announced leases on twenty 767s and purchased thousands of Amazon-branded tractor-trailers. Google has server farms, and is launching early twentieth-century aviation technology (blimps) into the atmosphere that will beam broadband down to Earth. Facebook, among the Four Horsemen, has the fewest old-economy moats, making it the most vulnerable to an invading army with big-ass ladders. You can expect that to change as Facebook announced they, along with Microsoft, are laying cable across the floor of the Atlantic.
The success of single companies like Apple can hollow out entire markets, even regions. The iPhone debuted in 2007, and devastated Motorola and Nokia. Together they have shed 100,000 jobs. Nokia, at its peak, represented 30 percent of Finland's GDP and paid almost a quarter of all of that country's corporate taxes. Russia may have rolled tanks into Finland in 1939, but Apple's 2007 commercial invasion also levied substantial economic damage. Nokia's fall pummeled the entire economy of Finland. The firm's share of the stock market has shrunk from 70 to 13 percent.

People stand behind police barrier tape outside the Luxor hotel Obelisk and the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, following a mass shooting at the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas, Nevada, October 2, 2017.
 Facebook and Google are facing fresh criticism for failing to hold back the tide of fake news online, as the aftermath of the mass shooting in Las Vegas once again revealed shortcomings in their algorithms.
Early on Monday the two leading online media companies helped showcase inaccurate reports that wrongly identified a man with strong leftwing leanings as being connected to the killings. The reports circulated on rightwing news sites before slipping through the automated filters used by Facebook and Google.
 Both companies said the problems were short-lived and they were working to fix the failures but not before exposing themselves to a new round of criticism for not doing enough to prevent the spread of false and damaging information.
“There’s a way — the fact is, they don’t have the will,” said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University and author of The Four, a new book about Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. He said the recent hiring of more staff to identify and remove false information was too limited to have an effect: “It’s pi**ing in the ocean — it’s a series of half measures.”
For Facebook, already under intense political pressure over the use of its network by Russian operatives during the US election, the latest slip has come at a difficult time. The misinformation, spread by a site called Alt-Right, appeared on Facebook’s “Safety Check” page, which people use to make sure their friends and family are safe after a crisis.
Facebook said the offending post was spotted by its global security operations centre but that “its removal was delayed by a few minutes”. In that time, it added, the post was “screen-captured and circulated online”.
The social networking company did not explain how its algorithms had allowed the fake information to be posted. “We are working to fix the issue that allowed this to happen in the first place and deeply regret the confusion this caused,” it said.
In Google’s case, a search for the name of the man wrongly accused of the shootings brought up a page of search results topped by three prominent boxes labelled “Top Stories”. One of these was a post from 4Chan, a site known for its online hoaxes and misinformation, which contained the false claim.
Google’s Top Stories are drawn both from its News service, which has some degree of curation, and from a general web search. The 4Chan result was drawn from the web.
While Facebook manually removed its post, Google said the 4Chan post was “algorithmically replaced”, and that this had taken “hours” from the time it first appeared. To protect itself from accusations of subjectively favouring some search results over others, Google relies on the weight of “good information” to drive out the bad from its results, or making changes to its algorithms that affect all searches equally.
“This should not have appeared for any queries and we’ll continue to make algorithmic improvements to prevent this from happening in the future,” Google said.
Meanwhile, Twitter also came under fire on Monday after a user posted a screenshot of a search that returned a result from Infowars, a site frequently criticised for peddling conspiracy theories, as the top result. The post reported a claim from militant Islamist group Isis that it was behind the Las Vegas shootings.
Though Isis had made the claim, reporting its statement without pointing out that it was unsubstantiated was seriously misleading for readers, said Dan Gillmor, a digital media expert who teaches at Arizona State University. “If a responsible news organisation is going to mention it, it should be in context,” he said.
Twitter was unable to say how many users saw the search result, but said the personalisation in its system meant that people who searched for the same thing often saw different results.

 We are letting Amazon and Apple 'avoid taxes, invade privacy, and destroy jobs,' says NYU professor   
 1:32  PM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  00:46 
 Scott Galloway is one angry guy.  He's a professor at the NYU Stern School of Business, where he teaches brand strategy and digital marketing, and he's the founder of consulting firm L2. Galloway has become a bit of a media star recently on his (accurate) prediction that Amazon should consider buying Whole Foods.  You might think his new book, ""The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google,"" out Tuesday, would be an admiring examination of how these companies came to dominate the world.  On one level, it is. He explains how the tech giants have succeeded in exerting influence over our attention, our loyalty and our personal information.  ""Facebook and Google own media; Apple owns the phone; and Amazon is about to molest the entire retail ecosystem,"" he says.  Fair enough, but that's not really what Galloway has set out to do. Galloway is upset, really upset, at what he says these companies are getting away with: ""These companies avoid taxes, invade privacy and destroy jobs to increase profits because ... they can.""  He's angry that the ""Four Horsemen"" — as he calls them — employ only 418,000 employees, about the population of Minneapolis, but they have a combined stock market value ($2.3 trillion) that is roughly the GDP of France, a developed nation of 67 million citizens.  He's angry that these companies create growth without prosperity. He knows that many people tend to blame global trade and immigrants for our problems, but he insists the tech economy and its ""fetishization"" is equally to blame: ""It's dangerous for our society, and it shows no signs of slowing down. It hollows out the middle class, which leads to bankrupt towns, feeds the angry politics of those who feel cheated, and underpins the rise of demagogues.""  It's not just that he doesn't like what these companies are doing. He also doesn't particularly like a lot of the people who run these companies. Doubt me? Here's a sample:  On the obsession with Apple founder Steve Jobs: ""Steve Jobs, in my view, spat on the universe. ... The world needs more homes with engaged parents, not a better ... phone.""  On Apple's tax history: ""Apple is the largest tax avoider in the history of U.S. business.""  On the parallels between Google and Microsoft: ""Microsoft at its peak was notorious for having the most insufferable a------ employees in American business.""  On why rich people are easier to sell to because they're all basically alike: ""Rich people are more homogenous than any other cohort on Earth. ... The global elite, by contrast, is a rainbow of the same damn color."" On what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos should really be doing with his company: ""What's clear is that we need business leaders who envision, and enact, a future with more jobs — not billionaires who want the government to fund, with taxes they avoid, social programs for people to sit on their couches and watch Netflix all day."" Gee, thanks Scott. What is this? New Progressive? Intellectual Populism? Old-fashioned trust busting? Trump-era name calling?
 Amazon declined comment on Galloway's book. Apple did not immediately return a call for comment.  In a phone interview, Galloway describes himself as an ""irreverent progressive,"" telling me, ""I'm a capitalist, but I'm smart enough to realize that idolatry of these firms are not going to take care of us when we are old. They are just here to make a profit. ""  And what's wrong with that? Nothing, he insists, but then goes on: ""We reward them with characteristics associated with kindness and generosity,"" none of which is true, he says. ""They are being given the mother of all hall passes. We think these companies are progressive, when their behavior is more like Darth Vader crossed with Ayn Rand.""  Galloway is seizing on a new zeitgeist that is starting to emerge, a new narrative about these companies, one that switches from gushing admiration to a more critical viewpoint of their impact on the rest of the world, what exactly we have all given up to them, and what we have really received in return.  Do they deserve such criticism? Galloway argues that their sheer size and influence demands that we be more critical toward them. Let's just focus on Amazon for the moment. He is amazed at:  1) The trust Amazon's consumer shows toward Amazon: ""Amazon's customers trust it so much that they're allowing the company to listen in on their conversations and harvest their consumption data. This will give Amazon deeper penetration into the private lives and desires of consumers than any other company.""  2) The way Wall Street gives a pass to Amazon: ""Amazon has trained the Street to hold them to a different standard — to expect higher growth but lower profits.""  3) The stunning success of Amazon Prime: ""Prime members represent recurring revenue, loyalty and annual purchases that are 40 percent greater than non-Prime members.""  4) How Amazon has made shipping the pillar of its success: ""In 2015, Amazon spent $7 billion on shipping fees, a net shipping loss of $5 billion, and overall profits of $2.4 billion. Crazy, no?""  Not crazy, of course. A critical key to Amazon's success was the development of the world's most efficient physical distribution network. Lower costs, greater selection, faster delivery. Get to more and more households in less and less time.  Galloway's conclusion: Amazon is on a path to a trillion-dollar market cap (currently at $460 billion), through a combination of acquisitions, a further push into the last-mile delivery chain and opening more stores. Galloway spends considerable time explaining this oddity, why Amazon, the store killer, will expand into bricks and mortar: ""Because e-commerce doesn't work, isn't economically viable, and no pure e-commerce firm will survive long term.""  What's Amazon's next move? Galloway got considerable buzz a short while ago when he suggested that Nordstrom would be a logical acquisition (they are in talks to go private). But he suggests they are so big they could buy almost anything: ""My bet is Amazon buys the rights to broadcast March Madness or the Super Bowl to juice their Prime membership ... as they can.""  The real move to get them to a $1 trillion market cap, Galloway predicts, will be in artificial intelligence: ""If Amazon tests an AI-like offering anticipating all your retail needs — sending stuff automatically and calibrating based on what you send back or edit via voice ... the stock will become antigravity matter and triple to a trillion dollars in value.""  What about the competition? Is it all over for retail? No, Galloway says. He cites a small group of innovators — Sephora, Home Depot, Best Buy — that are investing in people and a strong in-store experience.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai
 Google CEO Sundar Pichai said his company should be held accountable for combating the spread of fake news.
 ""I view it as a big responsibility to get it right,"" Pichai told the Verge in an interview published Wednesday. ""I think we'll be able to do these things better over time. But I think the answer to your question, the short answer and the only answer, is we feel huge responsibility.""
Google was criticized earlier this week for failing to weed out fake news following the Las Vegas shooting that left 59 dead and over 500 injured. In the hours immediately following the tragedy, a 4Chan article naming the wrong suspect appeared in Google search results.
 ""Today, we overwhelmingly get it right,"" Pichai said. Every time we make a mistake, ""I feel the pain, and I think we should be held accountable,"" he said.
Internet giants like Google, Facebook and Twitter have come under pressure recently to crack down on fake news after Russian groups tried to influence last year's U.S. election. Some have started calling for greater regulation. 
The Verge interview follows a series of product releases by Google.

GoPro Hero 6 Black
 On Wednesday GoPro stock dipped in midday trading after Google revealed a new clip-on camera, Google Clips, and improved cameras in its forthcoming Pixel 2 and Pixel 2XL smartphones. 
 Clips is a new concept for a camera: It automatically takes photos as you go throughout your day. An artificial intelligence engine inside looks for smiles, people you care about, dogs chasing their tails, and automatically captures the moment. Google says it will get smarter over time.
Specifically, GoPro stock fell by about 5 percent in midday trading. The stock opened at $11.06 ahead of the Google hardware event.
 Just a week ago GoPro announced its new Hero 6 and Fusion cameras.

Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google Inc., discusses the Google Pixel virtual assistant during a Google product launch event in San Francisco, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Oct. 4 2016.
 In the intensifying battle to have the best voice-powered technology, Google is making its virtual assistant sound more human and less robotic.
 The speech-activated Google Assistant is relying on software from DeepMind, the artificial intelligence research group under Alphabet. The technology now uses a version of DeepMind's WaveNet system for American English and Japanese, according to a blog post published on Wednesday.
It's a timely shift. Two weeks ago Apple released an upgraded version of the Siri virtual assistant, which is available on iPhones, iPads, Macs and other devices. The news also comes as Google introduces new versions of its Pixel smartphones, as well as speakers and earbuds that will let users talk to the Google Assistant.
 The blog, from DeepMind research scientists Aäron van den Oord and Tom Walters and Google speech software engineer Trevor Strohman, said that the Assistant working on WaveNet ""is the first product to launch"" using Google's second-generation AI chip, the tensor processing unit, or TPU. Google also uses graphics cards from Nvidia to train certain AI systems.

 Google acquired DeepMind in 2014, and has used the software to help lower the cost of cooling its data centers.
DeepMind first unveiled WaveNet a year ago, but it was ""too computationally intensive to work in consumer products,"" according to the blog post.

Google Pixelbook
 Only the most hardcore Google fans with plenty of disposable income should consider dropping $999 for Google's new Pixelbook ChromeOS laptop.
 I'm sure it's a nice machine. The Verge called it ""stunning,"" ""well-built,"" and ""beautiful."" Google told the Verge that it's aimed at students who really love the inexpensive Chromebooks they use at school today and want something nicer as they move into their professional lives.
But really, a $999 Chromebook makes sense only for Google's developer base and wealthy enthusiasts.
 First, using a Chromebook is basically like using a Chrome browser with access to Android apps. While native software applications of the type found on Windows and Mac aren't as necessary as they once were, particularly as web versions of apps become more popular and function, you definitely won't find them here.
If you're spending that kind of money, you can buy a full-fledged Windows or macOS laptop that allows you to install full versions of applications, not just Android apps that were intended for a smartphone. Sure, there are some great apps out there that work just fine on a laptop — Netflix, for example — but others just weren't designed for this use case yet. Snapchat is one example; Google said the company is building a special version for Chromebooks.
This isn't a knock against the entire category. I love Chromebooks, including a small Acer Chromebook Flip I picked up a couple of years ago for $299 as a budget travel laptop. They're fine as cost-efficient laptops meant to be deployed in bulk to education and enterprise segments. 
$999, though? No way.

 Google just announced a new phone, computer, home speaker and more   
 3:32  PM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  01:06 
 Alphabet's Google group on Wednesday unveiled a funky new pocket-sized camera called Google Clips that's designed to capture meaningful moments without you needing to click the shutter.
 Like an increasing number of other Google products, the $249 camera relies on artificial intelligence. Whenever it's on, Google Clips is constantly looking out for certain people, facial expressions like smiles, and other indications that it should record footage, Google product manager Juston Payne said at Google's hardware event in San Francisco on Wednesday. The automatic editing capability is reminiscent of the small company Graava's miniature camera.
""It looks for stable, clear shots of people you know, and you help the camera learn who's important to you,"" Payne said. ""And finally, all the machine learning happens on the device itself, so just like any point-and-shoot, nothing leaves your device until you decide to save and share it."" 
 That last part is important — AI tasks can require complex computing, and historically Google has been very reliant on that for AI on mobile devices in particular, but Google has made it possible for Clips to work its magic locally.

 Google debuts a wireless, hands-free camera that pairs with smartphones   
 2:10  PM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  02:00 
 Additionally, a Now Playing feature on the second generation of Google's Pixel smartphones ""detects what song is playing and matches it with tens of thousands of song patterns on your phone"" to quickly identify it without ever reaching out to cloud servers for assistance, Google senior director of product management Sabrina Ellis said at the Google event.
This isn't the first time Google is doing a type of artificial intelligence computation locally on a mobile device. For example, in 2015 Google made it possible for people to automatically translate text that people captured with the cameras on their phones. 
What's notable this time is that Google is positioning Now Playing and the Clips camera as examples of ""on-device machine learning."" Just a few months ago, Apple was talking about that when it introduced Core ML, a system developers can use to make AI models work inside iOS apps, without pinging the cloud. 
Google didn't announce a release date for Clips but did say the product is coming soon. GoPro stock fell after Google revealed Clips.

 Google's new wireless headphones can translate languages on the fly   
 7:30  PM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  00:57 
 Google released a line of new products on Wednesday, including its first pair of premium wireless headphones, which can support live translation between languages. 
 When the Google Pixel Buds are paired with a new handset, the Google Pixel 2, the earbuds can tap into Google Assistant, Google's artificially intelligent voice-activated product. 
In addition to the translation of 40 languages, Google Assistant can also alert users to notifications, send texts and give directions. The translation feature can be conjured by saying ""help me speak French,"" or any other language, according to The Verge, which got a preview of the device.
 The controls, including swiping controls for volume, are built into the right earbud, Google product manager Juston Payne said on stage at the company's event.
""It's an incredible application of Google Translate powered by machine learning — it's like having a personal translator by your side,"" Payne said.

 Google introduces high-end wireless ear buds called Google Pixel Buds   
 3:28  PM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  02:05 
 Payne and another Google employee demonstrated a conversation between someone speaking Swedish and another person responding in English.
During the demonstration, one employee, speaking Swedish, had Pixel Buds and the Pixel phone. When the phone was addressed in English, the earbuds translated the phrase into Swedish in her ear. The Swedish speaker then spoke back in Swedish through the earbuds by pressing on the right bud to summon Google Assistant. Google Assistant translated that Swedish reply back into an English phrase, which was played through the phone's speakers so the English speaker could hear.
While this idea might sound far-fetched, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told investors in January that Google Translate was set to make big leaps this year.
""We have improved our translation ability more in one single year than all our improvements over the last 10 years combined,"" Pichai told investors in a quarterly call, after parent company Alphabet reported mixed results.
The earbuds will be available in November for $159 but are available for preorder starting on Wednesday.

 Google just announced a new phone, computer, home speaker and more   
 3:32  PM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  01:06 
 Google hosted an event in California on Wednesday where it's unveiled a bunch of new products. Here's a rundown of everything it announced, ranging from new smartphones to a laptop, a VR headset and even a brand new camera.
 Kicking things off
 Google's SVP of hardware Rick Osterloh
 Google's senior vice president of hardware Rick Osterloh kicked off the show with a quick note that the company is introducing its second generation of Google-made hardware. Last year, Google unveiled the Google Pixel, Pixel XL, the Daydream View VR headset and the Google Home. Osterloh said, while he wished Google had more Pixels to sell (they were in short supply) it was well received by Google's audience for its top-rated camera and hardware.
 New Pixel phones
 The new Google Pixel 2 smartphones
 Google showed the new Google Pixel 2 smartphones. The new devices come with 6-inch and 5.5-inch displays. The Pixel 2 will launch in ""kinda blue,"" ""just black"" and ""clearly white."" The 6-inch Pixel 2 XL features a plastic-OLED curved display that runs nearly to the edges. It looks an awful lot like the LG V30 smartphone it's based on. The Pixel 2 XL will ship in black or black and white.
 Google said users will get the same experience on both except when it comes to the screen sizes. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL feature an always-on display that shows notifications and the time even when the device is locked. The phones can also always detect any music playing in the background and will show the phone song right on your lock screen. Neither phone offers a headphone jack.
Also, you can take a selfie by squeezing the phone. The squeeze motion can also be set to perform other tasks. The phones run ""pure Android Oreo,"" Google said.
Google said developers are already taking advantage of its ARCore augmented reality tools to provide augmented reality apps on Android. This is similar to what Apple is doing with ARKit and iPhones and iPads. Like the new iPhone 8, Google said the cameras on the Pixel 2 smartphones are specially tuned for augmented reality.
The Pixel 2 will also support Portrait mode, which Apple introduced on the iPhone 7 Plus last year and updated on the iPhone 8 Plus this year. Portrait mode applies blurring to the background to offer a more professional-look to pictures. Google uses a single camera lens instead of two, like Apple does. Portrait selfies are supported by the front camera, too.
Both phones promise water resistance and all-day battery life.
The Pixel 2 will start at $649 and pre-orders open today.The Pixel 2 XL will start at $849 and pre-orders begin today.
 New Google Home Mini
 The new Google Home Mini
 Isabelle Olsson, the lead designer of Home hardware at Google unveiled the Google Home Mini which, as its name suggests, is a smaller version of the Google Home. It's more affordable and will compete more closely with the Echo Dot, Amazon's most affordable Echo. It's controlled by touch — a simple tap on the top activates it — and Google says the sound quality is ""amazing."" It will launch in three colors including coral, chalk and charcoal. It'll cost $49 in the US.
 Nest news
 Google can show who's at the front door by streaming a camera feed to your TV.
 Google hardware and Nest products will soon  work closer together. If you have a Nest camera, for example, and a Chromecast-connected TV, you'll be able to ask Google Home to show your Nest camera on the TV. This function works with the new Nest Video doorbell.
 Google Home Max
 The Google Home Max smart speaker. It costs $399 and launches in Dec.
 Google also unveiled a high-end Google Home Max speaker that will take on more premium speakers like Sonos speakers. It includes a ""Smart Sound"" function powered by artificial intelligence to tweak sound for your environment to make sure audio always sounds as good as possible. Sonos has a similar function.

 Google unveils new smart speaker, the Google Home Max   
 1:23  PM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  02:08 
 The Google Home Max will also compete with the Apple HomePod, which has Siri built-in, and Amazon's brand new Echo speakers that include Alexa. Thanks to the built-in Google Assistant, users can ask the Google Home Max questions or stream millions of songs from YouTube Music, Spotify, Google Play Music and other services. Bluetooth, 3.5mm headphone input and more are also supported. It launches in December for $399.
 Google Pixelbook Chromebook
 Google Pixelbook
 Google also unveiled a new high-end Chromebook called the Google Pixelbook. It offers a 4-1 design that allows you to use it as a laptop, in a stand-mode for watching videos, in a tablet mode with the keyboard folded behind it, or in a tent mode to share the 12.3-inch touchscreen display.
It features a battery that offers up to 10 hours of use, up to 512GB of storage and a new feature that allows it to automatically use your phone's data connection when Wi-Fi isn't available. It's the first laptop that will feature the Google Assistant, too, complete with a dedicated Google Assistant button on the keyboard. A Pixelbook Pen stylus will also be sold with the notebook.
Three configurations will be available, starting at $999 with the optional $99 Pixelbook Pen. Pre-orders open today in the US, Canada and the UK. The laptop will hit stores starting Oct. 31.
 New Google Daydream View VR headset
 The new $99 Google Daydream View VR headset
 Google also announced a new Google Daydream View VR headset. IMAX movies will launch in Google Play Movies available for free to Google Pixel 2 owners, too. It'll cost $99.
 Google Pixel Buds
 Google Pixel Buds can translate languages in real-time
 Google also unveiled new Google Pixel Buds, its first set of wireless Bluetooth headphones. They can provide notifications, read messages outloud, and can provide quick one-touch access to the Google Assistant. Even cooler, they can translate languages in real-time. They'll ship with a case that provides charging for up to 24 hours of use. They'll be available in white, blue and black and will ship in November for $159. Pre-orders start today.
 Google Clips
 Google surprised the audience with a new camera called Google Clips. It automatically takes photos as you go throughout your day. An artificial intelligence engine inside looks for smiles, people you care about, dogs chasing their tails, and automatically captures the moment. Google says it will get smarter over time. It has a shutter button but is also hands-free and can be attached to almost anything, Google said. Photos and video clips can be saved individually to Google Photos.

Sabrina Ellis, Director of Product Management at Google, speaks about the new Pixel phone during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016.
 Google is expected to announce a new, upgraded Pixel 2 smartphone at an event today in California. Anticipated improvements include longer battery life and even higher quality photos. Our colleagues at the Verge are  covering it live here.
Google insists it has ambitious plans to  create ""compelling hardware products"" and recently announced it would be  hiring about 2,000 engineers from Taiwanese phone maker HTC to help achieve them. You can imagine future Pixels and other projects as part of that partnership (today's is reportedly a  partnership with LG).
What's less clear is whether Google has any significant changes in store to how the Pixel is marketed and sold. Because while its first version was critically acclaimed for both its hardware and software, it has not made much of a dent in the U.S. smartphone market after launching last October.
 An average 0.7 percent of U.S. smartphone subscribers used the Pixel in the three month period ending in August, according to data from measurement company comScore. For context: Apple's iPhone is used by 45.5 percent of subscribers, and Samsung phones — the dominant company using Google Android to power its devices — represents 29.5 percent of U.S. subscriber share. More broadly, 53 percent of U.S. smartphone subscribers use Android phones.
 Does it matter if Google has a successful phone hardware business? Not really — the company is still phenomenally profitable based on its search advertising business.
But Google says it wants to be good at hardware, and it can theoretically make Android phones much better — and maybe even generate a profit — by more tightly integrating hardware, software and services, à la the Apple iPhone model.
It would be a waste and a shame if Google's best efforts only reached the 1 percent who went out of their way to find them. So it will be telling if Google cares enough to make this chart look very different in another year.

Amazon's Alexa voice assistant can be used to unlock some Nissan cars remotely.
 Nissan owners will soon be able to access their car by asking Amazon's voice assistant Alexa to unlock the vehicle for them.
 Certain Nissan models made between 2016 and 2018 will be equipped with the technology that will allow drivers to tell Alexa to carry out tasks such as flashing the lights, unlocking the car remotely and honking the horn.
It works in vehicles that have NissanConnect Services's telematics system, the Japanese manufacturer's in-car software. Users will need a subscription to this.
 Later this month, users can download a new Alexa skill called NissanConnect Services in the Amazon Skills Store. A skill is similar to an app, but is specific to Alexa. Once this is downloaded, Alexa will be able to control some of the car functions.
Amazon has been striking deals with automakers to bring Alexa to cars. Last month, BMW said Alexa capabilities will be in some of its cars from 2018.
While Amazon missed out on the smartphone wave, it is now vying to be a major player in the home through products like the Echo smart speaker, and in the auto industry through Alexa.
But Amazon is up against the likes of Google and Apple, which have their own in-car operating systems.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai
 Krishna Bharat, one of the engineers who helped lead and create Google News, recently called the product ""shameful and irresponsible,"" after Google highlighted content from illegitimate sources.
 Bharat — who is no longer with Google — was specifically referring to an incident in which Google News surfaced threads from 4Chan that had identified the wrong person as the Las Vegas shooter.
Here's the full quote, posted to Facebook:
 Google friends -- this is shameful and irresponsible. Time to go back to the tried and tested practice of showing vetted sources for fresh queries at the top of web search. This would not have happened on my watch. Google News per se doesn't feature 4chan for a reason. [User generated content] is unreliable, and anything of value there will ultimately be screened by and surface in mainstream sources. Why not wait to be sure? You have a responsibility to get it right. This section is called 'Top Stories' not 'Rumors'. 
Bharat's comments come as the government digs deeper into the responsibilities of social networks such as Twitter and Facebook to filter out fake news. Twitter and Facebook have also come under increased scrutiny after investigators discovered Russia bought ads on the social networks in an effort to sway the 2016 political election.
Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Russian President Vladimir Putin chairs a meeting of the Council for Strategic Development and Priority Projects at the Kremlin in Moscow on November 25, 2016.
 Google has found evidence that Russian agents bought ads on its wide-ranging networks in an effort to interfere with the 2016 presidential campaign.
Using accounts believed to be connected to the Russian government, the agents purchased $4,700 worth of search ads and more traditional display ads, according to a person familiar with the company’s ongoing internal investigation who was not allowed to speak about it publicly.
Google found those accounts based on specific information it discovered as well as leads from other technology companies, the person said.
 Google found a separate $53,000 worth of ads with political material that were purchased from Russian internet addresses, building addresses or with Russian currency, but it is not clear whether any of these were state-sponsored ads and may have been legitimate ad spending by Russian citizens, the person said.
The search giant has been called to testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1. It has so far escaped the intense scrutiny confronting Facebook after the social network admitted that it discovered 470 profiles and pages to a Russian company with ties to the Kremlin. Facebook also said the pages had placed 3,000 ads on its network at a cost of about $100,000.
Google is the only company that sells more digital advertising than Facebook, and its role in the coordinated Russian campaign has been closely followed. The Washington Post reported earlier that Google has found that Russian agents hoping to spread misinformation had spent tens of thousands of dollars on the company’s advertising platforms.
The 2016 presidential election marked the first time that Google allowed targeting by political leanings. It allowed two categories — left-leaning and right-leaning. However, Google’s investigation has not found any evidence that the Russian ads used these categories or geographic parameters to target specific groups, the person said.
The ads mainly appeared alongside Google’s search results or on websites outside of its own network of sites, the person said. It was not clear whether the ads appeared on YouTube or Gmail.
The investigation is continuing, so there remains a chance that Google may find other ads from Russian-linked accounts, the person said.

 });Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at the Google I/O developer conference on May 17, 2017.
 Google's CEO is well aware that being one of the world's biggest companies makes it a take-down target. 
 ""You always think there is someone in the Valley, working on something in a garage – something that will be better,"" Sundar Pichai said in a rare interview published by The Guardian over the weekend. 
The Guardian asked Pichai how it feels to be in charge of Google. 
 ""History shows that the opposite of what people were worrying about is typically true. Go back 10 years and look at the largest market cap companies: the bigger you are, the more you may be at a disadvantage,"" he told The Guardian. ""As a big company, you are constantly trying to foolproof yourself against being big, because you see the advantage of being small, nimble and entrepreneurial. Pretty much every great thing gets started by a small team.""
Google has changed quite a bit since the two-man operation of Larry Page and Sergey Brin in the Stanford dorms. Investors have pushed the prices of tech stocks ever higher, boosting the market value of Facebook and Google above giants like Exxon Mobil and JPMorgan Chase over the past 10 years. Google's dominance in search advertising has not come without its scrutiny, especially in Europe, where regulators penalized the company with a record fine.
Despite Google's high profile, Pichai has stayed out of the spotlight in the two years he has led Google, at least relative to some of the other powerful personalities in the technology sector. The Guardian's profile reveals some interesting tidbits about Pichai's outlook, including that:
 He still buys print newspapers. His proposal of the Chrome browser was not well-received at the time. He thinks he was a very different kind of leader at Android than founder Andy Rubin.

 While at Google from June 2009 to February 2010, Magnuson worked on App Inventor for Android, which allows those who are new to computer programming to create software applications for the Android operating system.

 Appboy, which will soon be renamed Braze, is a mobile marketing platform that manages phone applications for organizations by collecting data from consumers and brands. Magnuson says Appboy now has over one billion monthly active user profiles spanning more than 400 clients in 35 countries and recently received an additional $50 million in funding.
The companies can then use the data collected to send personalized messages directly to their consumers. Appboy works with some notable brands including Citi Global Cards, Domino's and Urban Outfitters.

 Magnuson says that he always wanted to create his own business, even before joining Google.
""I always wanted to build something on my own but didn't have the financial capability to do so,"" he says. ""Plus, I felt that I had a bit to learn.""
So he worked at Google for a few months, picking up technical skills and insight about mobile technology.
The opportunity to create his own business in the mobile market soon presented itself at a New York City Hackathon event in 2011. There, he had a chance encounter with people who would eventually become fellow co-founders of Appboy.
""The timing was right,"" he says. ""We have evolved alongside the mobile industry.""

 Dow Jones posts fake headlines   
 3:18  PM ET Tue, 10 Oct 2017 |  00:42 
 Dow Jones Newswires sent several fake headlines shortly after the market opened for trading Tuesday because of a ""technical error."" The headlines included one that said Google was acquiring Apple for $9 billion. 
 Here are some examples of the headlines:
 ""DJ UPDATE: Google, Apple Join to Create Tech Giant"" ""DJ Google to buy Apple for $9 billion"" ""DJ Google Says Yay"" ""DJ Google Says Steve Jobs Suggested this in His Will"" 
 Apple currently has a market value greater than $800 billion. Google changed its name to Alphabet in 2015.
Dow Jones, a unit of News Corp, denied the company was hacked and sent the following statement in regard to the incident:
 ""Please disregard the headlines that ran on Dow Jones Newswires between 9:34 a.m. ET and 9:36 a.m. ET. Due to a technical error, the headlines were published. All of those headlines are being removed from the wires. We apologize for the error."" 
Other headlines clearly said ""test,"" but it was the Apple one that caught traders attention, if for nothing else besides its silliness.
It is difficult to tell if the headlines moved the market as the $9 billion acquisition size was obviously incorrect. However, computers may be more susceptible to trade fake headlines as the volume of algorithmic trading rises.

 });The new Google Home Mini
 Categorize this under ""one of the worst possible PR nightmares for a Google smart speaker.""  According to Artem Russakovskii at Android Police, the Google Home Mini he was reviewing was randomly and near-constantly recording sounds in his home and transmitting them to Google. The company acknowledged the problem and is issuing a software update to resolve the issue, which appears to boil down to a failure of the touch sensor on the top.
Smart speakers like the Google Home Mini are designed to only listen for a specific wake word — in this case it's ""Hey Google"" or ""Ok Google."" Only then do their microphones record what you're saying it, transmit it to the cloud, and try to answer your question. But there is usually a way to just hit a button and ask the embedded assistant a question. On the Mini, it's holding your finger down on the top of it.
That seems to be the rub (pardon the pun) with Russakovskii's Mini: it thought that somebody was holding its finger down on the top and so was randomly activating and recording. The good news is that the lights turned on to indicate it was listening, but the bad news is that it didn't make an audible tone, so it took a trip through the Home's search history to discover the error.
 To Google's credit, it seems to have scrambled the engineering jets to figure out the issue and create a fix. The fix, though, is removing a feature from the Mini. Google has altered the software so a simple touch won't activate the Assistant, you have to say the wake word instead. Here's Google's statement to Android Police.
 We have learned of an issue impacting a small number of Google Home Minis that could cause the touch mechanism to behave incorrectly. We are rolling out a software update today that should address the issue. If you're having any additional issues, please feel free to contact Google Support at 1-855-971-9121. 
I suppose the ""small number"" piece is good to hear, assuming it actually is a small number. Even so, it's a very bad look for Google. People are already leery of speakers listening to them and transmitting info without permission, so the last thing you want is to reenforce that worry. Also, deserved or not, people are doubly worried about the amount of information Google is collecting about them.
Finally, Google apparently wasn't able to figure out something as seemingly simple as a touchable button under fabric, which doesn't instill much confidence in its hardware prowess. At least it was fixed before the  official release date for the Mini, October 19th.

 The British government could ask internet giants like Facebook and Google to pay money towards measures to tackle cyber bullying and online abuse, proposals released Wednesday showed.
 The move is part of a broader package of measures proposed by the U.K. government in a green paper aimed at making the internet safer.
While the green paper acknowledges that social media companies are taking action to combat bad behavior online, Downing Street believes a levy could help the situation further.
 ""We believe that more needs to be done and that it is right that all companies should be involved and encouraged to play their part. This is the reason we will introduce a levy, to help us combat online harms,"" the paper said.
""As we develop plans for the levy's delivery, we will seek to ensure that it is proportionate and does not stifle growth or innovation, particularly for smaller companies and startups. And we will make sure it does not disincentivize tech companies investing in the U.K.""
The paper says that the levy will not be a tax on social media and will be voluntary. But it does not rule out underpinning the levy with legislation if needed.
Facebook did not comment directly on the levy proposal but said it is happy working with the U.K. government.
""Our priority is to make Facebook a safe place for people of all ages which is why we have spent a long time working with safety experts like the U.K. Safer Internet Centre, developing powerful tools to help people have a positive experience on Facebook. We welcome close collaboration between industry, experts and government to address this important issue,"" a spokesperson for the social network told CNBC by email Wednesday.
Twitter did not give a comment when contacted by CNBC but instead pointed to its current efforts to combat online abuse. The company is taking down 10 times more abusive accounts everyday compared with last year, for example.
Britain's government also proposed a new social media ""code of practice"" aimed at a joint approach to addressing bullying and humiliating online content. Alongside this, an annual report detailing the progress made could also be possible.
""Behavior that is unacceptable in real life is unacceptable on a computer screen. We need an approach to the internet that protects everyone without restricting growth and innovation in the digital economy,"" Karen Bradley, the U.K.'s digital, culture, and media minister, said in a press release.

 House Intelligence Committee to release Russian ads

 The House Intelligence Committee plans to release Russia-linked ads that ran on Facebook during the 2016 election, the panel's leaders said Wednesday, according to NBC News. 
 They likely will not make the ads public before a Nov. 1 hearing featuring officials from Facebook, Twitter and Google.
The House committee is investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and possible collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. Reps. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, and Adam Schiff, D-Calif., are leading the probe. 
 The announcement came following the lawmakers' meeting with Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. The social media executive also met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. 
Facebook has already shared about 3,000 ads bought by Russia-linked groups with the congressional committees investigating the Russian influence campaign. 
Google also has discovered that Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its platforms, according to reports.

Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google
 Google will invest $1 billion over the next five years in nonprofit organizations helping people adjust to the changing nature of work, the largest philanthropic pledge to date from the Internet giant.
The announcement of the national digital skills initiative, made by Google CEO Sundar Pichai in Pittsburgh, Pa. Thursday, is a tacit acknowledgment from one of the world's most valuable companies that it bears some responsibility for rapid advances in technology that are radically reshaping industries and eliminating jobs in the U.S. and around the world.
Pichai's pitstop in an old industrial hub that has reinvented itself as a technology and robotics center is the first on a ""Grow with Google Tour."" The tour that will crisscross the country will work with libraries and community organizations to provide career advice and training. It heads next to Indianapolis in November.
 ""The nature of work is fundamentally changing. And that is shifting the link between education, training and opportunity,"" Pichai said in prepared remarks at Google's offices in Pittsburgh. ""One-third of jobs in 2020 will require skills that aren't common today. It's a big problem.""
Already in the last few months, Google has handed out $100 million of the $1 billion to nonprofits, according to Pichai.
The largest single grant — $10 million, the largest Google's ever made — is going to Goodwill, which is creating the Goodwill Digital Career Accelerator. Over the next three years Goodwill, a major player in workforce development, aims to provide 1 million people with access to digital skills and career opportunities. Pichai says 1,000 Google employees will be available for career coaching.
In all, Google employees will donate 1 million volunteer hours to assist organizations like Goodwill trying to close the gap between the education and skills of the American workforce and the new demands of the 21st century workplace, Pichai said.
The announcements which drew praise from state and local politicians including Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf come as Google scrambles to respond to revelations that accounts linked to the Russian government used its advertising system to interfere with the presidential election.
Google is embroiled in a growing number of other controversies, from a Labor Department investigation and a lawsuit by former employees allege systemic pay discrimination to the proliferation of misinformation in search results and extremist content on YouTube. As the controversies have multiplied, so too have calls for Washington to regulate Google because of its massive scale and global reach.
Google's not alone fending off critics. A recent headline in tech news outlet TechCrunch read: ""Dear Silicon Valley: America's fallen out of love with you.""
The tech industry, once a shiny symbol of American innovation and pride, has found itself on the defensive after the election of Donald Trump, which telegraphed the deepening disillusionment of everyday Americans who have watched the gains of the economic recovery pass them by.
While whole communities in the nation's heartland have fallen into economic decline, the tech industry, clustered in vibrant coastal hubs like San Francisco and New York, has grown wealthy off new developments that are disrupting how Americans live and work.
The pace of that innovation is quickening. For years tech companies could not deliver on promises of hyper-intelligent machines capable of performing human tasks. Now the technology is catching up to the aspirations.
In recent years, Google and other companies have made long strides, from self-driving cars that whisk you to your destination to digital assistants who answer your questions. This new wave of automation has a dark side: It's killing off traditional jobs and stranding workers, still struggling after the recession, who are unprepared for the shift.

When Pichai came to the United States from his native India 24 years ago, it was the first time he had been on a plane. Pittsburgh was the first city he saw. Though Pittsburgh was moored to its early 20th century roots as a steel town, Carnegie Mellon University was already propelling the city into the future.
""As a new arrival, I was homesick but struck by something new: the sense of optimism,"" he said. ""I remain a technology optimist.""
Pichai envisions that transformation for Pittsburg as a blueprint for the country to make the transition to a new industrial era. On Thursday, Pichai detailed other programs Google is undertaking.
- Grow with Google is a free online program to help Americans secure the skills they need to get a job or grow their business. Job seekers, business owners and teachers can learn the basics of working with tech, from spreadsheets to email, get training and certificates through google.com/grow. Google says it has rolled it out to 27,000 middle and high school students and now plans to expand it to community colleges and vocational programs.
- In January, Google will launch an IT certificate program developed with online education provider Coursera that includes hands-on labs to prepare people for jobs in eight to 12 months and then connects graduates with potential employers. Google will sponsor 2,600 full scholarships through nonprofit organizations.
- Working with Udacity, Google is creating the Google Developer Scholarship Challenge. The top 10% of applicants who enroll in Google developer courses will receive scholarships.
- Google will give away 20,000 vouchers to get G Suite certification.
""We don't have all the answers. The people closest to the problem are usually the people closest to the solution,"" Pichai said. ""We want to help them reach it sooner.""

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a company conference in London in November 2014.
 For the second time in recent months, Amazon and Microsoft are teaming up in artificial intelligence, with Google on the sidelines for now.
 On Thursday the two companies rolled out new tools that will make it easier for developers to use open-source artificial intelligence software. This follows the companies' move in August to let its virtual assistants Alexa and Cortana talk with each other as needed.
Getting into the technical weeds, developers can use Gluon, a Python-based application programming interface, to more easily work with MXNet, the AI framework backed by public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services. And in the near future Gluon will make it easier for developers to use the Cognitive Toolkit, the framework that Microsoft open-sourced in 2015. The two companies are publishing the specifications for Gluon so that other frameworks can adopt it, too.
 Google is the elephant in the room here. Google open-sourced the TensorFlow AI framework in 2015, and it has since become very popular among researchers -- considerably more popular than the Cognitive Toolkit and MXNet:
 https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/915366704401719296
 Notably, Google is not among the companies promoting Gluon at this point. (Google declined to comment.) People who wish to use TensorFlow might find it easier to do that with a Google-backed Python API called Keras.
The announcement comes a few months after Apple introduced the Core ML software that's meant to help developers incorporate AI into iOS apps. Apple also released tools for converting models based on other frameworks into its Core ML format.
""We believe it is important for the industry to work together and pool resources to build technology that benefits the broader community,"" Eric Boyd, corporate vice president of Microsoft's AI and Research group, is quoted as saying in a statement. ""This is why Microsoft has collaborated with AWS to create the Gluon interface and enable an open AI ecosystem where developers have freedom of choice.""

An employee of British drug firm GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) enters their office headquarters in Shanghai.
 Pharmaceutical companies aren't often associated with technology prowess, but a select few are trying to change that. 
 CNBC has learned that GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson and other pharma companies are actively recruiting technologists from companies like Google and Microsoft's LinkedIn. 
The goal is to hire engineers to help modernize the processes that big pharma uses to discover and develop new drugs. 
 GSK alone has more than a dozen former employees from the largest tech companies working under its chief data officer Mark Ramsey, who was himself recruited from Samsung. Ramsey is looking to hire ""dozens more,"" from the tech sector according to a GSK spokesperson. 
""The pharma industry has been lagging when it comes to tech,"" said GSK's Ramsey in an interview with CNBC.
Ramsey sees ample opportunities for tech workers to build machine learning tools that analyze health information. One example of that is an ongoing project, depending on a green-light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to use previously-collected clinical trial data as an alternative to a control arm in a study. 
That could potentially reduce the cost of clinical trials, and provide a better experience for patients. 
Another big area is clinical trial recruitment: Researchers are finding that it's easier, cheaper and reliable enough to find candidates via mobile technologies, versus the alternatives, which involve broad targeting with radio or paper-based ads.
""Digital devices are interesting to us, as they can capture really granular data,"" he said. ""Typically a patient has to go to a clinic and get lab tests, which happens on an infrequent basis.""
The big challenge for pharma is to build awareness in the tech community. Ramsey says it's part of his job to educate talented engineers and product managers about ""all the cool things that are happening in pharma,"" and not to be intimidated if they don't have a health background.
Now, he said, about 80 percent of his team has no life sciences experience at all. 
J&J's global health of health technology Marc Leibowitz, who previously worked at Google and Dropbox, is also building out a team in San Francisco, New York and other tech hubs.
According to LinkedIn, some of his most senior colleagues include Oliver Hsiang, a former vice president at Lyft who previously worked at Google and LinkedIn, and Jill Applebaum, also formerly of Google.

 Target shoppers nationwide will now be able to make purchases on Google Express, after a successful test on the platform in California and New York, the company announced Thursday.
 The big-box retailer is among several that are deepening their relationships with Google's voice-activated shopping platform in a battle for market share against Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices.
Target announced that by 2018, the retailer's credit card holders will be able to link their cards and save 5 percent when shopping Target via Google Express. Shoppers will also have an option in 2018 to link their Target.com accounts to Google for a more personalized experience, similar to what Wal-Mart announced earlier this year.
 For example, a shopper might say to the Google Assistant on Google Home: ""Google, order me shampoo."" If that shopper has accounts linked both to Target.com and Walmart.com, but he or she orders shampoo more frequently from Target, Google will pull results from Target's website.
Target's product assortment on Google Express will include anything in a typical Target store, which will serve as fulfillment centers. In 2018, shoppers will be able to pick up their Target purchases made via Google Express at Target stores, should they want to forgo waiting on a shipment.
""Target and Google teams are working on the next chapter, building experiences that digitally replicate the joy of shopping a Target store to discover stylish and affordable products,"" said Target's chief information and digital officer, Mike McNamara.
In tandem with Target's roll-out on Thursday, Google has also unveiled plans to grow the number of ways customers can use the Google Assistant.
Until now, the voice platform has been available on the Google Home and on Android TVs. Soon, it will launch on iPhones and Android phones, so customers can order items, using voice, while mobile.
""At Google, we are focused on continued innovation and making Google Express a platform to help retailers like Target offer consumers a high quality seamless, end-to-end shopping experience,"" said Daniel Alegre, Google's president of retail and shopping.
Other retailers on the Google Express platform include Wal-Mart, Costco, Kohl's and Ulta, according to Google's website.
Earlier this month, Wal-Mart announced that shoppers could browse more than 2 million of the big-box retailer's items via Google Express. Wal-Mart was also giving shoppers coupons if they bought a Google Home or Google Home Mini, and linked their Walmart.com accounts to Google Express.
Bulking up against internet giant Amazon, more and more retailers have been touting their partnerships with Google and encouraging shoppers to buy Google devices. To be sure, the penetration of Google Home devices in American households is still less than that of Amazon's Echo devices.
Companies, like Wal-Mart and Target are still finding ways to grow with Google, promising more to come.
""Next year, we will also leverage our 4,700 U.S. stores and our fulfillment network to create customer experiences that don't currently exist within voice shopping anywhere else,"" Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce business, said in a blog post.
This will include using voice command to pick up orders in store and using voice shopping to purchase fresh groceries, he said.
Target likewise initially won't offer fresh groceries via Google Express, a representative told CNBC. But it has plans to grow in other areas with voice-enabled shopping, like apparel, home and beauty, the company said.
Today, for example, shopping for dry goods like coffee and paper towels through voice-enabled devices is more easily accomplished than picking out an outfit, where there are many more factors involved. But Target is aiming to perfect the response to shoppers telling the Google Assistant, ""Google, find me a red dress.""
Google and Amazon are pledging more voice-shopping opportunities.

 Google and the country's biggest brick-and-mortar retailers have one main problem in common: Amazon. Now both sides are acting like they are serious about working together to do something about it.
On Thursday, Target and Google announced that they are expanding what was a years-old delivery partnership from a small experiment in a handful of cities to the entire continental U.S.
The expansion will allow Target to become a retail partner in Google's voice-shopping initiative, which lets owners of the Google Home ""smart"" speaker order items through voice commands like owners of the Echo can do from Amazon.
 The announcement comes seven weeks after  Walmart inked a similar deal with Google to offer hundreds of thousands of products through the service. Other big-box retailers like Home Depot are also on board.
Voice commerce was the core of these recent announcements, and it may someday become popular for types of shopping like reordering household staples. But that's not what is most interesting here to me.
Instead, it's the promise that Target is also beginning to work with Google ""to create innovative digital experiences using ... other cutting-edge technologies to elevate Target's strength in style areas such as home, apparel and beauty.""
""Target and Google teams are working on ... building experiences that digitally replicate the joy of shopping a Target store to discover stylish and affordable products,"" Target's digital chief Mike McNamara said in a press release.
If I were a betting man, I'd wager that augmented reality will be one of the areas where the two sides will seriously explore a way to work together. A Target spokesperson said it's too early to provide details on future partnerships between the companies.
One reason for my guess: The use of the phrase ""digitally replicate the joy of shopping"" above, which sounds like a hint at either augmented or virtual reality.
Another reason: Just this week, at the Shoptalk Europe conference, Google's director of augmented reality, Greg Jones, pitched retailers in the audience on working together, and made the case why Google and retailers' interests are aligned.
While nodding to the obvious threat Amazon poses to retailers, Jones admitted that the e-commerce giant is ""also a threat to Google, since a lot of people are going to Amazon first when it comes to product search."" There is  plenty of data to back that up.
Google has already worked with retailers like Lowe's to use augmented-reality technology — which 
allows digital objects to be overlaid on the real world
 when viewed through a phone's screen — to  help shoppers find the products they are looking for when in a store.
 And the tech giant has also worked with Pottery Barn on an augmented-reality app that lets shoppers get a visual idea of what a new piece of furniture will look like in their home. Ikea, Houzz and Wayfair have built similar solutions in their apps.
Jones also told the audience that Google would be building its own augmented-reality apps focused on the retail world. In a brief interview after his presentation, Jones said one goal of this initiative is to give a wide range of shoppers the benefits of AR features without requiring them to download a different app for every retailer they frequent.
To be sure, one voice-shopping or augmented-reality partnership won't be the difference between thriving or failing in an increasingly Amazon-led world. But a series of smart partnerships over several years between Google and big retailers will give both sides the best chance at fighting back. They sure need each other.

 Amazon and Google occupy a huge portion of the corporate psyche.
Both have long elicited fear, admiration and inspiration as evidenced by the frequency with which both companies are cited on conference calls across industries.
But Amazon has replaced Google as the corporate boogeyman. Amazon was mentioned 2,090 times this year on publicly available corporate conference calls (including earnings calls, shareholder meetings, and guidance calls), up 11 percent from last year, according to an analysis of FactSet data, which goes through the morning of Oct. 11, 2017. Google (or Alphabet) was mentioned in about 1,500 company conference calls, down 19 percent from 2016.
 In these conference calls, investors are often simply reacting to Amazon's presence or  expected presence in an industry. Amazon just had to announce that it was buying Whole Foods to send  grocery stocks reeling. Rolling out a  Geek Squad competitor caused Best Buy's stock to plunge. And Blue Apron has never been able to recover from the dark cloud that is Amazon dabbling in meal delivery.
Amazon and Google are on everyone's lips because it can seem like both have their hands in everything.
Amazon isn't just an online retailer but also a media company and a  brick-and-mortar grocery store. Google, among other pursuits, is a search engine, a driverless-car maker, a media company and an advertising behemoth through which Russians tried to steer the  U.S. presidential election.
Both companies compete over personal gadgets like their voice-controlled speakers Google Home and Amazon Echo that are becoming the centerpieces of connected homes. Both vie for control over the internet's backbone though their vast  data center businesses.
In short, both companies are drawing attention from their many competitors. Amazon is just a bit scarier.

 Google and Amazon are ready to disrupt small business lending   
 11:07  AM ET Fri, 13 Oct 2017 |  00:53 
 Tech behemoths Google and Amazon are poised to put competitive pressure on traditional banks in the small business lending arena, one of former President Barack Obama's cabinet members said Tuesday.
 Karen Mills, who served as Obama's administrator for small businesses, told CNBC that the tech giants would probably push to disrupt the market and deal a blow to established lenders.
""I think they are going to dominate the market, and that is the next phase that's coming,"" she told the LendIt Europe fintech conference in London.
 ""But the question is, in what form would that come, and... under what regulatory authority?""
Earlier this year, Amazon said it had lent more than $1 billion in small business loans to merchants looking to expand their businesses, via its website.
Online business loans have increasingly become the priority of a number of financial technology (fintech) lenders. U.S. digital lender Lending Club, for instance, allows investors to loan money directly to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
""When I look at it from a U.S. view and a global view, the banks are going to come back in full force, including Barclays and others, and then on top of that you're going to have definite presence of Amazon players,"" Mills told CNBC in an interview after the conference.

Karen Mills, small business administrator (SBA), speaks during a House Small Business Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on June 6, 2012 in Washington, DC.
 ""Amazon has clearly signaled they're going to provide at least financing for their merchants that they know. And that's very smart.""
The former politician, who is now a fellow at Harvard Business School, said ""information aggregators in the days of artificial intelligence"" — like Google — would also have a competitive advantage.
""If you think about what Amazon already knows about its merchants, and then you think what Google knows about everybody who is buying and selling through its platform, one can imagine a world where they have much more information about both on the credit side but also on the small business itself.""
 Regulatory backdrop
 Mills' comments come amid rumblings of financial regulation for fintech firms.
In the U.S., a debate has erupted over whether the federal government should grant technology companies special banking charters that allow them to compete with banks nationwide.

 OCC speaks out on financial tech regulations   
 1:07  PM ET Thu, 31 March 2016 |  03:01 
 ""I think this is one of the as-yet-untold stories of fintech,"" Mills said.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), one of many regulators in the U.S., sparked opposition from state regulators and banks when it published guidance last year about the possibility of a national bank charter for fintech companies.
Mills said there is currently a ""spaghetti soup"" of multiple financial authorities, including the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But she added that there is currently little oversight over small business lenders.
She claimed there is a present fear among both traditional lenders and fintech companies that established internet giants may step up to the plate.
""If you look at the small business hierarchy needs, they need access to cash, funds, they need time, and they need more sales,"" she said.
""And what if you were able to provide an efficient system that gave them more time to do all their work, access to capital and something that boosts their sales line? You could see how that player could win over a traditional player or even a new fintech.""

 Google Home is taking aim at Alexa   
 5:47  PM ET Tue, 17 Oct 2017 |  01:05 
 Amazon's early lead in the home is a problem for Google — and not just because Alexa is outselling Home by a wide margin.
 In the new world of voice-powered computing, Amazon is rolling out popular features like skills and reminders that take users entirely out of Google's massive ecosystem. Late last month, Google added reminders to its home assistant, a long-awaited feature that lets consumers get voice prompts to walk their dog or take out the trash.
Even as Google plays catch-up with new functions and lures users with lower-priced products, the web giant faces a business model conundrum. Almost 90 percent of parent Alphabet's $90.3 billion in revenue last year came from advertising, mostly search, video and mobile.
 Whether a daily walk or once-a-year moment you just can't forget, reminders on Google Home from your #GoogleAssistant are here to help. pic.twitter.com/WpsI2TNBet— Google (@Google) September 27, 2017 
 Without a visual interface, what happens to Google's ad business?
""You basically can't deliver ads when it comes to a voice query,"" said Lightspeed Venture Partners' Alex Taussig, who invests in consumer internet start-ups. ""If I ask for the nearest coffee shop from my office, you can give me one answer and that's probably not an ad. So it is very hard for Google to monetize these product searches.""
This isn't the first time Google has been forced to reckon with a changing computing paradigm.
When consumers moved to mobile, Google faced the risk of so-called vertical search, or industry-specific queries. Rather than going to Google.com, smartphone users would open the Kayak app to search travel or Yelp to find restaurants. But Google survived and thrived by populating its Android operating system with apps for calendar, maps, YouTube and photos. Even if people were doing less search, they were still sticking with Google and serving up all that valuable data.
Now, with voice becoming the next emerging platform, Google has to again make sure it doesn't get left behind, whether in the home or the automobile.
According to a report last month from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Amazon controls more than three-quarters of the market for home automation devices and Google accounts for most of the rest.
With that kind of deficit and with the explosive growth in the home assistant market, Google is in jeopardy of losing users who have previously counted on the company's search engine, calendar and other features.
 'Mountain of data'
 In response, Home is getting more targeted. Following last month's announcement that Google is adding reminders to the device, the company is working with developers to build apps that will remind users of chores like taking prescription medications or perhaps that their restaurant reservation is in a few hours, according to a person familiar with the matter. Google is planning on announcing integrations in mid-November, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the plans are confidential.
While Amazon has your credit card information and knows your shopping history, Google knows how you search the web, providing an intensely personal view into a consumer's habits. Google's dominance online was built around cataloging the internet and knowing what to quickly surface based on a query.
""Google is sitting on a mountain of data,"" said Katie McMahon, vice president at SoundHound, a software company that uses artificial intelligence to enable apps to respond to voice commands. ""Google is going to flex its muscle off the data sets they command. The world's data is one pile but the individual pile is a unique set they'll focus on.""

 Google unveils new phones, Google home mini   
 4:47  PM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  01:49 
 Google hinted in May that it would be improving its assistant through reminders and appointment scheduling, but didn't provide specifics. A Google spokesperson declined to comment for this story.
The focus on reminders follows recent improvements to Amazon Alexa's timer features, making it easier for users to get verbal nudges to pick up dry cleaning or pay bills. 
It also has to deal with new concerns around privacy. Earlier this month, Google released a smaller version of its home assistant called the Home Mini, for $49, and a high-end speaker called the Google Max. Shortly after the release, a blogger from Android Police noticed that the Mini was turning on by itself, improperly listening to conversations.
Google acknowledged the bug and updated the software, but the flap led to further questions about whether Google is doing enough to protect consumer data.
Investors haven't punished Google for its challenges in home automation, sending Alphabet shares up 25 percent this year. The company has proven that it can deal with changing consumer habits. And when it comes to battling Alexa, it's still early days.
""The home is still a frontier yet to be owned,"" McMahon said.

 Google unveiled its first custom-designed smartphone chip on Tuesday, the Pixel Visual Core, which is used in its new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL smartphones.

HDR+ is applied on the bottom
 One example might be taking a picture of a shadowy skyscraper against a bright blue sky. With HDR+, you'll be able to capture both the skyscraper and the blue sky, without bits of either washing out because of parts of the image being too bright or too dark.
 While the chip exists in current phones, it isn't yet activated, but will be in a future software release.
The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 aren't the first smartphones to offer HDR support, but Google is trying to make its photos the best using the new processor.
Google said that the Pixel Visual Core will be accessible by camera applications created by other developers, not just the built-in camera app, and that it plans to activate access to the core through software updates ""in the coming months.""

DJ Koh, president of mobile communications business at Samsung, holds up the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 smartphone during a launch event for the new product, August 23, 2017.
 Samsung knows its Bixby virtual assistant needs to be smarter. The company announced version 2.0 of the assistant on Wednesday at its developer conference in San Francisco.
 Among the upcoming improvements, Bixby will be able to recognize different people speaking to it. That feature has recently come to the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers, which come with Alexa and the Google Assistant, respectively.
It's not clear when the upgraded Bixby will become available. Samsung said it will release a software development kit to select third-party developers in a private beta before making it available to any developer in 2018. 
 The public first got a feel for what the original Bixby could do when Samsung released its Galaxy S8 smartphone earlier this year. That phone — like the newer Samsung Galaxy Note8 smartphone — comes with a button dedicated to paging a public preview version of Bixby. The full assistant rolled out to English speakers in the U.S. just three months ago.
The reviews of Bixby haven't all been glowing. One writer at Engadget noted that the Google Assistant's speech recognition was ""significantly more accurate"" than Bixby's.
Samsung has emphasized Bixby's ability to go into individual apps and do things on behalf of people. But it doesn't always work as intended. ""I still can't trust that it will do what I want it to,"" as a writer with the Verge put it. As a result, the writer has opted to do things himself the old way — by tapping and swiping on the display.
Samsung is integrating the technology from Viv Labs — the start-up Samsung acquired whose team previously worked on Siri — into Bixby, which could help make it a better alternative to the Google Assistant.
""For example, users can just say, 'I want to order a large pepperoni pizza with half mushrooms. Please send it to my office within 30 minutes.' Bixby will take care of it — no more robot speak,"" said Dag Kittlaus, a vice president of Samsung and previously Viv Labs' co-founder and CEO. 
Third-party developers who integrate Bixby into their apps will be able to generate money in a marketplace model, Kittlaus said. 
In 2018 Samsung will start shipping TVs with Bixby onboard in the U.S. and in Korea, chief product officer Gilles BianRosa said.
But Samsung also has an eye toward making Bixby work on devices that don't support it out of the box. Injong Rhee, chief technology officer and executive vice president of software and services for Samsung's mobile communications business, demonstrated how Bixby could work with a speaker by connecting it to a special dongle that contains a microphone and wi-fi connectivity. Rhee also showed how the technology can send associated visual content to a separate display.
Bixby now has 10 million active users, the company says.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai
 The headlines are eye-catching. Melania Trump is leaving the White House! Home renovation cable star Joanna Gaines has abandoned her HGTV show and husband Chip Gaines! Televangelist Joel Osteen is leaving his wife!
None of the stories were true. Yet as recently as late last week, they were being promoted with prominent ads served by Google on PolitiFact and Snopes, fact-checking sites created precisely to dispel such falsehoods.
According to an examination by The New York Times, the enticing headlines served as bait to draw readers to fraudulent sites that masqueraded as mainstream news sites, such as People and Vogue.
 The fake news ads all worked the same way: They would display headlines at the top of the fact-checking sites that, once clicked, took readers to sites that mimicked the logos and page designs of legitimate publications. The fake stories began with headlines and large photos of the celebrities in question, but after a few sentences, they transitioned into an ad for an anti-aging skin cream.
The fake publishers used Google's AdWords system to place the advertisements on websites that fit their broad parameters, though it's unclear if they specifically targeted the fact-checking sites. But that Google's systems were able to place fake news ads on websites dedicated to truth-squadding reflects how the internet search giant continues to be used to spread misinformation. The issue has been in the spotlight for many internet companies, with Facebook, Twitter and Google all under scrutiny for how their automated ad systems may have been harnessed by Russians to spread divisive, false and inflammatory messages.
The Snopes and PolitiFact ads show how broad the problem of online misinformation can be, said David Letzler, research scientist at Impact Radius, a digital marketing intelligence firm. ''Even websites whose mission is to promote accountability can inadvertently wind up getting used by snake oil salesmen,'' he said.
Google declined to explain the specifics of how the fake news ads appeared on the fact-checking sites. The accounts that advertised on Snopes and PolitiFact were terminated from Google's ad platform after The Times asked about them, according to a person with knowledge of the sites who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential.
''As always, when we find deceptive ad practices on our platforms we move swiftly to take action, including suspending the advertiser account if appropriate,'' Chi Hea Cho, a Google spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''In addition, we give publishers controls so they can block specific types of ads and advertisers.''
When alerted to the ads promoting untrue stories on their sites, Snopes and PolitiFact said there was little they could do. Google's AdSense, which is used by web publishers to sell display advertising on their sites, works through automated tools. Often, advertisers are unsure where their ads are running -- sometimes next to inappropriate or offensive content -- and site owners don't know which ads will appear on their pages.
Vinny Green, Snopes's co-owner and vice president, said it had tried to filter out misleading advertisements from the 150 million ads it displayed on its site last month. But that goes only so far.
''We have little direct oversight or control over what is being done to filter out fake news ads being served on our site,'' he said in an email. He added that the online ad ecosystem was complicit in disseminating and profiting off of misinformation, and that ''these ad quality problems are systemic.''
Aaron Sharockman, executive director of PolitiFact, said it was working with Google to remove the ''questionable text ads'' from its site.
''The revenue those advertisements provide is critical to funding a website like ours, but it's equally important that we do everything we can to make sure the advertisements appearing on our site are not deceptive or intentionally misleading,'' he said.

Google, which sells more online advertising than any other technology firm, has struggled to prevent fraudulent websites from making money off the spread of false stories. Earlier this year, it touted its efforts to crack down on misinformation sites by kicking 340 websites and 200 publishers off its AdSense platform. Most of those publishers had created websites to peddle eye-catching but untrue political stories, and loaded up the pages to get a cut of advertising revenue from Google.
But the websites that advertised on Snopes and PolitiFact took a different approach. Those publishers paid Google to promote their content on legitimate websites to draw traffic for an ad pretending to be a news story, often carrying the banner of a mainstream news publication.
Google has called the process ''tabloid cloaking.'' It has said these types of scammers use timely topics and ads made to look like new website headlines. Google said it suspended more than 1,300 advertiser accounts in 2016 for tabloid cloaking. This month, Google said it had introduced additional controls to help publishers filter out sensational or tabloid ads.
The ad heralding the untrue story about Mrs. Trump's decision to leave Washington and the White House appeared at the top of PolitiFact last Friday. The display ad led to a fake Vogue news article claiming that the story was also featured on Yahoo, Vanity Fair and Time, among other publications.
On another PolitiFact page, there was another display ad promoting a false story about Mr. Osteen, the leader of Lakewood Church, a Houston-based megachurch, leaving his wife because she had said too much on TV. When clicked, the ad went to a fake Us Weekly page about how Mrs. Osteen was leaving the church to focus on her skin cream company.
The publisher of the fake Us Weekly site also bought a Google search ad, so that a query for the headline of the story ''Sad News For Lakewood Church'' linked to that same fake story.
In the case of the HGTV stars Joanna and Chip Gaines, the ad about the couple that ran on Snopes last week promoted a report that had been refuted already by the fact-checking site in an article a month earlier.
PolitiFact and Snopes are among the most influential and most popular fact-checking websites. Snopes was created in 1994 to debunk urban legends but has since evolved into a 16-person operation that also assesses political spin. PolitiFact, launched in 2007 as a service of the Tampa Bay Times, won a Pulitzer Prize for its work during the 2008 presidential election and has 14 state chapters in addition to a national operation.
Both PolitiFact and Snopes partnered with Facebook last December, after the social network was criticized for abetting the spread of fake news during the 2016 presidential election. Their experiment -- in which viral and popular posts debunked by the fact checkers are marked as ''disputed,'' and cannot be promoted in News Feeds -- expanded and became more aggressive in August.
Google, too, has attempted to dispel misinformation. Jigsaw, its tech incubator, developed a ''Share the Facts'' tool alongside the Duke University Reporters' Lab.
David Carroll, an associate professor at the Parsons School of Design who has researched advertising technology and fake news, said Google and Facebook ultimately don't know enough about their customers -- advertisers -- making it too easy to game the system without serious repercussions.
''For a few bucks, they allow anyone to target anyone else in the world,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''The whole ecosystem has been infiltrated, and there is insufficient friction to keep bad actors out of the system.''

 Major companies are investing in blockchain   
 9:31  AM ET Wed, 18 Oct 2017 |  00:48 
 Google and Goldman Sachs are two of the most active corporate investors in blockchain companies, according to a report.
 Blockchain is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. But it is also being developed for use in a variety of industries from finance to insurance, promising cheaper and faster processes.
The number of corporate investors in blockchain companies hit a record high of 91 this year, just behind the 95 venture capital firms in the space, according to a report by data firm CB Insights published Tuesday.
 So far this year, there have been 42 equity investment deals by corporates, totaling $327 million. This is just behind the $390 million for the whole of 2016.
Japanese financial services firm SBI Holdings is the most active corporate investor, having stakes in eight blockchain firms. These include R3, a consortium of banks working on new applications for blockchain technology, and Kraken, which is an exchange for people to trade cryptocurrency.
Alphabet-owned Google is the second-most active corporate, with investments in bitcoin wallet company Blockchain, and Ripple, a company that is working on money transfers using blockchain technology.

 Overstock.com is third, while U.S. banks Citi and Goldman Sachs are in fourth and fifth place respectively. Both companies have investments in Digital Asset Holdings, which is run by former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters.
""Big banks and financial services firms were the first corporate players to make direct blockchain investments en masse — unsurprising, given how Bitcoin's underlying technology lends itself, both technically and in popular thought, to financial services,"" CB Insights notes in its report.
Large financial institutions are experimenting with ways that blockchain technology could be used, from trade finance, to moving money. 
Since June 2014, the 10 largest U.S. banks by assets have participated in nine rounds totaling $267 million in disclosed funding to six blockchain companies, the report said.
At the same time, many banks are part of consortia aimed at exploring and developing blockchain technology. Hyperledger, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Ripple and R3 are all consortia working with banks.
 ICOs risk 'over-capitalization'
 The rising number of blockchain companies and interest in the technology has also brought bigger investment from other sources such as venture capitalists and so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs).
At the current run rate, 2017 is on pace for 188 equity deals worth more than $830 million, up from 138 and $545 million in 2016, CB Insights said. Mega deals such as the $107 million raised by R3 and the $100 million raised by Coinbase have helped to boost the figure.
But ICOs, where start-ups issue new tokens, similar to shares, in exchange for funds, have been growing rapidly. Total funds raised by ICOs surpassed the total funds raised via traditional equity financing for the first time in the second quarter of 2017, CB Insights said. More than $3 billion has been raised via ICOs, according to Coinschedule, a website that tracks the offerings.

 Of 103 blockchain companies that received initial seed or angel funding in 2013 to 2014, only 28 managed to raise further money. In comparison, of the 1,098 tech companies CB Insights tracked that raised seed rounds in the U.S. between 2008 and 2010, 46 percent raised a second round of funding.
""Blockchain's consolidation may be tight, with blockchain companies failing at a higher rate than tech startups in other areas,"" the report said.

64,2017-10-19,Senators seek a crackdown on Facebook and Google political ads  5 steps you should follow to score a job at companies like Google and Apple  Senators unveil plan to rein in big social media companies  A new bill would require Facebook and Google to publicly archive ads purchased around elections  The super-secret Google X lab has hired its own lobbyists in the nation’s capital  ,"Jacquelyn Martin | AP
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., left, and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., speak about online political ads and preventing foreign interference in U.S. elections, during a news conference, Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017, on Capitol Hill in Washington.
 Three senators began a bipartisan push Thursday to rein in social media political ads amid fears about Russian meddling in American elections.
 Should the bill gain more bipartisan traction, it would mark one of the strongest efforts yet to check companies like Facebook and Google.
Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Mark Warner, D-Va., crafted the bill, called the ""Honest Ads Act."" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., signed on as a co-sponsor.
 The senators hope the bill will curb the reach of foreign-bought political ads during American elections. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded Russia launched a campaign to influence the 2016 election and will try to do so again during next year's midterm elections. 
It is not clear how many more of the majority Republicans in Congress will get behind the bill. It will need broader GOP support to pass. Klobuchar and Warner expressed optimism that more Republicans would support the plan. 
Here's what the legislation would do, according to the senators' offices: 
 Expand federal rules to require a disclaimer and disclosure to the Federal Election Commission for paid online political ads. Ads advocating for or against a specific candidate online would also need a disclaimer. Disclaimers say whether a campaign paid for or supported the message.  Digital platforms with 50 million or more unique monthly visitors would have to keep a public database of political ads. They would have to maintain records for entities that bought more than $500 in political ads in the preceding 12 months. The database would have to include a copy of the ad, the rate charged and a summary of its target audience, among other pieces of information.  It would also require the platforms to make a ""reasonable"" effort to stop foreign nationals from using ads to influence elections.  
The Russian effort ""exposes a national security vulnerability when it comes to online political advertisements,"" Klobuchar said. American laws ""have failed to keep up"" with the technology foreign entities can use, she added. 
Tech titans Facebook and Google parent Alphabet have said they found Russia-linked ads on their platforms during the election.
Klobuchar described new regulation as necessary because of both companies' vast reach. She noted that Facebook and Google accounted for nearly all digital ad revenue growth last year and now serve as a news source to millions of voters. 
It remains to be seen what measures the social media platforms will support. Major technology companies have opposed similar rules in the past. 
Warner on Thursday described the measures as ""common sense, light touch regulations."" 
In a statement Thursday, Facebook said it will work with lawmakers to increase transparency in political ads. 
""We have already announced the steps Facebook will take on our own and we look forward to continuing the conversation with lawmakers as we work toward a legislative solution,"" the company said. 
A Google spokesperson said the company supports ""efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse."" 
""We're evaluating steps we can take on our own platforms and will work closely with lawmakers, the FEC, and the industry to explore the best solutions,"" the spokesperson said. 
Twitter has also found fake accounts and bots linked to Russia. The company has said it is taking steps to stop malicious bots and misinformation on the platform.
In a statement to CNBC on Wednesday, Twitter said it looks forward to ""engaging"" with Congress and the Federal Election Commission on ad transparency. 
Representatives from all three of those companies will attend a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1. 
Klobuchar serves as the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, which has a role in elections. Warner is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels investigating Russian meddling and possible collusion with the Donald Trump campaign.

 });If you're applying to jobs by shooting off your resume through an online portal, you're doing it all wrong. This is especially true when looking for a job at notable companies like Google, Apple and Amazon, which receive thousands of applicants a day.
 The best way to get your foot in the door at lofty companies like these is by reaching out to someone you know who works there.
That's according to Neal Goldman, founder of RelationShip Science, a business tool that helps companies find who they know at other organizations. The relationship mapping tool shows how a company, place or list is connected to another entity, with the end goal of seeing who can provide you with an introduction. For example, if an investment bank is looking to work with a specific organization, the program will match their relationship to see who they know in common.
 ""Relationships are an incredibly important asset,"" Goldman tells CNBC Make It. ""People make things happen.""
Knowing who to reach out to can be tricky, says the relationship expert. Frequently, there's someone within a company with just a few degrees of separation from you. That person is who you need to get touch with, he says.
 var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];
 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 But once you've honed in on the necessary contact, how do you get them to respond? Goldman says there are five steps you should follow:
 1. Get a mutual connection to introduce you
 If you have a mutual acquaintance, reach out to that person and see if they'll introduce you, says Goldman. You have a greater chance of getting the person within that company to respond if someone you both know loops you in.
Goldman notes that you can certainly try emailing by yourself with a warm introduction. However, everyone is so ""bombarded and overwhelmed"" at work that it's more likely you won't get a response.
""If a person introduces you, [the contact] is exponentially more likely to get back to you,"" he says.
 2. Write the introduction email
 Regardless of how close you are with the mutual connection, the person making the introduction is doing you a favor and probably ""super busy,"" says Goldman. It's up to you to make things as easy as possible.
Goldman suggests drafting the introductory email for the person using a few sentences that briefly discuss who you are and what you want. That way, the person making the introduction can quickly scan the email and shoot it off to the recipient.
""It makes everything frictionless,"" says Goldman.

 3. Get to the point of the conversation
 Once the introduction has been made and the other person has responded, remove the mutual connection from the email chain, says the relationship expert.
Once that's done, delve into why you are reaching out. Goldman says that the more clear information you provide from the start, the more likely you are to get a response back from the person.
In fact, he says, the next email should be a maximum of three sentences, discussing who you are, why you want to talk to them and proposing next steps.
""Be super simple. Use clarity,"" he says. ""The person either want to talk to you or they don't.""
 4.  Schedule a phone call
 Now that you've grabbed the person's attention, and he or she knows what you want, ask if you can schedule a phone call. Better yet, ask if there's an assistant in the office who can set up a phone call between the two of you.
""It makes it easier for them and gives them actual next steps,"" says Goldman. ""Plus they don't have to set it up themselves or check their schedules.""
If you're referred to the assistant, treat that person the same way you'd treat who you are trying to get on the phone.
""Recognize the deep humanity in this chain,"" says Goldman. ""Treat the assistant respectfully and thankfully.""
The business expert suggests asking for a brief, 15-minute call and says that you should make sure to keep your schedule open for them.
""Be upfront and appreciative and you'll be able to talk to whom you want to talk to,"" he says.
 5. Follow-up without being a menace
 So the person canceled your scheduled phone call or isn't responding back to your emails. That's standard, says Goldman.
""A lot of people are just busy. It's not about you, it's about them and their life,"" he says. ""Be amenable and try to accommodate changes.""
Goldman says it's also important to have an ""authentic tone"" when reaching out once more. He suggests starting the conversation by saying the following: ""Hey, I don't mean to be a pain"" or ""Is there anything I can do to facilitate this?""
Goldman adds that oftentimes you will try to get in touch with a person and for one reason or another, things don't work out. But then you might meet them later, he says, and establish a great rapport.
""Timing is important,"" says Goldman. ""But understand the reality that not everyone will respond.""

Senators Amy Klobuchar, D-MN and John McCain, R-AZ.
 Legislation to be unveiled Thursday would for the first time impose some regulation on internet advertising giants like Facebook and Google. 
 The Honest Ads Act would require digital platforms to archive in a publicly available file advertisements purchased around election content, according to Axios, who got a preview of the proposed bill. 
""The file would contain a digital copy of the advertisement, a description of the audience the advertisement targets, the number of views generated, the dates and times of publication, the rates charged, and the contract information of the purchaser,"" the bill reportedly reads. 
 The bill would also amend the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act to expand the definition of ""electioneering communication"" to include digital platforms and paid online advertisements —  currently only broadcast television, radio, cable and satellite communications are included.
Speculation of greater internet regulation has loomed for weeks following disclosures by Facebook, Twitter and Google that Russian entities purchased politically motivated ads on the sites during the 2016 presidential election.
All three companies have been asked to testify before congressional intelligence committees in a broad review of foreign election interference. 
The new bill is the first indication that regulation could actually come to fruition. It was introduced by Senators Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar and co-sponsored by Senator John McCain.

Sergey Brin
 Even the moonshots at Google have lobbyists.
The search-and-advertising giant is the tech industry's most active political spender. But as it seeks to spare its most audacious projects from prohibitive government regulations — big bets like internet-beaming balloons and energy-capturing kites — Google is hiring even more help in Washington, D.C..
Starting in September, the secretive Google X research lab retained a trio of outside lobbyists with deep connections to lawmakers on Capitol Hill, according to a newly filed federal ethics disclosure. Its precise agenda, however, is about as hush-hush as Google X itself: The firm, Kountoupes Denham Carr & Reid,  only revealed in its filing that it would provide ""situational analysis of policies relevant to X.""
 More from Recode:
 Here are the big winners from Stitch Fix's IPO  Stitch Fix has filed publicly for its long-awaited IPO  Jeff Bezos christened Amazon's largest wind farm while 300 feet in the air 
A spokeswoman for Google X declined to comment on this story.
The hire marks the first time Google X has retained its own outside lobbyists, but it's not such a surprising development. Along with battling onerous privacy bills and advocating for tax reforms, Google has always devoted some of its lobbying dollars toward advancing autonomous cars and drones and its other so-called ""moonshots."" All of those endeavors  contributed to the company's record $9.1 million in lobbying spending over the first six months of this year.
Recently, though, Google has spun out some of its more successful gambits into individual units. As it has done so, Google's parent, Alphabet, has bolstered them with their own government-relations teams. That includes Google's autonomous vehicle effort, Waymo, which  has hired lobbyists and policy brains this year in both Washington, D.C., and its home base in Mountain View, Calif. The additions came as the U.S. Congress began to debate — earnestly, for the first time — new legislation that could put more self-driving cars on U.S. roads.
And now the remaining projects at Google X are gaining their own bit of government affairs help, too.
One of the projects under the Google X umbrella is Makani, which aims to collect energy by kite. There's also Project Loon, which aspires to beam internet to hard-to-reach areas that aren't served by existing wireless or wireline broadband connections. And Project Wing is Google's attempt to deliver packages by autonomous drone.
A longtime player in D.C. debates over drones, Google — and the rest of its industry — is still seeking the right rules from the U.S. government that would help it test, then deploy, commercial craft. With Loon, meanwhile, Google this month learned the power — and necessity — of having lobbyists in the nation's capital. It has already secured special permission from the Federal Communications Commission to deploy Loon in Puerto Rico, where the Hurricane Maria-ravaged territory still lacks telecom services.

65,2017-10-20,Microsoft's noble attempt at a smart speaker isn't as good as the Google Home or Amazon Echo  OpenTable CEO shares the unexpected way Silicon Valley is responding to the Google anti-diversity memo  ,"The Harman Kardon Invoke is Microsoft's answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home, but it isn't as good as those products.Microsoft didn't build its own smart speaker — as Amazon and Google did — but instead decided to outsource the hardware to Harman Kardon, an established player in the audio market. It's a towering speaker that fires 360-degree audio around the room and has built-in microphones to accept voice commands for Cortana.You can ask it things like ""what's the weather?"" and ""How tall is the Empire State Building?"" Or you can give it commands, like ""Remind me to pick up orange juice when I leave work.""The Invoke serves as a pretty decent speaker and easily filled the downstairs of my house with music. It sounds far better than the original Echo and the Google Home and looks more sophisticated than both.It's also pretty good at listening to commands, even when the speaker is playing, which is important. Google and Amazon have been able to do this pretty well, too, so the Invoke doesn't really stand out here.I like the dial on top, a direct copy of the volume controls on the Amazon Echo. It also has a soft glowing light that dances around the top when you give a command. A fun little touch: If you tap the top of the speaker, the Invoke will give you a random factoid.The Invoke can read out calendar reminders if you use Microsoft's Office 365 products, but it didn't work with my corporate Exchange account or Google Calendar. Microsoft said it plans to bring in additional calendars. I also liked asking it to read out the news in the morning, though this is something the Echo and Google Home can do just as well.The Invoke can be used to send reminders to the Cortana app on a smartphone. The feature worked well when I asked for a reminder to pick up orange juice, and I saw it pop up on my phone in the Cortana app.The Invoke also serves as a phone. Skype powers the experience but an unlisted number appears when you dial, so the receiver might not know it's you trying to call.Finally, you can use the Invoke to control smart devices in your house. It worked just fine for turning my Philips Hue lightbulbs on and off, which is really the only smart gadget I control by voice.The Invoke left a sour taste in my mouth that I couldn't shake. It wasn't always reliable and lacked so many features available in other products.For instance, I left the speaker playing while I hung out in my living room working and, on numerous occasions, music from Spotify completely stopped playing.Unlike the Echo and the Google Home, you can't use the Invoke to order products from grocery stores. That might sound unnecessary if you haven't used the Home or the Echo, but it's really convenient to walk through the living room and quickly ask to order toilet paper or other toiletries, and I missed that option.You can only listen to three music services right now: iHeartRadio, TuneIn and Spotify. That should cover a lot of folks but leaves out Pandora, the most popular streaming option, and other heavy hitters like Google Play Music and Apple Music.One more thing: The cord that plugs into the bottom of the Invoke is super short, which means you need to keep it close to an outlet. It's a weird design decision.Finally, unlike Google Home and Amazon Echo, the Invoke doesn't support multiroom audio, so you can't buy multiple units and play the same song in different rooms of your house. That's one of the best new features of the Echo and Home, and it's possible Harman Kardon might add this in an update.I really wanted to like the Invoke but I just couldn't warm up to it. As a Windows user, seamless integration with Cortana and my computer seemed really neat. I just wish it could do more and that it was more stable.It doesn't stand out against the more affordable Google Home or the Echo, the latter of which is getting a refresh this month with a new $99 model that's supposed to offer better audio. You can buy two of those (or four Google Home Minis, or four Echo Dots) for the price of the Invoke and still have almost all of the same features. You'll also gain multiroom audio, the ability to order products by voice and integration with hundreds of apps and services, including more music options.If you're chasing great audio, you might want to consider the Sonos One instead. It has Amazon Alexa built in and sounds better. Plus you can add multiple Sonos products to create a multiroom effect.Microsoft needs to play in this space.

Immediately, the memo stirred up a whirlwind. 
 Google terminated Damore. He announced he would seek legal recourse. And many prominent figures spoke out against it. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO and author of ""Lean In,"" wrote a social media post saying, ""Inequality in tech isn't due to gender differences. It's due to cultural stereotypes that persist.""
""We all need to do more,"" she added. 
 Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube, which Google owns, called the memo ""yet another discouraging signal to young women who aspire to study computer science.""
Adam Grant, bestselling author and Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania professor, posted a response debunking several of the suggestions Damore made.

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 But the memo also had an important long term effect. And it's one Damore likely did not intend. 
According to Christa Quarles, CEO of online restaurant reservation network OpenTable, the memo made Silicon Valley leaders more aware of conscious and unconscious discrimination against women and people of color in the workplace.  
""I think what's different now, versus even six months or a year ago, is that people are on notice,"" she tells CNBC Make It, ""and that people are not letting things slide.""

Three tech workers walk around the headquarters of Google in the Silicon Valley.
 It also stirred many to double down on their efforts to encourage fair employment and recruitment practices, according to Quarles.
More leaders are trying to get female venture capitalists on their boards, says Quarles, who previously was an executive at The Walt Disney Company. The results could be good for business, as research shows that companies with more women in the C-Suite are more profitable. 
The ""little injustices"" that happen daily to women, such as a team assuming that a female associate will grab coffee for guests, are being ""called out,"" Quarles tells CNBC Make It.
The controversial 10-page manifesto suggested that women have a harder time getting raises or promotions because their extroversion is expressed as ""gregariousness rather than assertiveness."" It said that women don't advance in their careers partly because that they are innately ""neurotic."" 
There is ""heightened awareness,"" on gender and racial equality at work, Quarles says, which she describes as ""awesome."" And more managers, both men and women, are having conversations on the topic.

 Women read from the viral Google memo that argues men are better leaders   
 10:22  AM ET Wed,  9 Aug 2017 |  01:20 
 The memo is one of several stories that have made people more aware about the horrors many women face at work, including stories on Uber's culture of sexual harassment, sexual assault allegations against top Silicon Valley investor  Dave McClure, sexual harassment charges against venture capitalist  Justin Caldbeck and others. And it's not just Silicon Valley. Accusations of harassment and sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein have once again opened the floodgates.
""It sort of feels that everyone — the nerves have opened up and you can feel it,"" she says. ""You can sense it, you can taste it.""
In light of the Google memo, more women are coming together in ""sisterhood,"" in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, says Quarles, who worked in finance for more than a decade. 
Quarles regularly meets up with her former classmates from the Harvard Business School or Carnegie Mellon. The memo, she says, has encouraged women to talk and meet up even more as well as find ways to mentor younger women. 
At the recent Fortune Brainstorm Tech  event, Quarles became visibly frustrated when another audience member suggested that women don't support each other professionally.
She called the assumption ""bull----.""
""In Silicon Valley today, there is a sisterhood of women who are supporting each other,"" she said during the event's audience open mic session. 
Talking about that moment now with CNBC Make It, she says she felt compelled to respond to the man who made the comment.

 ""It deflects from the bigger issues and that's why I think it's dangerous,"" she says. ""It distracts, it confuses. It, you know, basically says 'Well, now I don't have to look at the bigger issue,' which is that there's real bias and real problems going on.""
To start tackling the problem, Quarles is looking inward.
At OpenTable, 45 percent of the executive team are women, much higher than the 14 percent average for Silicon Valley companies. 
But she recognizes that even at her company, things are not perfect. Quarles recently ""overhauled"" OpenTable's recruitment policies, with an emphasis on increasing diverse talent.
""I look at [the memo] and say, 'It's a chance to have conversation and we're all hyper aware,'"" she says. ""So let's get in a room and go have a conversation.""
That conversation can't be just among women, she says.
""I do believe that if you bring men along for the ride, you're going to be a lot more successful.""

66,2017-10-23,Google worked with Intel on a custom A.I. chip for its Pixel phones  Google wants to manage your credit cards and make online payment easier  Google’s olive branch to news publishers comes at a cost  ,"Justin Solomon | CNBC 
Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel.
 A special-purpose chip for artificial intelligence and other tasks in Google's new Pixel smartphones draws on Intel technology.
 In addition to a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chip, the Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL both feature a new custom Pixel Visual Core co-processor, which is meant to improve speed and battery life when shooting photos with Google's HDR+ technology, and better handle AI workloads in apps, Google has said. But the company didn't disclose details about its partners on the chip. 
Then, last week, device repair website iFixit published a teardown of the Pixel 2 XL that showed what the Pixel Visual Core chip actually looks like. The serial number on the chip in a photograph begins with ""SR3,"" like some Intel chips. 
 In an email to CNBC, a Google spokesperson confirmed that the company worked with Intel on the Pixel Visual Core and noted that no existing chip had exactly what Google wanted for the new Pixel devices.
The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL may not sell well — the first generation Pixels, released in 2016, barely made a dent. Even so, the collaboration with Google on the Pixel Visual Core chip is a win for Intel. Last year Intel canceled some chips for smartphones and tablets, although certain commercially available phones and tablets still have Intel chips or modems inside.
It's also some evidence that Intel is making some progress in AI, where Nvidia's graphics processing units are popular among researchers. Last week the company said it's collaborating with Facebook to develop AI chips for data centers.
Google has a mixed relationship with Intel when it comes to AI. Waymo, Google's sister company working on self-driving cars, has relied on Intel chips for years, but Google has done a lot of work on its own to develop its tensor processing unit chips for accelerating AI workloads in its data centers. 
Apple, for its part, designed its own ""neural engine"" chip for its upcoming top-of-the-line iPhone X. 
Intel declined to comment.

Pay with Google
 Google is aiming to make online shopping easier with a new system for storing payment information. 
 Pay with Google collects credit and debit card numbers and shipping addresses, eliminating the need to re-enter payment information on certain sites. The feature was first previewed in May and rolls out starting Monday, according to a company release. 
When checking out with participating vendors, users are prompted to select one of the payment methods stored with Google, and Pay with Google does the rest. 
 Android users can now speed through checkout on food delivery sites like Postmates, Doordash, and Yelp's Eat24. Lodging sites Kayak and Hotel Urbano are also included in the first wave of the roll-out. 
Airbnb, Deliveroo and StubHub will also offer the feature soon, according to the release.

 The relationship between media groups and Google has long been strained, with the tech group’s power over consumers sparking mistrust about the gradual closing of access and siphoning of revenues from the industry.
When Google announced earlier this month it would drop its chokehold on paywalled sites, helping publishers gain new subscribers using its own data and algorithms, media executives openly rejoiced. Some said millions of dollars would be ploughed back into journalism; others envisioned a double-digit spike in subscription conversions.
Now, Richard Gingras, Google’s head of news, has revealed a twist: in an interview with the FT, he said the group planned to take a finder’s fee for each new subscriber it brings to publishers. This would be significantly less than 30 per cent and so more generous than 70-30 split for its AdSense model.
 “We want to have a healthy ecosystem where we’ll benefit both as a society and with our business,” he said. “We are still working it out, we’re not experts in the subscription business, but the rev shares will be very, very generous.”
The question for publishers is whether this is simply Google trying to insert itself between the customer and the media business, drawing out new revenue streams for itself. Or whether its innovations in data use and artificial intelligence could still help revive the economics of the online news industry increasingly moving to paywall-based models.
This debate has come as tech giants themselves face questions over the rise of ‘fake news’, and their own role in delivering responsible journalism.
“Google, along with Facebook, are the twin suns of the news universe — they’re essential to the digital news economy and publishers have no choice but to navigate around them,” says Ken Doctor, news industry analyst and author of Newsonomics.
According to data from web analytics firm Parsely, Facebook and Google jointly send 76 per cent of all external traffic to news sites. “The real question is not the revenue share, but can [Google] move the needle on subscriptions?”
Publishers tend to agree, with increasing digital subscriptions a core goal given the decline in print. “We’ll certainly consider [revenue shares] in the way that we would with any acquisition channel analysis — that is, does the cost to acquire a subscriber come in at an acceptable level that is less than the revenue created,” says one global media executive, who asked not to be named.
“But more than that, our key tenet is the direct relationship with the customer, so 10, 30 or 90 per cent share of revenue is actually secondary to the condition of a direct relationship.”
Although Mr Gingras insisted Google was not planning to create a subscriptions business, there are still worries about such a move given the business advantage for Google to broker payments for digital goods.
“News subscriptions are currently a tiny dot on potential new revenues for someone like Google, but it does make sense for them to become more of a middleman, which they have tried to do for half a dozen years since Google Wallet,” Mr Doctor says.
“Whether those goods are subscriptions or music or movies, that is a significant part of Google’s business strategy and they haven’t been as successful at it compared to Apple or Amazon.”
The Californian giant’s move to mollify publishers has been a long time coming. In 2007, it introduced First Click Free — its controversial policy requiring publishers with paywalls to provide a minimum of three free stories per day via Google search.
Ever since, it has faced growing criticism from subscription-based publishers claiming it has strangled their business model and penalised them for non-participation. News Corp-owned Wall Street Journal, for instance, said its referrals from Google News plunged 94 per cent in the first five months of 2017, after it opted out.
“Our subscription project came [from] the emerging recognition that consumers are indeed willing to pay for quality journalism,” Mr Gingras says.
“Also, we were seeing market trends simply in the number of publishers who were putting up subscription models. Ten years ago, I could probably count the number of newspaper paywalls on my two hands. Two years ago, it was probably three dozen. Now, it’s several hundred. Next year it’ll be a lot more.”

Google is not alone in trying to fix its fraught relationship with online media. Facebook announced on Thursday that it too was testing a new way to help publishers such as the Economist and the Washington Post sell more subscriptions. The social network, however, will require publishers to provide at least 10 articles for free to start with, unlike Google, which will let publishers decide how many free samples they want to provide.
“[Facebook] is a proprietary environment. It is, in a sense, a walled garden. To really get the most out of an environment like that, as a publisher, you really need a business relationship with them,” Mr Gingras says.
“The open web is absolutely critical to the future of any publisher. This is actually where we share a common objective with publishers.”
Like Facebook, Google has been dragged into debates about their role of gatekeepers to news — in particular given accusations over the rise of fake news stories.
Mr Gingras said platforms such as Google are dependent on the survival of high-quality content on the web. “Is it a good idea for society? Of course. But, if you also look at it simply in terms of the nature of our business, the truth is the more successful publishers are, that’s likely beneficial to Google, as well. That’s our motivation.”

68,2017-10-25,Microsoft's new studios create Mixed Reality holograms  Google and Cisco team up in the cloud wars against Amazon  ,"Satish Bate | Hindustan Times | Getty Images
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers his keynotes at the company’s flagship technology and business conference -- Future Decoded 2017 in Mumbai, India.
 Microsoft is opening its first Mixed Reality capture studios in San Francisco and London, allowing developers and creators to create holograms from real life objects. Microsoft has been using its own studio at its Redmond headquarters to capture Buzz Aldrin, Reggie Watts, Max Frost, and Cirque Du Soleil performances and bring them into virtual reality and augmented reality holograms.
 The new studios in San Francisco, London, and Redmond will allow third parties to create holograms that can be used on regular 2D screens, a HoloLens device, or even Microsoft's new Windows Mixed Reality (VR) headsets. Microsoft will be licensing these studios, and it's likely to be an expensive process to capture items as holograms.
Microsoft is pitching these studios more to producers, musicians, athletes, and dancers. The software giant is also expanding its Mixed Reality Academy program to San Francisco, with a range of workshops designed to teach the basics of developing apps and experiences for VR and HoloLens headsets.
 Microsoft's new studios come just as the augmented reality wars between Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Facebook begin. Tech companies are trying to bring some type of AR experience mainstream, and a tight integration of hardware and software will be key to convince consumers that mixed reality computing is the next major shift beyond PCs, laptops, and smartphones.

Chuck Robbins, CEO of Cisco
 When Chuck Robbins was promoted to CEO of Cisco in 2015, the company's technology was in danger of losing relevance.
 When Google named Diane Greene as head of its cloud division that same year, her unit was desperate to close the gap with Amazon Web Services.
Two years later, Robbins and Greene are teaming up to develop and sell cloud technology and services in a whole new way and to take on AWS. 
 On Wednesday, Cisco and Google announced a partnership that will combine Google's expertise in building massive data centers and open source software with Cisco's global salesforce, customer support and security.

Diane Greene, Google
 Cloud infrastructure, the technology that allows businesses to offload their computing and storage needs and access their data from anywhere, has become a huge and fast growing market — and Amazon dominates it. The company's AWS business got started in 2006 and is now generating over $4 billion in sales a quarter. 
 AWS controls 34 percent of the market, according to Synergy Research Group. Google is a distant fourth with around 5 percent of the market, behind AWS, Microsoft, and IBM.
But the cloud is maturing, creating new openings for competitors.
In particular, big companies with thousands of employees and legacy servers aren't dumping all of their data into AWS. Instead, they often do new projects in the cloud and let developers test and build apps there, while leaving core data in their own data centers.
This is particularly true for complicated and heavily regulated businesses like hospitals and banks — exactly the kinds of businesses an enterprise upstart like Google wants to reach. 
 Coming in 2018
 ""This whole cloud phenomenon is gaining steam pretty rapidly, and it's really become a strategic imperative for people,"" Greene told CNBC.
""But it just can't happen that fast. It's a lot to take all your on-premise data centers to the cloud and not everything will necessarily move.""
As part of the agreement, Google and Cisco are co-developing a hybrid offering that will bring some of Google's tools for working with cloud services to enterprises that aren't ready to go all-in on the cloud. Cisco will provide security and support as well as computer networking.
A winning cloud strategy is also critical for Cisco. There's not much growth left in selling hardware like routers and switches, which have generated the bulk of Cisco's revenue, and its software products for communications and collaboration operate in highly competitive markets. 
But Cisco has relationships with the largest enterprises and governments around the world. Because those customers demand modern tools for application development and for running machine learning workloads, Cisco's ability to offer Google's services may be a way to keep them from fleeing.

 ""We've listened to our customers,"" Robbins told CNBC. ""They're looking for cloud speed and scale and agility, but they want the flexibility of running applications in private data centers as well as in public clouds.""
The Google-Cisco offering will be available for early customers in the first half of 2018 and will hit the broader market in the second half of the year.
Greene highlighted Kubernetes and Istio as two open-source products that will have particular resonance with Cisco customers. Kubernetes was developed by Google, and allows developers to build and deploy apps in digital containers. Istio was created by Google, IBM and ride-hailing start-up Lyft and is used for managing microservices, or small software programs that are stitched together to perform a variety of functions. Both technologies help programmers build software more quickly and flexibly, and make it more reliable and less likely to crash.
Google and Cisco aren't divulging how the revenue split will work. And Robbins said there's nothing in the deal that precludes Cisco from forging similar partnerships with other cloud providers, should the opportunity arise. 
With AWS still growing at almost 40 percent a year, Google is eager to show the market where it has advantages over its rivals.
""Customers are excited about this when we explain it to them,"" Greene said. ""It lets them see where we're going and how we're going to do it.""

Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.
 Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin added $8.6 billion to their combined wealth on Thursday, thanks to better-than-expected earnings reports from two of the world's three most valuable internet companies.
 Bezos picked up an additional $6.24 billion in value, which likely puts him ahead of Microsoft founder Bill Gates to make him the world's richest person. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos was worth $83.5 billion earlier on Thursday, about $4.5 billion behind Gates at $88 billion. 
Gates still owns 1.3 percent of Microsoft. His wealth also increased Thursday afternoon, by about $340 million, after the software maker's earnings topped analysts' estimates.
 Page is $1.2 billion richer and Brin's fortunes increased by $1.15 billion after Alphabet's third-quarter profit blew past expectations. Prior to the results, they were worth $49.3 billion and $48.2 billion, respectively.
Technology leaders are climbing the ranks of the world's wealthiest people this year as their businesses outperform the rest of the market. Six of the top 10 names on the list are founders of U.S. tech companies.
Next up is Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who's ranked fifth on the list at $72.4 billion, according to Bloomberg. His company reports results on Nov. 1.

 Alphabet shares pop after earnings beat   
 7:25  PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 |  00:43 
 Ads on Google are getting more clicks than Wall Street expected — but it is costing Alphabet slightly more than estimated to get that traffic.
 Alphabet reported third-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations on Thursday and revenue that exceeded estimates. Share prices passed $1,020 in after-hours trading — surpassing the all-time intraday high of $1,016.31 set during the regular session on Oct. 18. 
Ad prices went down more than expected during the quarter, and traffic costs were higher than forecast — but revenue was boosted by a higher-than-predicted surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia.
 Google is again stressing this quarter ""how we're solving big problems and making products that billions of people use every day,"" Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat told CNBC's Josh Lipton. ""And fundamental to all of this is our focus in building products with AI at their core, and we believe Google is leading the way here.""
 Here's how Alphabet did: 
 Adjusted EPS: $9.57 per share vs. $8.33 per share expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Revenue: $27.77 billion vs. $27.2 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate 
That means Alphabet performed better than a year ago, as sales surged 24 percent. In the year-ago quarter, Alphabet reported revenue of $22.45 billion and adjusted earnings of $7.25 a share (revised downward from $9.06 a share.)
Alphabet makes most of its money from ads: Cost per click is the amount that advertisers pay Google each time their ad is clicked, while aggregate paid clicks measures how many times users click on ads. TAC stands for traffic acquisition costs. 
Here's how Google's ads performed:
 TAC: $5.502 billion vs. $5.24 billion expected by StreetAccount CPC: decline of 18 percent vs. decline of 16.3 percent expected by StreetAccount Aggregate paid clicks: rise of 47 percent vs. 46.1 percent expected by StreetAccount

 Wall Street looks for color on costs, while Washington wants answers
 Google parent Alphabet has seen Class A shares rise about 25 percent this year as advertisers have continued to lean heavily on search advertising and YouTube.
Network revenues were up 16 percent during the third quarter.
""Our momentum is a result of investments that we've been making over many years in people, products and partnerships,"" Porat said.
But a growing share of ads moving to mobile and programmatic formats has been putting a bit of pressure on Google's profit margins over the past year. Apple also said this quarter that Google would become the default web search option for Siri on iOS, a deal that has cost billions in the past.
Google also spent money on Google Cloud data centers, content for YouTube, and hardware-related costs, Porat said on a conference call. Headcount also jumped to over 78,000 people, up from nearly 70,000 a year ago, as the company hired more cloud engineers. Porat said the company intends to continue investing in these areas.
""Customers tell us they are switching to Google Cloud because of our prowess in data analytics, [and] our commitment to being an open platform,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said.
While Alphabet's Google business primarily makes money through advertising, it also contains Google Shopping, Maps, YouTube, Android, Chrome, Google Play, virtual reality and cloud services.
Google's ""other"" revenues, which includes hardware sales, were $3.45 billion during the quarter, up from $2.43 billion a year ago. Google launched its Pixel 2 phone this fall and has expanded options for Google Home and Google earbuds. And Google also agreed to buy part of HTC for $1.1 billion.
 ""Preorders of Pixel on day one this year were more than double what they were last year.""
-Sundar Pichai, Google CEO
 Alphabet's moonshot ""other bets"" include Waymo's self-driving cars, Google's start-up investing arms, Verily life sciences research and Nest smart-home devices. Revenue from ""other bets"" was $302 million during the quarter, more than the $263.4 million expected by a StreetAccount estimate.
Porat has pushed Alphabet engineers to push toward achievable projects — right now, the ""other bets"" mainly make money through Google's Fiber internet sales, Nest products and Verily licensing. CapitalG is leading an investment round in Lyft.
Porat told analysts on Thursday that Fiber has been pared down, but that Waymo and Nest are making progress. Porat said in a statement that the ""terrific"" quarter reflected ""strength across Google and Other Bets,"" and a ""culture of innovation."" 
""What we're looking to do with 'other bets' is create valuable businesses over the longer term,"" Porat told CNBC. 
Google's quarterly results come as technology companies are expected to testify on Capitol Hill next week about the role of Russian political advertising in the 2016 election. Amid outcry about ""fake news,"" Pichai said on the Thursday conference call that Google is changing its model to support journalists and prevent hacking of news sites. 
That's only one of the kerfuffles that Google has had with lawmakers this year. In Europe, Google's Shopping division may have to shift focus to deal with a record-breaking antitrust fine.
""We do feel good about the steps we took, but it's early. Under the remedy, comparison shopping services have a new opportunity to use shopping ads to advertise on Google.com in the relevant countries,"" Porat told CNBC of the fine in Europe. ""Our Google shopping service in these countries will operate in the same manner, bidding alongside comparison shopping services.""

 With two-thirds of its population under 30 and an economy it is keen to diversify away from oil dependence, Saudi Arabia offers fertile ground for foreign expenditure.
 But according to one investment bank chief executive CNBC spoke to, it is technology behemoths from China, and not the U.S., that will win the race to capture this lucrative market.
""China's large tech companies like Alibaba and Tencent have a conglomerate structure and are pursuing more businesses than their U.S. counterparts like Google or Facebook,"" Fan Bao, CEO of China Renaissance, told CNBC.
 Bao explained that ""housing a diversity of businesses under one roof"" is useful for ""attracting top engineering talent,"" key for emerging markets in which workers with the right knowledge base can be difficult to source.

Business with a relative lack of autonomy from the government can also bring positives. Mohamed Abdelmeguid, Middle East and Africa analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC: ""The Saudi government, with its large holdings of assets, can provide sovereign guarantees that lessen the risk factor for a given investment—particularly at a time of low oil prices.""
Regardless of these assurances, Abdelmeguid agreed with Bao that Chinese companies are more comfortable than their U.S. counterparts when moving into early-stage markets. This is exemplified by Beijing's Belt and Road initiative, an umbrella term for the Middle Kingdom's push beyond its borders in the world's largest foreign investment project.

Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, at the New York Economic Club on May 22, 2017.
 Google Fiber was one of the company's most ambitious projects. Under the original vision, the company was going to run fiber-optic cable directly to consumers' homes, giving them super-fast internet.
 Google announced it would roll the service out in Kansas City, Kansas, in 2011, and followed by eight other cities. 
Then, Alphabet happened.
 Specifically, Google hired new CFO Ruth Porat in 2015, and that August it reorganized into a holding company called Alphabet, consisting of the core Google businesses — which provide nearly all of its revenue and all of its profit — and a set of longer-term investment areas called ""Other Bets."" 
Fiber was placed into that Other Bets category. A year later, in August 2016, the company took a closer look at the Fiber business and saw it wasn't meeting subscriber expectations. So it decided to concentrate on less-expensive wireless last-mile solutions, according to a report in The Information. A couple months later, in October, Google Fiber CEO Craig Barratt stepped down, the company ""paused"" all uncompleted but previously promised rollouts, and laid off some Fiber employees.
While Alphabet never disclosed exactly how much it was spending on rolling out Fiber, the company does break out capital expenditures within its Other Bets category. Capex there started climbing rapidly in the second half of 2016, peaking at $504 million in Q4. Then, it dropped dramatically. In Alphabet's most recent quarter, which it reported Thursday, it spent only $77 million on capital expenditures in the Other Bets category. 
Here is a chart showing the spike, which we first saw from analyst Jan Dawson via Twitter.
 #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(""dw-chart"");$(window).on(""orientationchange"",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});});
 The conclusion? Porat and the rest of Alphabet management are keeping a tight lid on spending in the company's long-term bets, and if these bets are not performing to expectations, they'll shut them down.
Investors seem happy with this discipline — Alphabet stock is up about 6 percent after Thursday'searnings report exceeded investor expectations.

 For the survey, released Thursday, 2,349 software engineers, product managers, designers, and data scientists were interviewed between Aug. 8 and Aug. 24. Respondents were asked how they would feel about working at the tech companies in their geographical region that have been recently been hiring. Hired counted the percentage of respondents in each area who responded they ""would love to work for this company"" or ""would like to work for this company."" 
In tech's mecca, the San Francisco bay area, 84 percent of surveyed tech talent would ""love"" or  ""like to work for"" Google. And 73 percent said the same about Facebook.
 And there were other high scores.
In Los Angeles, where SpaceX is headquartered, 85 percent of survey respondents said they would love or like to work for Elon Musk's space company.

Hired noted the five factors employees care most about in their job search are compensation and benefits, the opportunity to learn new skills, company culture, location and commute, and team. 
Though talent longs to work at these oft-heralded tech companies, even those at the top of the brand positivity list are not without their alleged problems. In May, SpaceX finalized a $4 million settlement with a number of former employees who claimed unfair compensation. SpaceX denied the allegations, saying the settlement was the easiest way to put the issue in the past. And in September, three former female Google employees levied a lawsuit claiming discrimination against women in both pay and promotions. Google has denied these claims.
Here are excerpts of what some employees say about working at the three companies that topped the brand positivity list: SpaceX (brand positivity score of 85), Google (84) and Shopify (83). 
 What employees say about working at SpaceX:
 ""Working here is more like being on a mission than having a job,"" says an anonymous current employee working in the Hawthorne, Calif., office according to a  review posted on jobs website Glassdoor. ""If you're just looking for a paycheck (no judgement, you do you), this is not the place you want to be. It's never boring. The work always feels important, even when it's basic stuff. Working in a rocket factory is slightly dream-like. The people around you inspire you to do the best work you've ever done in your life which is a pretty incredible high.""
Another echoes the feeling that SpaceX is permeated with an intense passion.
""If you're looking for work with meaning then it probably doesn't get better than SpaceX. You're lucky to be working at one of the only companies really shaking up the industry. We don't just talk big, we make it happen. Lots of people are super driven here,"" writes a  senior software engineer also working at the Hawthorne, Calif., office. ""If you're highly motivated and ambitious then you can accomplish a lot at SpaceX. No one is going to stop you, there's way too much work to do.""
Working at SpaceX may be inspiring, but according to the reviews, it is also stressful. 
""With so many highly passionate, driven people, tensions often run high. People will defend their points of view, you'll defend yours, and it's tough keeping your cool. Picking which battles to fight and which to let go. The overall mission does help us keep perspective, but on a personal level it is non-stop ups and downs. You watch people hold on until they get fed up and flung off,"" says the senior software engineer in Hawthorne. ""Space is cool, being a part of it is cool. But it's easy to overwork yourself without knowing it. This plus the above can lead to quick burnout.""
 What employees say about working at Google:
 ""The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive,"" says a software engineer in New York.
Says another employee:
""You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets. You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world,"" writes an employee working at the Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. ""You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management. You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing.""
But, as with SpaceX, working at Google can be all consuming in a way that is unhealthy, says one former program manager working in the Mountain View, Calif., headquarters. 
""Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, 'You have to work on weekends/vacations' but, they set the culture by doing so — and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us....""
 What employees say about working at Shopify:
 ""I've been at Shopify for a month now, and in my 20-year career it is by far the best place I've worked at. The people are supportive, trusting, brilliant and moreover extremely kind. It's a rare place,"" says a product design lead in Toronto. ""[Tobi Lutke, Shopify's founder and CEO] is doing a great job keeping the culture of a startup with the backing of an extremely successful company. Well done Shopify!""
Another praised the benefits at the e-commerce company. 
""Great benefits for employee such as 4 weeks holidays at a minimum, they are very flexible as an employer and care about their employee well being, you can work from home, they have great maternity and paternity leave, and this is only the basics of your benefits, there is also a lot of great perks, such as sportify, houskeeping allowance,"" says a former employee. 
On the flip side, one former employee who worked in Toronto complained of stress and micromangment.
""I Ieft due not even being able to log off a channel to use the bathroom without someone pinging me asking me where I am and why I'm not helping people if I'm gone longer then 2 mins. I don't need to be micromanaged to the bone. All of my friends who still work here have the same issues. Expectations that are sky high and the micromanagement runs wild. People in other positions love their jobs because this only happens to the Gurus."" (A ""guru"" is Shopify's name for its customer support employees.)

71,2017-10-31,"A recent ride in a self-driving van from Google sister company Waymo shows they're almost ready for prime time  Facebook says 126 million people in the U.S. may have seen posts produced by Russian-government-backed agents  WPP CEO: Facebook and Google have responded to advertising challenges  Facebook, Google and Twitter will want to avoid more regulation  Big tech to testify before Senate on Russian-linked activity  Execs from Facebook and Twitter face lawmakers on Capitol Hill  ","As I stepped into the back seat of Waymo's self-driving minivan for a ride around the company's test facility in Atwater, California, it felt like dozens of other times I had ridden in a minivan. That changed once I shut the door and I took off for a short drive where the minivan encountered pedestrians, stalled cars, bicyclists and a variety of staged scenarios.
 I experienced how many of us could be making trips when there's no one behind the wheel.
""We're excited where we are right now,"" said John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, formerly known as the Google self-driving car project and now a separate company within Google's parent company, Alphabet.
 ""This technology has the potential to be transformative.""
 A Waymo self-driving van encounters two stalled cars in a staged scenario in the company's testing ground.
 Not only that, but Krafcik also believes we could see vehicles without drivers on streets and highways sooner than many expected.
""We're getting close,"" he said. ""We're not going to give you a date when it will happen, but stay tuned.""
Krafcik's optimism comes as automakers like Tesla market features like Autopilot, which allows drivers to take their hands off the wheel for short periods of time. General Motors' Super Cruise allows hands-free driving on the highway.
While GM CEO Mary Barra says her company is ""quarters, not years"" from being to able to remove drivers from the autonomous-drive vehicles it's developing, no auto or tech firm has yet to roll out a self-driving vehicle that can pick up riders, take them in a trip and drop them off with no one behind the wheel.
Waymo believes that could change in the not too distant future.
Which is one reason the subsidiary of Alphabet brought reporters to see its test facility at the abandoned Castle Air Force Base three hours southeast of San Francisco.
 Four markets for Waymo
 Krafcik sees Waymo offering self-driving products in four areas:
 Ride sharing/taxi hailing Trucking/logistics Municipalities ensuring ""last mile"" transportation. Personal use cars. 
Whether the company partners with automakers, ride-sharing firms or other companies remains to be seen. Waymo is already working with Fiat Chrysler, Lyft and Avis.
Waymo is already giving a select number of residents in Chandler, Arizona, rides in self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans. As part of that program, the company has modified the vans with sensors, cameras and lidar radar so each Pacifica has a 360-degree view of what's happening around it.
The minivans also have two other features designed to make passengers feel comfortable riding in a self-driving vehicle.
First, there's a small panel attached to the center of the ceiling where riders can push one of four buttons to lock/unlock doors, begin a ride, pull over or call Waymo tech support.
 Waymo's self-driving vans have a four-button panel for riders to lock/unlock doors, begin a ride, pull over or call Waymo tech support.
 The second is a screen on the back of the front seat showing passengers what the self-driving minivan is seeing on the streets, sidewalks, and so on as it takes them to their destination.
""It's reassuring to riders to see what's happening around them,"" said Juliet Rothenberg who oversees Waymo's in-car user experience.
 A little odd, but I got used to it
 So what did I think going for a ride in a truly self-driving vehicle with nobody behind the wheel?
Yes, it's a little odd being in the back seat and watching the steering wheel turn on its own.
That said, the screen showing what's ahead on the street, pedestrians crossing the road or other cars turning in front of us was easy to understand. I would compare it to watching a much more detailed GPS map that shows you where you are headed.
 The short ride and seeing Waymo's technology up close makes it clear the technology is closer than ever to being used by the public. There are still hurdles to overcome with laws and regulations, so it may be a while until a robo-taxi picks you up. Still, Krafcik remains laser-focused.
""Our goal is to bring this technology to the world and public roads,"" he said.

 });Facebook, Google and Twitter plan to tell congressional investigators this week that the scope of Russia's campaign to spread disinformation on their sites — and to potentially disrupt the 2016 U.S. presidential race — is much broader than the companies initially reported.
At Facebook, roughly 126 million users in the United States may have seen posts, stories or other content created by Russian government-backed trolls around Election Day, according to a source familiar with the company's forthcoming testimony to Congress. Previously, Facebook had only shared information on ads purchased by Kremlin-tied accounts, revealing that they  reached more than 10 million U.S. users.
Google, which previously had not commented on its internal investigation, will break its silence: In a forthcoming blog post, the search giant confirmed that it discovered about $4,700 worth of search-and-display ads with dubious Russian ties. It also reported 18 YouTube channels associated with the Kremlin's disinformation efforts, as well as a number of Gmail addresses that ""were used to open accounts on other platforms.""
 More from Recode:Sen. Feinstein is demanding more information from Facebook and Twitter about Russian users on their sitesRussian meddling in the 2016 election: Facebook, Twitter, and Google are testifying to CongressCoursera has ousted several senior executives along with many rank-and-file staffers
 And Twitter will tell Congress that it found more than 2,700 accounts tied to a known Russian-sponsored organization called the Internet Research Agency, according to sources familiar with its testimony. Twitter initially informed lawmakers about  just 200 known accounts. The company will also release a new study that shows the extent to which Russian-based automated accounts, or bots, of all sorts tweet on its platform.
In sharing these findings with  congressional investigators, the three tech giants plan to emphasize that Russian-fostered disinformation — while troubling — amounted to only a small portion of the ads and other content published regularly on their platforms. Facebook, for example, hopes to highlight that its U.S. users are served more than 200 stories in their News Feeds each day, according to a source familiar with its thinking.
Still, the companies' explanations may not satisfy an ever-expanding chorus of critics on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are increasingly demanding that Facebook, Google and Twitter step up their efforts to counter the Kremlin's attempts to sow political and social discord —  or else face more regulation by the U.S. government.
For the tech industry, the first test comes on Tuesday: A crime- and terrorism-focused committee led by Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham will grill Colin Stretch, the general counsel of Facebook; Richard Salgado, the director of law enforcement and information security at Google; and Sean Edgett, the acting general counsel of Twitter.
On Wednesday, Facebook's Stretch and Twitter's Edgett will return to the Capitol and submit to two back-to-back sessions before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. There, they'll be joined by Kent Walker, the general counsel of Google.
Upon entering the hearings, these tech giants each pledged to improve their handling of political advertising — seemingly in a bid to  stave off congressional scrutiny.  Facebook and  Twitter, for example, in October promised more manual review of those ads, along with greater disclosure as to who is paying for them in the first place.
And Google newly revealed on Monday that it would do the same. The company announced that it sought to create a new database for election ads purchased on AdWords and YouTube, along with stronger disclosure rules and a new ad transparency report due in 2018. Google said it would also put in place new procedures to verify that advertisers running political ads are based in the U.S.
But lawmakers' concerns aren't limited to ads. Members of Congress are likely to press some tech executives on their handling of organic posts — the stories, status updates or other content published and shared on social media sites without cost. In many ways, this content is harder to identify, and at times it is impossible to regulate in a way that doesn't trigger free-speech concerns.
At Facebook, for example, Russian trolls created 80,000 pieces of organic content between January 2015 and August 2017, the company plans to tell lawmakers at the hearing. About 29 million Americans saw those posts directly in their News Feed over that two-year period. And those users also liked, shared and followed these posts and pages, exposing them to their friends — meaning 126 million U.S. users in total might have seen at least some Russian-generated content, according to a source familiar with the findings.
On Instagram, meanwhile, Facebook deleted roughly 170 accounts tied to Russian trolls that posted about 120,000 pieces of content, the company plans to reveal in its testimony.
Taken together, those organic posts had a much greater reach than the 3,000 ads purchased by Russian agents on Facebook around Election Day. In October, the company provided key congressional committees with copies of the ads, which sought to sow social and political unrest around contentious topics, including immigration and Black Lives Matter.
Muck like its peers, though, Facebook plans to stress to U.S. lawmakers that the activity represents only a fraction of what happens daily on its site. Russian-generated disinformation during the election amounted to four-thousandths (0.004) of one percent of content in the News Feed, according to a source familiar with the company's findings.
Google, meanwhile, plans to tell Congress that it ""found only limited activity on our services,"" wrote general counsel Walker and Salgado, a company security executive, in a blog post published before the hearing.
Initially, sources had flagged $4,700 in ad spending by Russia's so-called Internet Research Agency, and Google finally confirmed the number Monday. In doing so, it said search and display ads were not targeted based on users' geography or political preferences.
Its audit of YouTube, meanwhile, turned up 18 channels tied to Russian trolls, which had uploaded 1,108 videos. In total, they had been viewed roughly 309,000 times between June 2015 and November 2017; about 3 percent of those videos had more than 3,000 views. The channels have been suspended.
Yet one of Google's biggest challenges — much like Facebook and Twitter — is its handling of organic content, including videos uploaded by RT, a Russian government-funded news network. Called a propaganda arm of the Kremlin, RT videos have millions of views on YouTube. In Google's investigation, however, the tech giant said it ""found no evidence of manipulation of our platform or policy violations."" As a result, Google said that RT and other state-sponsored media outlets are still ""subject to our standard rules.""
Twitter, for its part, recently banned RT from advertising on its platform, though the publication is still allowed to tweet there. Facebook has announced no change.
For its part, Twitter plans to unveil two new key findings during its testimony to Congress, sources told Recode on Monday. Chief among them: The company's acting general counsel, Edgett, will note that the company had discovered — and suspended — roughly 2,752 accounts tied to known Kremlin trolls.
Initially, Twitter pegged this number at about 200 accounts. And while the company at the time described it as an early estimate, it still faced sharp criticism from lawmakers like Sen. Mark Warner, who charged that the company hadn't done an exhaustive investigation.
Twitter also sought to study election-related tweets sent between Sept. 1 and Nov. 15, 2016. Among a pool of 189 million tweets, the company identified about 1.4 million sent by automated Russian-affiliated accounts.
In Twitter's estimation, that's less than three-quarters of a percent of all of the election-sampled tweets sent using its service over a roughly two-month window — and Edgett will stress they ""underperformed"" in generating impressions on the site when compared to an average, normal tweet. In contrast, Twitter also noted that tweets from accounts including WikiLeaks tended to benefit from significantly more engagement by Russian bots.

72,2017-11-01,Senators blast tech companies for their failure to stop Russian mischief on their platforms  This Google executive discusses the global nature of policing content  ,"Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Senator Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, right, and ranking member Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, listen during a hearing on social media influence in the 2016 U.S. elections in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2017.
 Members of Congress blasted representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google on Wednesday for what they said was their inadequate response to Russian mischief made on their platforms during the 2016 election.
 ""I don't think you get it,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told the companies' general counsels during the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. ""What we're talking about is a cataclysmic change. What we're talking about is the beginning of cyberwarfare.""
Facebook's Colin Stretch, Twitter's Sean Edgett and Google's Kent Walker revealed little new information about the extent of foreign influence on their platforms. 
 Representatives of the companies appeared before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday and were due to testify at a House Intelligence Committee hearing later Wednesday.
The companies appeared under-prepared to answer some of the questions on Wednesday. Stretch, Edgett and Walker produced statistics of Russia-linked advertisements and accounts, but questions about more general Russia propaganda on the platforms and socially divisive content drew only silences and promises to provide the information at a later date. 
Facebook said this week that Russian-backed election content on the platform reached 126 million Americans; Twitter found 36,000 Russian accounts were active during the election; and Google said  pro-Russian groups purchased $4,700 worth of ads on its platforms.
Senators repeatedly interrupted the general counsels' answers and moved on before allowing them to finish, clearly exasperated by the counsels' tendency to provide long-winded answers — and often by the answers themselves.
""It's not clear that you or the public understand the degree of this,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ""You need to stop paying lip service.""
Wyden asked the three whether they were satisfied with their platforms' monitoring of foreign influence during the 2016 presidential election — all three said no.
""This is not a Democrat or Republic issue. This is an American issue"", said Sen. Joe Manchin, D-WV. ""You cannot allow what's going on against the United States of America. You're on the front lines with us.""
Manchin said the companies' inaction threatened the security, safety and ""sovereignty of our nation."" 
The week's hearings could mark a turning point for the internet giants as discussions of regulation come to fore. Twitter and Facebook have each moved to increase transparency around advertising, after public comments by CEOs Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg.
Several senators indicated during Wednesday's hearing that legislation could be on the horizon for the tech companies, though they varied on the extent.
Manchin asked for the companies' reactions to the proposed Honest Ads Act, which would require greater information around political content . Only Twitter provided an answer, and it was mostly supportive. Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma said any legislation may have only the ""lightest touch.""

 This Google executive discusses the global nature of policing content   
 10:33  PM ET Wed,  1 Nov 2017 |  02:53 
 Facebook said this week that Russian-backed election content on the platform reached 126 million Americans; Twitter found 36,000 Russian accounts were active during the election; and Google said pro-Russian groups purchased $4,700 worth of ads on its platforms.
 But the spread of propaganda and misinformation online is a global problem that has yet to be fully solved, according to a Google executive.
""Most of the media has focused on in the U.S., but it's a global problem, in the sense that we need to ensure that people have access to the right type of information,"" Karim Temsamani, president for Asia Pacific at Google, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
 Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google appeared before members of the U.S. Congress this week to testify about the extent of foreign influence on their platforms during the 2016 presidential election.
They were criticized for what the politicians said was an inadequate response to Russian online activities.
To be clear, the Russian government has denied any attempts to influence the election, in which President Donald Trump defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
Previously, in an interview with Fast Company, Alphabet Chairman Eric Schmidt said that the company — Google's parent — didn't anticipate the extent to which governments would use hacking to control the information space. He was referring specifically to the alleged Russian interference in the U.S. election. Schmidt added he was worried that the next U.S. presidential election in 2020 will see the Russians having ""a lot more powerful tools.""

 Temsamani agreed with Schmidt's sentiment, saying ""I think we've been surprised by the extent that it has grown at."" He pointed out, however, that what differentiated Google from the likes of Facebook and Twitter was that it was not a social media platform. That meant the chances of seeing many targeted ads was much lower on Google platforms.
""So we've been a lot more protected and also we've had very strong security systems in place to stop that happening,"" he said.
There are two separate problems at hand, according to Temsamani. First is the prevalence of terrorism-related content and second is the spread of misinformation through fake news.
Google has put systems and practices in place that help to take down terrorism-related content faster, he said, adding that the company has adjusted its policies to make such information harder to find on its platforms like YouTube. Google also has brought in more people to review content, according to Temsamani.

Committee ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) speaks during a hearing before the House (Select) Intelligence Committee November 1, 2017 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.
 During a series of hearings before House and Senate committees this week, members of Congress trotted out poster boards showing graphic examples of social media advertisements that attempted to influence the 2016 election. With headlines like ""Heritage, not hate. The South will rise again!"" and ""Join us because we care. Black matters!"" these ads focused on polarizing, hot-button issues including gun ownership, race relations, immigration, and religion, simultaneously targeting both sides of each debate in an effort to foment unrest.
 Attorneys for Facebook, Google, and Twitter sat in the hot seat during these hearings and offered Congress assurances that they take the issue seriously and are implementing new controls to prevent misleading advertising. The issue with those safeguards, however, is that they are not likely to be effective. Many of them depend heavily upon artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies that simply aren't yet up to the challenge, at least on their own.
At the heart of these approaches is the belief that social media companies can develop models that automatically identify false and misleading advertisements, as well as advertisers operating under a false flag. The reality is that parties seeking to defeat these automated safeguards can continually alter their advertisements until they discover content that passes through the algorithm's filters.
 This doesn't mean, however, that artificial intelligence can't be a valuable tool in the fight against fake news. It just can't be our only tool. Effective approaches to combatting misleading advertisements must combine technology with old-fashioned human investigative skills. There are two key actions industry can take to protect the integrity of online advertising.
 ""Make no mistake about it. These mechanisms will be expensive, but they are necessary to preserving the integrity of online platforms as trusted forums.""
 First, companies should verify and disclose the identities of online advertisers. The American public has the right to know when they're viewing paid content and deserves to understand who is putting up the money to sponsor those messages. During Tuesday's hearings, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana addressed this issue bluntly: ""I don't believe that you have the ability to determine the identity of all of your advertisers,"" he told attorneys for Facebook, Google, and Twitter. ""You're good, but you're not that good."" Overcoming the skepticism of Senator Kennedy will require that social media firms roll up their sleeves and dig into records to confirm the identity of advertisers.
Second, the content of advertisements also requires careful scrutiny. Advertisements from new advertisers should be reviewed by a human trained to identify blatantly false and misleading advertisements - prior to their publication. This single control will prevent propaganda purveyors from simply creating new advertising accounts each time they are shut down.
Make no mistake about it. These mechanisms will be expensive, but they are necessary to preserving the integrity of online platforms as trusted forums. Recent estimates place the size of the online advertising market at $83 billion this year. Surely, there's some room in that budget for the staff required to screen advertisers and advertising content.
In fact, according to a  report in Wired magazine, Google has had a similar model in place since 2004. The company hires a virtual army of content screeners to view YouTube videos searching for offensive content. Their goal? To make sure that paid advertisements don't wind up running alongside offensive content, potentially tarnishing the reputation of their corporate customers. It's time to take this same approach to protect society from misleading and dangerous advertisements.
Social media companies find themselves at a crucial crossroads. They may choose to apply their considerable talent and wealth toward the goal of creating what Sean Edgett, attorney for Twitter, described to Congress as ""a safe, open, transparent, and positive platform."" Or they may decide that rigorous screening of potential customers is not a justifiable investment.
Will Google, Facebook, Twitter, and their counterparts take these steps? While it would be ideal, history tells us that self-regulation rarely works in the absence of government oversight. That's why we have the FTC, FDA, and other watchdog agencies. Social media platforms would be wise to heed the warning issued by Senator Dianne Feinstein during Wednesday's hearings: ""You have to be the ones to do something about it…or we will.""
Senator Feinstein is right. The American people are watching. Do the right thing.

74,2017-11-03,"The tricks app makers use to get ranked more highly in the App Store and Google Play  Facebook, Google, Microsoft, SpaceX to Trump: US will lose $460.3 billion if we end 'dreamer' protection  ","Chesnot | Getty Images
A customer holds an Apple iPhone X, the new model of Apple smartphone at the Apple Store Saint-Germain on November 3, 2017 in Paris, France.
 With so many apps out there, it's hard to get noticed.
 ""When you have over 2 million apps in the iOS app store, how you get your app downloaded verses other apps becomes important,"" said Amir Ghodrati, director of market insights for App Annie.
Developers have come up with tactics to get their apps to number one in Apple's App Store and Google Play, the store for Android devices. Here are some tricks App Annie has noticed. 
 Buy an ad for a popular search term
 Users are likely to download the first result when they are searching for a specific app. Sixty-five percent of app downloads come from searches in the App Store, according to App Annie.
""With iOS search ads introduced last year, people are basically looking for key words they think are going to be popular and then paying money to pay to rank to the top spot,"" Ghodrati said. 
Many companies buy their own names in order to ensure they have the top spot. Smaller companies might use popular companies to boost their popularity, such as Motif Fashion & Jewelry buying an ad on the term ""Etsy."" Occasionally, rivals will purchase a competitor's name in order to appear above the official app in search results, such as Walmart advertising on the ""Target"" search term:
 Or  Amazon advertising on the ""Walmart"" search term:
 Or Lyft advertising for drivers on the ""Uber"" search term.
 Change the app name or logo to fit the season
 App Annie noticed many apps changing their name or image icon to fit seasonal events like Christmas, Halloween or Valentine's Day. However, the most popular event to inspire a name change is Black Friday. 
A coupon and local deal app called Retale updated its name to ""Black Friday 2016: Ads, Shopping Deals & Coupons"" a few weeks before the big shopping day. It rose from number 7 to number 3 in its category and retained third place through Cyber Monday, according to App Annie. Over the week of Black Friday, Retale saw a 100 percent increase in daily downloads over the two prior weeks, App Annie noted. 
This season, Wal-Mart has updated its icon to a present, added snow to its screenshots and added the line ""Our elves have been hard at work so you'll save time during the holidays and every day"" to its version notes. The app description also updated to include information about free shipping and using your phone to pay at the store quickly. 
 Change your category
 In order to reach the top spot, some apps will change their category to rank higher. Since there are so many social networking apps and Instagram and Snap dominate the category, many search for another affiliated vertical.
For instance, Twitter switched from social networking to news in April 2016, and has since been leading the news category.
 Add key words to your product description
 There are always several buzz words floating around the tech scene. Thanks to the iPhone X, the app keyword search volume for ""augmented reality"" has gone up 25 percent month over month, according to App Annie. As a response, it saw many companies are adding the words ""augmented reality"" or specifically mentioning iOS 11 in their descriptions and functionalities.
For example, Amazon's latest update highlights the fact it allows for augmented reality furniture placement so you can see products in your room before you buy them. 
But because so many developers are adding augmented reality to their descriptions, companies that use that term are finding it more difficult to rise in the ranks. It is 14 percent more difficult in the App Store and 37 percent harder in the Google Play store to move up spots by using ""augmented reality"" since the iPhone X was announced in September, App Annie said.

 });The future of ""Dreamers,"" children who arrived in the United States illegally, is pitting President Donald Trump against big tech.
 And this week, big tech upped its opposition to Trump's effort to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by filing an amicus brief, or a legal statement of support, in California on Wednesday.
The amicus brief breaks down how damaging it would be to U.S. companies, workers and the economy for DACA to be repealed. The lawsuit says if DACA is rescinded, the U.S. economy would lose $460.3 billion over the next ten years. Contributions to Social Security and Medicare would be reduced by $24.6 billion in the same time frame, the lawsuit says.
 In September, Trump decided to rescind DACA, which President Obama had established in 2012. Trump said he would allow the program to expire in March. Trump claimed Obama overreached his legislative authority to set up DACA, but the lawsuit big tech is supporting refutes this claim.
""DACA closely resembles deferred action programs adopted in the past, and complies fully with the applicable statute. The agency's rescission of DACA, predicated entirely on that erroneous legal conclusion, therefore cannot stand,"" the lawsuit says.

 Zuckerberg says it's a 'sad day' as tech execs slam Trump for ending DACA   
 2:38  PM ET Tue,  5 Sept 2017 |  01:03 
 The amicus brief included signatories of 108 tech firms including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Tesla, SpaceX, Uber, Twitter, Verizon, Lyft, eBay, and the list goes on.
 DACA gives ""Dreamers"" the ability to work in the U.S. legally. The $460 billion hit to the U.S. economy if DACA is rescinded is because 700,000 ""dreamers,"" who are currently employed, would lose their jobs in the next two years. That's equivalent to 1,400 dreamers losing their job every day, the lawsuit says.
""Dreamers"" currently work at 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Walmart, Apple, General Motors, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Home Depot and Wells Fargo, the lawsuit says. Replacing those ""Dreamers"" put out of work will cost U.S. companies $6.3 billion.
The lawsuit disputes the claim that ""Dreamers"" are taking jobs that would otherwise go to Americans, instead positing ""Dreamers"" are often taking jobs that companies struggle to fill with qualified workers.
""The jobs being filled by Dreamers post-DACA are largely jobs for which there is a shortage of qualified workers—not the jobs that are or could be filled by U.S.-born workers,"" the lawsuit says. Indeed, since 2012, when Obama established DACA, the unemployment rate has fallen by almost half, the lawsuit says.
In September, when Trump announced his decision to rescind DACA initially, there was an outpouring of support from tech CEOs and leaders.""This is a sad day for our country. The decision to end DACA is not just wrong. It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream, encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government, and then punish them for it,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a public Facebook post.
Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a tweet, ""Dreamers are our neighbors, our friends and our co-workers. This is their home.""

75,2017-11-06,Building A.I. That Can Build A.I.  Salesforce and Google form new strategic cloud partnership  Salesforce CEO: Salesforce and Google Analytics together 'really exciting' for customers  Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announces deeper tie-up with Google  Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff announces deeper tie-up with Google  CRM's deeper tie-up with Google  ,"Pradeep Gaur | Mint | Getty Images
Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks during Digital Unlocked Google event at Taj palace on January 4, 2017 in New Delhi, India.
 They are a dream of researchers but perhaps a nightmare for highly skilled computer programmers: artificially intelligent machines that can build other artificially intelligent machines.
With recent speeches in both Silicon Valley and China, Jeff Dean, one of Google’s leading engineers, spotlighted a Google project called AutoML. ML is short for machine learning, referring to computer algorithms that can learn to perform particular tasks on their own by analyzing data. AutoML, in turn, is a machine-learning algorithm that learns to build other machine-learning algorithms.
With it, Google may soon find a way to create A.I. technology that can partly take the humans out of building the A.I. systems that many believe are the future of the technology industry.
 The project is part of a much larger effort to bring the latest and greatest A.I. techniques to a wider collection of companies and software developers.
The tech industry is promising everything from smartphone apps that can recognize faces to cars that can drive on their own. But by some estimates, only 10,000 people worldwide have the education, experience and talent needed to build the complex and sometimes mysterious mathematical algorithms that will drive this new breed of artificial intelligence.
The world’s largest tech businesses, including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, sometimes pay millions of dollars a year to A.I. experts, effectively cornering the market for this hard-to-find talent. The shortage isn’t going away anytime soon, just because mastering these skills takes years of work.
The industry is not willing to wait. Companies are developing all sorts of tools that will make it easier for any operation to build its own A.I. software, including things like image and speech recognition services and online chatbots.
“We are following the same path that computer science has followed with every new type of technology,” said Joseph Sirosh, a vice president at Microsoft, which recently unveiled a tool to help coders build deep neural networks, a type of computer algorithm that is driving much of the recent progress in the A.I. field. “We are eliminating a lot of the heavy lifting.”
This is not altruism. Researchers like Mr. Dean believe that if more people and companies are working on artificial intelligence, it will propel their own research. At the same time, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft see serious money in the trend that Mr. Sirosh described. All of them are selling cloud-computing services that can help other businesses and developers build A.I.
“There is real demand for this,” said Matt Scott, a co-founder and the chief technical officer of Malong, a start-up in China that offers similar services. “And the tools are not yet satisfying all the demand.”
This is most likely what Google has in mind for AutoML, as the company continues to hail the project’s progress. Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, boasted about AutoML last month while unveiling a new Android smartphone.
Eventually, the Google project will help companies build systems with artificial intelligence even if they don’t have extensive expertise, Mr. Dean said. Today, he estimated, no more than a few thousand companies have the right talent for building A.I., but many more have the necessary data.
“We want to go from thousands of organizations solving machine learning problems to millions,” he said.
Google is investing heavily in cloud-computing services — services that help other businesses build and run software — which it expects to be one of its primary economic engines in the years to come. And after snapping up such a large portion of the world’s top A.I researchers, it has a means of jump-starting this engine.
Neural networks are rapidly accelerating the development of A.I. Rather than building an image-recognition service or a language translation app by hand, one line of code at a time, engineers can much more quickly build an algorithm that learns tasks on its own.
By analyzing the sounds in a vast collection of old technical support calls, for instance, a machine-learning algorithm can learn to recognize spoken words.
But building a neural network is not like building a website or some run-of-the-mill smartphone app. It requires significant math skills, extreme trial and error, and a fair amount of intuition. Jean-François Gagné, the chief executive of an independent machine-learning lab called Element AI, refers to the process as “a new kind of computer programming.”

In building a neural network, researchers run dozens or even hundreds of experiments across a vast network of machines, testing how well an algorithm can learn a task like recognizing an image or translating from one language to another. Then they adjust particular parts of the algorithm over and over again, until they settle on something that works. Some call it a “dark art,” just because researchers find it difficult to explain why they make particular adjustments.
But with AutoML, Google is trying to automate this process. It is building algorithms that analyze the development of other algorithms, learning which methods are successful and which are not. Eventually, they learn to build more effective machine learning. Google said AutoML could now build algorithms that, in some cases, identified objects in photos more accurately than services built solely by human experts.
Barret Zoph, one of the Google researchers behind the project, believes that the same method will eventually work well for other tasks, like speech recognition or machine translation.
This is not always an easy thing to wrap your head around. But it is part of a significant trend in A.I. research. Experts call it “learning to learn” or “meta-learning.”
Many believe such methods will significantly accelerate the progress of A.I. in both the online and physical worlds. At the University of California, Berkeley, researchers are building techniques that could allow robots to learn new tasks based on what they have learned in the past.
“Computers are going to invent the algorithms for us, essentially,” said a Berkeley professor, Pieter Abbeel. “Algorithms invented by computers can solve many, many problems very quickly — at least that is the hope.”
This is also a way of expanding the number of people and businesses that can build artificial intelligence. These methods will not replace A.I. researchers entirely. Experts, like those at Google, must still do much of the important design work. But the belief is that the work of a few experts can help many others build their own software.
Renato Negrinho, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who is exploring technology similar to AutoML, said this was not a reality today but should be in the years to come. “It is just a matter of when,” he said.

 CRM's deeper tie-up with Google   
 7:11  PM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  01:04 
 Salesforce.com and Alphabet's Google are teaming up to help their customers be more productive, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told CNBC on Monday.
 ""You look to Google, you see this incredible world of information, you see the advertising but you also get Google Analytics,"" Benioff told CNBC's Jim Cramer in an exclusive interview on ""Mad Money.""
""And Google Analytics coupled with Salesforce's sales and service and marketing means that both of our customers are going to have customer insights that they've never had before. That is really exciting.""
 The partnership will combine Salesforce's customer relations management technology with Google's G Suite, a series of business-friendly apps designed to stoke collaboration and productivity. The Google product competes primarily against Microsoft Office 365.
Google will also offer a company-wide promotion to give free G Suite licenses for up to one year to all Salesforce customers that are new to G Suite.
The deal will also connect Salesforce with Google Analytics, allowing joint customers to merge sales, marketing and advertising data stored in both systems.
Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president of ads and commerce, told Cramer that this component will help give their marketing clients a broader view of consumer activity, online and offline.
""This partnership addresses the No. 1 request that we have from our customers,"" Ramaswamy said. ""Our customers want a holistic view, a total view across Salesforce's CRM systems and Analytics, where all the website action takes place. This is really a first-of-its-kind integration.""
Today's news includes an expansion of the existing partnership between the Google Cloud Platform and Salesforce, which also has existing partnerships with Amazon Web Services and Cisco Systems, among other tech titans.
In the same interview, Google Cloud Senior Vice President Diane Greene said that partnering with a company that offers software-as-a-service on such a massive scale could move the needle for Google.
""I dream of being No. 1. I think it's possible,"" she told Cramer. ""We're making unbelievable progress and I think having one of the world's largest SaaS vendors running on our core services on our Cloud really underscores just how enterprise-ready we are.""
In May 2014, Salesforce announced it would enter a strategic partnership with Microsoft to create a similar linkage between Salesforce's CRM system and Microsoft Office and Windows.
Soon after, reports emerged of a potential acquisition of Salesforce by Microsoft, but deal talks ended when the companies couldn't agree on a price.
Since then, the two companies' relations have fizzled. Tensions rose to a high when Microsoft outbid Salesforce for professional social network LinkedIn in 2015.
In November 2016, Benioff commented on the fallout, saying that ""the new Microsoft"" under CEO Satya Nadella was much like the ""old Microsoft"" under Steve Ballmer, who was notoriously averse to corporate partnerships.

Dara Khosrowshahi
 Uber's new CEO had employees write and vote on cultural guidelines for the workplace — and the results should look familiar to anyone that works in the technology industry. 
 There were about 1,200 submissions from Uber employees, and the final rules were voted on 22,000 times, according to CEO  Dara Khosrowshahi, who shared the results on LinkedIn.
The results were: 
 We build globally, we live locally. We are customer obsessed.  We celebrate differences.  We do the right thing.  We act like owners.  We persevere. We value ideas over hierarchy.  We make big bold bets.  
Uber was tasked with creating new cultural guidelines after a searing workplace culture report,  compiled in part by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his firm, Covington & Burling, after sexual harassment allegations surfaced. The report, supported by Uber's board, recommended Uber replace its previous 14 cultural values, which included ""Let builders build,"" ""always be hustlin'"", ""meritocracy and toe-stepping"", and ""principled confrontation."" 
Some of the core principles, like being ""obsessed"" with the customer and being ""bold"" carried over to Uber's new guidelines, while others, like ""meritocracy,"" were reformulated. 
But while Uber's old manifesto included unique slang like ""super-pumpedness,"" the new version looks a lot like the ones across Silicon Valley. For instance, one of Facebook's core values is ""be bold,"" and ""do the right thing"" isn't so different than Google's ""don't be evil."" Being customer-obsessed and treating employees like owners are both tenets in Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo's 1997 shareholder letter. The ride-hailing start-up, which has ambitions to disrupt transportation on a larger scale, also borrows from a saying common in urban planning, ""think globally, act locally.""
The similarities emphasize Uber's enormous size, which has quickly grown to be more like a publicly traded tech giant than a scrappy start-up. Facebook made a similar change, dropping the slogan ""move fast and break things"" in 2014 in favor of putting people first. Khosrowshahi, who has been Uber CEO since late August, has said he's preparing the company to go public.
""It's that forward-leaning, fearless approach that has underpinned much of Uber's success and has attracted many employees, including me, to the company,"" Khosrowshahi wrote in Tuesday's post. ""But it's also clear that the culture and approach that got Uber where it is today is not what will get us to the next level.""

 How Salesforce-Google will help buck Amazon   
 6:58  PM ET Tue,  7 Nov 2017 |  01:09 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer knows that playing offense and defense at the same time isn't easy, especially for a business.
 ""Yet whenever I speak to a truly competitive company, that's exactly what they're doing — playing both offense and defense using the power of digital, using the power of technology. They have no choice; if they don't embrace technology they'll be left behind,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
That's why Cramer saw Salesforce.com's partnership with Alphabet's Google, which was announced on Monday, as so important.
 The combination would pair Salesforce's customer relations management systems with Google's analytics and cloud platforms, giving clients more holistic ways to view customer data.
Cramer said the partnership would benefit retailers that compete with Amazon and would prefer not to pay for Amazon Web Services for their cloud-based needs.
""You don't pay your opponent when you're fighting them tooth and nail, not if you can avoid it,"" Cramer said. ""The problem has been that Amazon Web Services, with its amazing analytics that works seamlessly with Salesforce, really does give you an edge you couldn't find anywhere else, at least not until this Salesforce-Google team-up.""
The ""Mad Money"" host pointed to Monday's reports of Amazon launching its first two furniture brands, a sign that the e-commerce colossus could be moving into the furniture industry. 
Whether Amazon will make a wholehearted effort to enter the furniture space remains unclear, but furniture stocks from RH to Williams-Sonoma still suffered considerable losses on the news.
Cramer said that Amazon Web Services (which also partners with Salesforce) gives those retailers advantages in telling their stories and reaching new customers.
But if Amazon becomes a direct competitor, paying for its services becomes less attractive, particularly with Google offering a similarly effective analytics and marketing platform, he said.
""It's defense and it's offense. And judging by the declines of the stocks in the brick-and-mortar segment of this market ... it seems like not enough companies in that sector have a digital strategy that is strong on both sides of the field,"" Cramer said.
But companies, especially retailers, with a sound digital strategy now have an alternative to Amazon that could help them maintain their competitive streak against the e-commerce colossus.
""The bottom line is, no matter what the industry, if you own shares in a company that doesn't have not a digital strategy, but a winning digital strategy, your goose is cooked, as the other guys in the sector will set the oven at 500 degrees and burn your stock to a crisp,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.

Aparna Chennapragada, Senior Director of Product at Google, Inc., talks about the new Augmented Reality stickers feature of the Pixel 2 smartphone at a product launch event, October 4, 2017.
 Google expects that ""hundreds of millions"" of Android devices will be capable of augmented reality (AR) uses next year, bringing a slew of potential monetization opportunities.
 Amit Singh, vice president of business and operations for virtual reality (VR) at Google, spoke about the company's investment in the technology and the release of ARCore, a platform that allows developers to make AR apps for Android.
The Google executive expects the use of AR to become a daily occurrence. 
 ""There will be hundreds of millions of phones that will be AR ready. And the current stage is … we are helping developers … build the experiences … so that it becomes a daily habit,"" Singh said Tuesday during a talk at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon, Portugal.
""And once it does, I suspect the natural evolution of monetization comes through.""
Singh talked about the potential to make money from games or even shopping. 
The U.S. search giant expects that 100 million devices will be AR ready by the end of this year, and then ""hundreds of millions"" by the end of 2018. 
When ARCore was released in August it was launched on Google's Pixel phone and the Samsung Galaxy S8. Both are high-end phones. But Singh said he expects that mid-and-lower-end phones to get the capabilities over the next two years.
""Augmented reality (will become) a core feature of most of Android over the next few years,"" Singh said.
AR has become a big battleground for the technology giants, in particular Apple and Google. Apple released its ARKit, a set of tools to help developers create AR apps on its iOS operating system. That is Google's direct competitor. 
Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC earlier this year that AR would make the iPhone ""even more essential.""

 Salesforce on Tuesday revealed its latest progress around ways to translate text from one language into another without human input.
The translation system comes close to being the most accurate there is today by one measurement, and the researchers have ideas about how to improve it.
 ""We want to see it deployed in a lot of places,"" Salesforce chief scientist Richard Socher told CNBC in an interview at the company's Salesforce IQ office in Palo Alto, California.
In recent years, web companies like Facebook and Google have been the ones leading the way in terms of incorporating artificial intelligence into their products. Now Salesforce is among the companies drawing on AI to improve the software that people at big companies use. That could help Salesforce as it competes with the likes of IBM, Microsoft and Oracle.
Salesforce established its AI research lab following its 2016 acquisition of Socher's start-up, MetaMind. The group has doubled in size since then, Socher said. Like many other corporate research organizations, Salesforce Research regularly publishes results of its research and releases code online for free for others to explore. 
In this case, Salesforce circumvented technology called long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) that have become popular for machine translation. Instead, they chose to build on a system called Transformer, which Google unveiled earlier this year.
Translation has been revolutionized by the use of a trendy type of AI called deep learning, which involves training systems called artificial neural networks on lots of data and then getting them to make inferences about new data.
But the neural network-based systems can be slower to make inferences than more traditional architectures, as Socher and four of his collaborators -- Jiatao Gu, James Bradbury, Caiming Xiong and Victor O.K. Li -- point out in a new academic paper. Simply put, their model comes up with the best words for a translation in parallel, instead of in sequential order, which provides a speed boost. 
Bradbury explained some of the team's work with an analogy.
""You have a whole panel of professional translators, and they're all in separate cubicles somewhere,"" he said. ""You want to get a translated sentence, but you don't let them talk to each other. When you ask each of them to output one word, they're not going to make the right guesses about what each other is thinking. They're going to produce something that totally is gibberish. That's the problem that we ended up solving."" 
While Salesforce already offers technology that's based on work from its research lab, machine translation isn't in use in Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or any other product. That could change in the next few years, though.
""I think we'll see especially for technical documentation"" that it can come in handy, Socher said.

 If you get easily hangry and impatient, Google's new feature that lists restaurant wait times will help you plan around your hunger pangs. The update will arrive to Google search and Maps ""soon."" It will show you how long you'll have to wait to get a seat at a restaurant at any particular hour. Google says it'll have wait times for nearly a million sit-down restaurants around the world.
To access the feature, users just search for the restaurant on Google, open the business listing, and a Popular Times section will be displayed with an estimated wait in real time. You can also tap on any hour on the bar graph to see how long the wait will be for that period, in case you want to plan ahead for dinner.
There's also a summary of how long people spend at the restaurant on average, and how long people will wait during peak times. Google says the estimates are based on ""anonymized historical data,"" which is how it calculates wait times for businesses like museums and grocery stores.
 The feature is new to restaurants, but Google previously introduced search cards that show the busiest times for businesses and public places back in 2015. It also introduced the feature to bars last year.

77,2017-11-08,Kroger is using Google and Microsoft clouds to avoid paying Amazon  Google developer explains the pain losing adoption credit will cause  Zebra Medical Vision offers $1 AI medical scans on Google Cloud  Salesforce CEO dismisses Microsoft as a competitor  ,"Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images
A shopper outside a Kroger supermarket in Peoria, Illinois.
 As Kroger moves to cloud computing, the nation's largest grocery store chain is sending millions of dollars to Microsoft and Google.
 But not to Amazon.
""For obvious reasons competitively, it doesn't make sense for us to do a ton to help grow that business for them,"" Chris Hjelm, Kroger's chief information officer, told CNBC in an interview. 
 With Amazon's retail business pushing into more industries and competing more directly with a growing number of companies, Amazon Web Services is starting to experience a backlash. Kroger is joining the likes of Wal-Mart and Target in finding other vendors to handle their massive workloads for their digital and e-commerce offerings. Alphabet said in its latest earnings release that Kohl's has moved to Google's cloud.
In a blog post on Monday, venture capitalist Glenn Solomon from GGV Capital underscored how pervasive this has become. Solomon said several of his firm's portfolio companies that use AWS have been asked by retail clients to ""provide a mirrored service on another cloud because they'd prefer not to have their data stored with Amazon given competitive fears.""
For Kroger, that fear has become more obvious by the day. In August, Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion and instantly cut prices at the upscale grocer. CNBC has also been reporting on Amazon's potential efforts to crack the pharmacy market, another reason for Kroger to be concerned.

 7:11  PM ET Wed, 17 May 2017 |  02:22 
 Kroger gets about 9 percent of sales from its more than 2,200 pharmacies.
Hjelm said the company started investing heavily with Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud late last year. With Azure, the grocer is rolling out digital shelf technology to combine the use of sensors and smartphones to alert customers about relevant deals. For e-commerce, delivery and data-focused initiatives such as smart pricing, Kroger is turning to Google. The company also uses infrastructure technology from Pivotal.
Kroger does have some projects running on AWS for businesses that the company acquired. But for any new initiatives, ""that investment in growth is not going to AWS,"" Hjelm said. Regarding Microsoft and Google, ""we feel like we're not losing anything from a competitive perspective working with those companies,"" he said.
If AWS is worried about Kroger representing an emerging trend, it's not showing up in the unit's financial performance or its market share.
Revenue in third quarter surged 42 percent to $4.58 billion, and AWS produced $1.17 billion in operating income for a company that's used to running with little to no profit. Nordstrom, Under Armour, Lululemon and Nisa Retail in the U.K. are a few of the retailers and consumer brands that count on AWS.

 For cloud infrastructure as a whole, AWS controls 34 percent of the market, followed by Azure at 12 percent, IBM at 8 percent and Google at 5 percent.
According to AWS, retailers will continue to use its infrastructure because they care most about agility, security and performance when deciding where to run their workloads.
""AWS is the clear leader in these areas,"" a company spokesperson said in an e-mail. ""Retailers' end users don't care about any rivalry that may exist with another retailer.""
Like most big established enterprises, Kroger isn't moving everything to the public cloud. The company still has many of its core computing functions and storage in its own data centers. 
But Hjelm said that in the cloud, Kroger has thousands of projects for testing and development running as well as live applications. He wouldn't specify how much the company is spending on the cloud, but he said it's in the millions of dollars and is split roughly equally between Microsoft and Google.
""Over time that balance could shift depending on who creates more value,"" he said. 
Tariq Shaukat, a president in Google's cloud division, said in an interview that even if retailers have been reluctant to give Amazon their money, a lot of them have still historically run on AWS. Google is picking up customers now because its cloud platform finally has the services they need, he said.
""There's an increasing recognition that GCP is a viable option and a leader in areas they care about, like security, data analytics and machine learning,"" he said.

President Donald Trump holds sample tax forms as he promotes a newly unveiled Republican tax plan with House Republican leaders in the Cabinet Room of the White House in Washington, November 2, 2017.
 As House Republicans mark up their tax overhaul, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, adoptive families are pushing back on their decision to do away with a critical tax credit.
 The $1.5 trillion tax bill eliminates a slate of credits and deductions, including the exclusion for adoption assistance programs at work.
Under current tax law, families can claim a credit of up to $13,570 per child to cover qualified adoption expenses, including court costs and attorney fees, traveling expenses and adoption fees. Your credit is limited to your tax liability for that year, and you can carry it forward for up to five years.
 Credits like this one reduce your taxes on a dollar-for-dollar basis. They're more valuable than deductions, which lower your taxable income based on your tax bracket.
This benefit begins to phase out for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income of $203,540.
Meanwhile, workers who are receiving adoption benefits from their employers can exclude up to $13,570 of assistance per child.
Some 63,960 taxpayers filed Form 8839 to claim the adoption credit in 2015, according to the IRS.
It remains to be seen whether the provision remains — and whether the Senate will keep it in its version of the tax bill — but some adoptive families are speaking out on what the credit means to them.
 ""We need $30,000 TODAY""
 Brandon Jones, a developer at Google and adoptive father of two boys, shared in a series of tweets on Nov. 2 just how imporant the credit is to adoptive families.
 Tweet
 It cost the Jones family about $50,000 to adopt their first son, largely due to adoption agency and legal fees, as well as medical, travel and other expenses, he tweeted.
Such figures aren't unheard of. Adoptions from a private agency can range from $20,000 to $45,000, according to the Child Welfare Information Gateway.
International adoptions are even more complex, with average costs as high as $50,000, plus additional expenses for passport and visa fees, translation costs, and more.
 Credits versus costs
 Even though adoptive families need to spend the money before they can claim the credit, the cash they get back helps make them whole.
 Tweet
 This is particularly important for families that tap their assets, including their 401(k), or take out a second mortgage or home equity loan to cover those expenses.
Availability of the credit is a determining factor in whether people will adopt, Jones tweets.

Zebra Medical Vision's founding team including Eyal Gura (right).
 Zebra Medical Vision, an artificial intelligence (AI) health start-up, is collaborating with Google to offer its algorithms on the search giant's cloud.
 The Israeli firm has created AI algorithms to read medical scans and detect anything untoward before humans can. Currently, its software can spot issues such as liver and lung disease and it is working on capabilities to recognize breast cancer and lung cancer.
Zebra recently announced that all of its algorithms will be available to use for $1 per scan. So, each time a hospital uses the algorithm to study a medical scan it will be charged $1.
 But currently, Zebra's software is installed on-site, which can be costly for hospitals having to pay for servers to store the imaging. That's why Zebra is offering its algorithms on the Google Cloud.
Major hospitals and health care systems are slowly moving their data storage to the cloud, which offers a cheaper way to keep large amounts of information. Companies like Microsoft, Google and Amazon offer such services. But these technology giants also provide added services on top of their clouds, such as data analytics and AI capabilities.
Both Microsoft and Amazon have special tools in the cloud focused on areas of medicine such as genomics or drug development. Google has been trying to push the health care side of its cloud platform in the past few months.

 For Zebra offering the algorithms on the cloud could mean the ability to scale its business faster.
""We see two strong trends coming to place — one is the urgent need for more scalable and secure storage for hospitals due to the overwhelming amounts of digital data. The other urgent need is how to analyze this data quickly and accurately to bring value to doctors and patients,"" Eyal Gura, Zebra Medical Vision co-founder and chairman, told CNBC.
""The new collaboration we just announced with Google Cloud will enable hospitals and patients to realize value from both trends.""
It's important to note that Zebra is a customer of Google's Cloud and the two parties are not working on anything together currently for joint customers.

Salesforce chairman and CEO Marc Benioff.
 At Dreamforce two years ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had a prime speaking spot and Salesforce's Marc Benioff touted the blossoming partnership between the two companies.
 Those days are gone. 
On Tuesday, Benioff used part of Salesforce's investor day meeting at Dreamforce to talk up Salesforce's expanded partnership with Google and its growing relationships with Amazon, Cisco, Dell and IBM. 
 But he didn't include Microsoft in that group, even after the companies made a big deal about their work together in 2014 and again in 2015.

 CRM's Benioff: How we're getting around the 'loyalty is dead' problem   
 6:57  PM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  01:16 
 It's a complicated relationship. Microsoft and Salesforce compete in areas like business intelligence and customer relationship management software. Beyond that, Microsoft outbid Salesforce for LinkedIn in 2016, and Microsoft previously tried to buy Salesforce.
This week, Salesforce made some moves of its own onto Microsoft's turf, integrating more deeply with both Google and Facebook.
At the investor meeting, Kirk Materne of Evercore asked Benioff if it would be possible for Microsoft and Salesforce to ""come back together on behalf of customers.""
Here's a transcript of what Benioff said in response:
 No, there's always one person in the room who's using a Surface laptop, so I get that. And it's you. Who else is using a Surface laptop? Raise your hand. OK, we have three people. And how many are using Macs? Raise your hand. How many iPads? OK. How many PCs? And then we've got the three Surface. You know, look. They're 1 percent of the CRM market. You know the numbers. I like having competitors. But what I just get blown away with is how they just can't keep, you know, that management team in place. They just keep leaving Microsoft. You know that. And I think they don't have confidence in that ability to execute in that business. So that has weighed to our favor, and customers feel that. You know because you go to these conferences just like I do. There is no conference like this that they do and that's the — in my opinion, the mark. That is — why is it that they don't have anything like this? That when they put on a conference like something — it's always the resellers who come together, and then -- where are these people? Now, that isn't to say they don't have, like, Build, where they get these really high-end developers using the IDE. You know what I mean? Is that the conference I've been to where I'm like, Oh, yeah, these are all the -- and they're all Windows -- they have a Windows fever. And they have Windows API fever at the conference. But I haven't seen that in any other part of their business, other than the Windows API. Maybe they'll get it in Azure -- I don't know. But I haven't seen that yet. Because the last time that I went to the conference, I didn't see that. I only see that fever around the Windows API. And the Surface laptop. 
Microsoft declined to comment.

 It's not just political advertising bought by Russians that has U.S. internet companies in hot water in Washington.

People unload crosses outside the First Baptist Church which was the scene of the mass shooting that killed 26 people in Sutherland Springs, Texas on November 8, 2017.
 Last weekend, in the hours after a deadly Texas church shooting,  Google search promoted false reports about the suspect, suggesting that he was a radical communist affiliated with the antifa movement. The claims popped up in Google's ""Popular on Twitter"" module, which made them prominently visible — although not the top results — in a search for the alleged killer's name. Of course, the was just the latest instance of a long-standing problem: it was the latest of  multiple similar missteps. As usual, Google promised to improve its search results, while the offending tweets disappeared. But telling Google to retrain its algorithms, as appropriate as that demand is, doesn't solve the bigger issue: the search engine's monopoly on truth.

Surveys suggest that, at least in theory,  very few people unconditionally believe news from social media. But faith in search engines — a field long dominated by Google — appears consistently high. A 2017 Edelman survey found that 64 percent of respondents trusted search engines for news and information, a slight increase from the 61 percent who did in 2012, and notably more than the 57 percent who trusted traditional media. (Another 2012 survey, from Pew Research Center, found that 66 percent of people believed search engines were ""fair and unbiased,"" almost the same proportion that did in 2005.) Researcher  danah boyd has suggested that media literacy training conflated doing independent research with using search engines. Instead of learning to evaluate sources, ""[students] heard that Google was trustworthy and Wikipedia was not.""
 Google encourages this perception, as do competitors like Amazon and Apple — especially as their products depend more and more on virtual assistants. Though Google's text-based search page is clearly a flawed system, at least it makes it clear that Google search functions as a directory for the larger internet — and at a more basic level, a useful tool for humans to master.

 Google Assistant turns search into a trusted companion dispensing expert advice. The service has emphasized the idea that people shouldn't have to learn special commands to ""talk"" to a computer, and demos of products like Google Home show off Assistant's prowess at analyzing the context of simple spoken questions, then guessing exactly what users want. When bad information  inevitably slips through, hearing it authoritatively spoken aloud is even more jarring than seeing it on a page.
Even if search is overwhelmingly accurate, highlighting just a few bad results around topics like mass shootings is a major problem — especially if people are primed to believe that anything Google says is true. And for every advance Google makes to improve its results, there's a host of people waiting to game the new system, forcing it to adapt again.
Simply shaming Google over bad search results might actually play into its mythos, even if the goal is to hold the company accountable. It reinforces a framing where Google search's ideal final state is a godlike, omniscient benefactor, not just a well-designed product. Yes, Google search should get better at avoiding obvious fakery, or creating a faux-neutral system that presents conspiracy theories next to hard reporting. But we should be wary of overemphasizing its ability, or that of any other technological system, to act as an arbiter of what's real.
Alongside pushing Google to stop ""fake news,"" we should be looking for ways to limit trust in, and reliance on, search algorithms themselves. That might mean seeking handpicked video playlists instead of searching YouTube Kids, which  recently drew criticism for surfacing inappropriate videos. It could mean focusing on reestablishing trust in human-led news curation, which has produced its own share of dangerous misinformation. It could mean pushing Google to kill, not improve, features that fail in predictable and damaging ways. At the very least,  I've proposed that Google rename or abolish the Top Stories carousel, which offers legitimacy to certain pages without vetting their accuracy. Reducing the prominence of ""Popular on Twitter"" might make sense, too, unless Google clearly commits to strong human-led quality control.
The past year has made web platforms' tremendous influence clearer than ever.  Congress recently grilled Google, Facebook, and other tech companies over their role in spreading Russian propaganda during the presidential election.  A report from ""The Verge"" revealed that unscrupulous rehab centers used Google to target people seeking addiction treatment. Simple design decisions can  strip out the warning signs of a spammy news source. We have to hold these systems to a high standard. But when something like search screws up, we can't just tell Google to offer the right answers. We have to operate on the assumption that it won't ever have them.

 The upcoming worldwide workforce reckoning that artificial intelligence is expected to bring will happen much sooner than many experts predict, the former president of Google China told CNBC on Monday.
 Kai-Fu Lee, now chairman and CEO of Sinovation Ventures, believes that about half of all jobs will disappear over the next decade and be replaced with AI and the next generation of robots in the fastest period of disruption in history.
""AI, at the same time, will be a replacement for blue collar and white collar jobs,"" said Lee, a renowned Chinese technologist and investor who held positions at Apple and Microsoft in addition to Alphabet's Google. But white collar jobs will go first, he warned.
 ""The white collar jobs are easier to take because they're pure a quantitative analytical process. Reporters, traders, telemarketing, telesales, customer service, [and] analysts, there can all be replaced by a software,"" he explained on ""Squawk Box."" ""To do blue collar, some of work requires hand-eye coordination, things that machines are not yet good enough to do.""
 ""The white collar jobs are easier to take because they're pure a quantitative analytical process""
-Kai-Fu Lee, Chairman and CEO of Sinovation Ventures
 Lee knocked down an argument that the jobs lost will create new ones to service and program AI and robots. ""Robots are clearly replacing people jobs. They're working 24 by 7. They are more efficient. They need some programming. But one programer can program 10,000 robots.""
Besides taking jobs beyond factory floors, robots and AI are already starting to takeover some of the mundane tasks around people's homes. Lee pointed to the Amazon Echo as an example.
""The robots don't have to be anthropomorphized. They can just be an appliance,"" he said. ""The car that has autonomous driving is not going to have a humanoid person [driving]. It's just going to be without a steering wheel.""
Lee said that while economic growth ""will go dramatically up because AI can do so many things so much more faster"" than humans, it'll force everyone to rethink the practical and social impact of fewer jobs. ""If a lot of people will find happiness without working, that would be a happy outcome.""
But in a Washington Post op-ed last month, Lee argued against universal basic income, the idea of governments providing a steady stipend to help each citizen make ends meet regardless of need, employment status, or skill level. UBI is being bandied about as a possible solution to an economy that won't have nearly enough jobs for working-age adults.
""The optimists naively assume that UBI will be a catalyst for people to reinvent themselves professionally,"" he wrote. It may work among Silicon Valley and other highly motivated entrepreneurs, he added, ""but this most surely will not happen for the masses of displaced workers with obsolete skills, living in regions where job loss is exacerbated by traditional economic downturn.""
Lee sees a different plan of action. ""Instead of just redistributing cash and hoping for the best … we need to retrain and adapt so that everyone can find a suitable profession.""
Some of the solutions he offered in his commentary include developing more jobs that require social skills such as social workers, therapists, teachers, and life coaches as well as encouraging people to volunteer and considering paying them.
Lee wrote, ""We need to redefine the idea of work ethic for the new workforce paradigm. The importance of a job should not be solely dependent on its economic value but should also be measured by what it adds to society.""
""We should also reassess our notion that longer work hours are the best way to achieve success,"" he concluded.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai takes the stage during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco on Oct. 4, 2016.
 The Missouri attorney general's office is investigating whether Google has run afoul of consumer protection or antitrust laws in the state.
Attorney General Josh Hawley's office said on Monday that it issued a subpoena to investigate if Google's use of information that it collects about consumers is appropriate and if the company stifles competing websites in search results. 
 Google has largely steered clear of antitrust problems in the U.S. That's not the case in Europe, where the company faces a fine of about $2.7 billion over the display of its shopping ads. Google has challenged the decision in Europe, citing competitors like Amazon and eBay and arguing that its process doesn't favor ""ourselves, or any particular site or seller"" but rather is ""the result of hard work and constant innovation, based on user feedback.""
The Federal Trade Commission has come to rely more heavily on states attorneys general for enforcement. The FTC sometimes comments on state regulations or coordinates a joint investigation, and state attorneys general can bring federal antitrust suits on behalf of a citizen of their state.
Google Spokesperson Patrick Lenihan told CNBC that Google has not yet received the subpoena. 
""[W]e have strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment,""  Lenihan said.

 Tiger Global increases stakes in tech and Chinese internet stocks   
 7:41  PM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 |  00:41 
 Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management hedge fund is buying all the ""FANG"" stocks, except Google.
 In the third quarter, Tiger dissolved its $66 million stake in Google parent Alphabet, a required quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed Tuesday. 
But the hedge fund added to its holdings in the other so-called FANG stocks: buying nearly $500 million worth of Netflix shares, $275 million of Amazon.com and $229 million of Facebook.
 Coleman's fund also increased its stake in Fiat Chrysler by 3.88 million shares, or $222 million, and initiated a $137 million stake in design software company Autodesk.
Tiger also bet on the Chinese internet by initiating new stakes in Weibo — sometimes called China's version of Twitter — and its parent Sina.
The hedge fund also increased its holdings of Chinese e-commerce companies Alibaba and JD.com by 191,000 and 5.38 million shares, respectively. Alibaba reported record sales worth $25.4 billion on Singles Day, Nov. 11, while JD.com reported the equivalent of about $19.1 billion over its Singles Day shopping period, which began on Nov. 1.
The third-quarter filing also showed Tiger held shares of three recent initial public offerings: Redfin, Roku and Argentine online travel company Despegar.com.
Coleman has a net worth of $2.2 billion, according to Forbes.

82,2017-11-15,"This ex-Googler found the healthiest people in America — and now he's selling them life insurance  Buffalo Wild Wings wants to emulate Google, Apple to predict when you'll crave wings  ","Health IQ
Health IQ founder Munjal Shah before his health kick started, and now.
 The day after Munjal Shah sold his company to Google in 2010, he was running when he experienced sharp chest pains. He ended up in the emergency room.
 He was 37 at the time, but hadn't quite kicked an indulgence in sugary treats, like Frosted Flakes, Pop Tarts and cinnamon rolls. ""Honestly, what went through my head is that it seemed so unfair,"" Shah recalled. ""I had the best day of my entrepreneurial life after 10 years of work, and then I was going to die."" 
Shah was worried about a heart attack, given his family history — his father, who moved from India to the U.S. — had his first heart attack in his 40s.
 But Munjal Shah's problem turned out to be an inflammation of the lining of his lungs. Nonetheless, that hospital visit changed the course of his life.
 Figuring out who's serious about health
 While at Google, he started taking classes at Stanford to learn about health and medicine. He cleaned up his diet and lost 40 pounds. And he made new friends, all fellow entrepreneurial types, who had similar health scares and subsequently changed their lifestyles. 
The group eventually decided to quit their day jobs and start a health company. They had no clear business model in mind but were all curious about finding ways to reward people who were committed to being healthy.
First, they had to find them. And that's a lot more challenging than you might think.
Many of us fib to our doctors, saying that we eat better, drink less alcohol and exercise more than we actually do. 
To get around these common lies, the team launched a health quiz, called Health IQ. It features questions that assess how health-conscious a person is, rather than how healthy they claim to be. For instance, instead of asking how much you run, they might ask if you can run an eight-minute mile. Rather than asking if you eat too much, the test will figure out if you understand portion control by checking if you can estimate how many cups of rice there are in a photo. 
The test did a pretty good job of picking out those who were committed to their health. And it went viral. In less than four years, more than 1 million people took it. 
During that time, about 2,000 of those people died. 
And that's when Shah figured out how to make money: life insurance. 
After factoring in things like gender, age and education status, Shah and his team learned that the health-conscious elite — the yoga practitioners, the crossfitters, the vegans or vegetarians, the strength trainers, the cyclists, the controlled diabetics, the triathletes and the marathoners — were far less likely to be among the people who died in this test group. Forty-one percent less likely, in fact.
In particular, it became clear that these people were less likely to die from cancer, which Shah calls the ""blind spot"" in most life insurance underwriting. Studies have shown that those who eat little meat, for instance, have a lower risk of colorectal cancer than people who eat meat most days of the week.  
Shah still doesn't know from his data why the mortality rates are lower for yogi-loving vegans, at least not yet. It might be that they exercise more, eat better, are diligent about removing toxic chemicals from the home, or maybe it's a combination of factors. But for his purposes, it doesn't really matter. Now that he knows how to find them, he can sell them cheaper life insurance. And he estimates there are a lot of them — about 50 million in the United States.
 How Health IQ works
 Shah's company, Health IQ, isn't a carrier like some of the big life insurers you might recognize. Instead, it's a type of broker called an MGA that can offer special rates. Health IQ has deals with 3 carriers — SBLI, Ameritas and Assurity — to get health-conscious people who can pass the test a 4% discount. Those who meet a performance threshold, like running an eight-minute mile, get another 4 percent off.  
 Health IQ
The Health IQ team.
 There's always a risk that people will game the system by cheating or lying, but Shah thinks it won't happen often. Getting a healthy friend to fill out the test, for instance, is akin to insurance fraud. And it's reason enough for companies to deny a claim. 
It's also possible that daily yoga and kale juice will no longer appeal to a person who gets laid off, depressed or has a child. But Shah is betting this won't happen often, as the health-conscious tend to be committed for life. If it does, he stressed that he won't back out of the cheaper rate. ""A contract is a contract,"" he said. 
Health IQ does not take into account things like family history, as Shah thinks everyone should get a fresh slate (his own father, for instance, never got super healthy). He also said that Health IQ will look at traditional metrics like body mass index, but it will offer more leniency for bodybuilders with large muscle mass. One of his favorite anecdotes is that Arnold Schwarzenegger, at the height of his rippling abs phase, would have been considered obese by BMI alone.
In 22 months, the company has helped its customers enforce $5.3 billion in insurance coverage.
Silicon Valley's investors seem to like the idea of rewarding healthy people, which is not surprising given that it's a lot easier than trying to change the behavior of those who are struggling or lack the will. Countless studies have shown that technologies that nudge or coach users into getting healthy rarely work, at least not in the long term. 
But some health experts are concerned that life insurance companies will start getting more detailed about evaluating health, but with fewer protections for policyholders. Life insurers, for instance, can discriminate on the basis of a person's genetic test results while health insurers are barred from doing so.
All of this could lead to privacy issues and penalties for those who can't afford things like gym memberships and Whole Foods. ""Historically I think there has been a bright line between the two, and we may see that line start to blur,"" said Dr. Dan Gebremedhin, a physician and investor with Flare Capital Partners.
Health IQ has raised more than $81 million in funding. This week, it announced a fresh $34.6 million round led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from Charles River Ventures, Ribbit Capital, Foundation Capital, First Round Capital, Felicis Ventures and Western Technology Investments.

 });Source: Buffalo Wild Wings
 Buffalo Wild Wings is hoping to forge a successful turnaround after more than a year of sluggish sales and it's betting heavily on tech to make it happen.
 In October, the company revamped its website, leading to a 20 percent boost in online transactions, but it's not stopping there, the company said.
Buffalo Wild Wings told CNBC that in addition to revamping its online ordering, the chicken wing chain wants to emulate tech giants like Apple and Google to provide its customers with a better eating experience.
 To do so, Brooks Goldade, director of digital experience at B-Dubs, told CNBC that the company is looking to bolster technology that is anticipatory. 
""Anticipatory is really being led by the tech giants, the Googles and the Apples, who are trying to figure out what you need when you need it or slightly before you need it,"" he said. 
Goldade said that Buffalo Wild Wings has already built in some of this technology into its platforms, so that it can change how its customers interact with the brand. 
He said that part of the company's plan to engage with diners is through ""personalization layers"" on its website, which track things like a customers' location. Through this data the company can make customers aware of local deals and target areas with specific sports rivalries.
For example, this Halloween, the company produced a ""scary"" video of a Florida college football fan dressed as a Georgia football fan and had the video appear on its website for users within the area of that rivalry.
While engaging its digital users is a priority for the brand, Goldade said the company will always put the food first. The revamp of its website transformed the ordering platform to focus on convenience, customization and letting diners see the food they are about to order.
Goldade said the brand wanted to ""engage your brain in a way that makes you hungry"" by having large photos of Buffalo Wild Wings' burgers, chicken sandwiches and wings in the online order form.
""I don't want to think about adding bacon, I want to see it,"" he said. 
Goldade said that Panera is the leading player in providing a visual element to the ordering process, noting that the soup and sandwich company provides its diners with images of its food online and through its ordering kiosks.
Like most companies, Buffalo Wild Wings receives a higher check from its online orders, so there is a lot of incentive to boost the number of these orders.
Goldade said that currently more than a quarter of takeout orders for Buffalo Wild Wings' company-owned locations are made through digital channels like mobile and online. The company hopes to see this number increase as its online platforms allow for more customization and convenience. 
The company declined to provide more specific sales information. 
Buffalo Wild Wings has reported negative same-store sales for seven out of the last eight quarters.
The chain has been under pressure from investors for more than a year, including waging a heated proxy battle with Marcato Capital Management. In June, Marcato won three of the four board seats they were seeking in that contest. 
The stock had dropped 34 percent over the past year from $163 a share to $108 a share, before B-Dubs surprised the street on Oct. 25 when it beat its third-quarter earnings expectations.
Shares got another jolt this week following reports that Roark Capital was interested in purchasing the company. Shares rallied more than 26 percent on that news.

 Boston Dynamics reveals new Atlas robot

 A robotics company that Alphabet recently sold to SoftBank on Thursday posted a new video that shows one of its more widely known robots doing a backflip.
While some other robots have been shown performing backflips in the past, Boston Dynamics' two-legged Atlas robot has never been seen doing one. To emphasize the achievement, Boston Dynamics replays the move in slow motion twice in the YouTube video. A blooper is also shown at the end.
 Alphabet acquired Boston Dynamics and other small robotics companies in 2013. In June  2017, Google offloaded it and robotics group Schaft to Softbank. Terms weren't disclosed. Robotics is an area that has been seen as a cost-cutting opportunity for Alphabet under CFO Ruth Porat.
Several academic research groups relied on Atlas to get through the DARPA Robotics Challenge competition in 2015. 
Historically Boston Dynamics team members have been eager to see the comments people make on videos posts to YouTube. ""Omg omg omg omg,"" one person wrote shortly after the Atlas video went online.

84,2017-11-17,Two bills in Congress could impact Google and Facebook ad sales  ,"Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images
Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio
 The U.S. Senate is considering two bills that could, if made into law, dent ad growth at Facebook, Google parent Alphabet and other internet companies.
 As is often the case in Washington, the bill with the lower profile has a better chance of becoming law.
 Goodbye to a key internet loophole?
 That's the bill the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Technology passed and sent to the full Senate for consideration on November 8.
 Dubbed SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, it would take away a key legal defense that internet companies have enjoyed since 1996.
That's when Congress granted a loophole to companies that host internet services on their web sites, which absolved them of liability for content their users uploaded.
That loophole now stands in the way of the SESTA bill launched by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, which has been pushed by advocates for victims of human and sex trafficking.

 Russian-bought Facebook ads could have reached millions of voters   
 4:11  PM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 |  00:55 
 It has the momentum of moral justice, because thousands of women, girls and boys have been exploited and had their lives destroyed by predators they've met online.
Because the legislation launched by Portman, a Republican, deals with the most unsavory underbelly of the internet, few have talked about it — except for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Columbia Journalism Review and other advocates of free speech online.
Those organizations point out that repealing what's called the exemption of Section 230 of the 1996 Telecom Act could have an unintended and dire consequence.
It could cause Google and Facebook to restrict the uploading of legally-risky content to their sites and give them de facto market control over internet speech.
For the companies, that could mean lower sales of the ads that have made them two darlings of growth investors. 
Shares of Google parent Alphabet have surged almost 30 percent this year, while Facebook has soared 55 percent.
 Stop the Russians!
 Portman's bill has gotten less attention than another introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and backed by other Democrats, including Senator Mark Warner, ranking member of the Intelligence Committee.
That bill, which is also co-sponsored by Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, deals with a different exemption enjoyed by Google and Facebook, one having to do with disclosures for online political ads.
That bill, the Honest Ads Act, has the support of more than 30 members of Congress. It would require political ads that air online to have the same disclosures that political ads on radio and TV currently do -- like who paid for the ad.
It's high profile given that executives of the companies — and another from Twitter — were grilled in both houses of Congress earlier this month, after Russian propagandists used those platforms to try to influence the 2016 election.
The bill could crimp revenue growth at the internet companies, since foreign people and organizations would no longer be able to buy ads, and the long list of legally mandated disclosures would make these ads less attractive on mobile devices.
That matters, given that political ad sales have grown sharply, based on a report from Borrell and Associates. 
Yet its chances of passage are further away than those for Portman's bill.
Of the 33 members of Congress who sent a signed comment to the election commission backing new rules, not one was a member of the GOP majority.
The Klobuchar bill, introduced in October, sits with the Senate rules committee and has not been put to a committee vote, let alone cleared one, as Portman's bill has.
Neither bill is a sure thing, given that Google over the last two years has been among the largest U.S. corporate spenders on lobbying.
Yet of the two pieces of legislation, the one backed by Portman and headed for the full Senate already, is more likely to impact investors first.
Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified a bill co-sponsored by Senators Klobuchar and Warner. The Honest Ads Act was introduced Oct. 19.

 Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban believes Facebook and Alphabet's Google unit will be ""big losers"" of the Department of Justice's decision to sue to block the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner.
 In a tweet Monday, Cuban said, ""Their media advertising, content and distribution dominance will be a defense at trial. That could create bigger issues for them.""
 Mark Cuban tweet
 The Justice Department on Monday sued to block AT&T's $85 billion merger deal with Time Warner,calling it an ""illegal"" combination that harms consumers and stifles innovation, officials said.
AT&T and Time Warner announced their merger agreement last year, but the closing has been dragged out by the government's antitrust review.
A Justice Department official told reporters on Monday that the merger would raise prices for consumers and potentially block creators of media content from distributing their product without paying more money. Time Warner owns various networks in addition to CNN, including TBS, TNT and Cartoon Network. It also has lucrative sports broadcasting deals.

 ""And why? Well, think about what it requires. You have to walk into a situation, you have to assess where things are, you have to identify everything, you have to remember where it goes, you have to move it in an appropriate way and you have to do all this in some manner of real time.""
In the immediate future, it's more likely artificial intelligence will help your doctor make better decisions, says Schmidt.
""Right now, the technology of artificial intelligence machine learning is largely very powerful pattern-matching. The impact that it's going to have on society is probably first and most importantly felt in health care,"" says Schmidt.
""Think about what doctors do: A lot of doctors are using intuition and their eyes, literally examining what they see, reasoning, looking at patterns and so forth. Those abilities that humans have are very well augmented.
""This is a case of doctor plus, not doctor minus, doctor plus, these kinds of systems. So for the next five years, that's going to be the big narrative.""

""My hope, by the way, is in 10 years, 15 years, you'll have — and this, I think, is the optimistic view — is that you'll have physicists who'll ask the computer a deep physics question, and while they're sleeping, the computer will do an analysis of all of the papers, read them all, and come up with some other scenarios for the physicist to start to think about.""

Some, like tech leader and boss Elon Musk, believe acceleration of automation will put so many people out of work that the government will have to pay people cash to live.
But the Alphabet boss says that robots and artificial intelligence will change jobs, not replace them.
""I think it's pretty evident that the technologies that I'm talking about, at least for the foreseeable future, replace tasks, not jobs. And so it's not obvious that there are fewer jobs. There are in fact, many more jobs. And while we can identify a job that's lost, we can also identify a much larger number, in my view, of jobs that are created because of greater efficiency, greater interconnection and so forth and so on. I'm a jobs optimist in that regard.""

A representative from Panasonic holds the Panasonic Eluga U smartphone, using the latest Android Kitkat operating system, during its launch in New Delhi, India.
 Google is ending a practice in which certain Android cellphone location information was captured, following an online investigation that raised questions about how the information might impact your privacy.
The report, posted in  Quartz, states that software on Android phones gathers location data and sends it back to Google, even if you've actively turned off location settings on your phone, haven't used any apps, or even if you haven't inserted a SIM card from your carrier. The phone would have to be connected to the Internet.
Android phones have been collecting the addresses of nearby cellular towers since the beginning of the year, Quartz said, giving Google access to location information that goes ""far beyond a reasonable consumer expectation of privacy.""
 Google said it chose to end the practice right after the Quartz report was brought to its attention.
In a rather technical statement emailed to USA TODAY, Google offered an explanation: ""To ensure messages and notifications are received quickly, modern Android phones use a network sync system that requires the use of Mobile Country Codes (MCC) and Mobile Network Codes (MNC). In January of this year, we began looking into using Cell ID codes as an additional signal to further improve the speed and performance of message delivery.""
Android phones regularly ping Google's servers using a system known as Firebase Cloud Messaging.

The Cell ID codes, generally a unique number that identifies a cell tower, is one variable, among many, that can be used to determine a device's location.
Google said that the Cell ID codes were never stored in its network sync system, ""so that data was immediately discarded.""
Nevertheless, Google states that it is no longer requesting such Cell ID codes. Google is still using the other codes, MCC and MNC, because they ""provide necessary network information for message and notification delivery."" Google added that these codes are distinctly separate from Location Services, which provide a device's location to apps.""
Google does reach out to advertisers who want to target customers based on their geographic whereabouts, through the company's online AdWorks advertising program. Google can determine location through data collected via GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or in some instances a cell tower.

 });Drone racing is a  booming business. So who makes a better drone racer? A robot or a human?
 NASA tested exactly that on October 12 and Tuesday announced the results of the competition: The world-class drone pilot was faster but the autonomous drone was more consistent.
 Drone pilot Ken Loo was brought in by the team at NASA to race against the artificial intelligence-powered drone. Loo averaged 11.1 seconds for the drone loop while the autonomous drone averaged 13.9 seconds. 
 But the course was tricky. ""This is definitely the densest track I've ever flown,"" says Loo in a statement released by NASA. ""One of my faults as a pilot is I get tired easily. When I get mentally fatigued, I start to get lost, even if I've flown the course 10 times.""
Indeed, the AI drone was steadier, says NASA.

 ""We pitted our algorithms against a human, who flies a lot more by feel,"" says Rob Reid, the project's task manager, in the written statement. ""You can actually see that the A.I. flies the drone smoothly around the course, whereas human pilots tend to accelerate aggressively, so their path is jerkier.""

NASA built autonomous drones to race a world-class human drone racer.
 The NASA researchers who built the robot drone work at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Google paid for two years of autonomous drone research at NASA and the race was the culmination of that.
Of course, developing autonomous drone technology is good for more than just racing. Such drones will be able to check on inventory in warehouses, help search and rescue operations in a disaster and potentially help robots navigate a space station.
The NASA team built three drones (with fly names: Batman, Joker and Nightwing) and programmed them with algorithms, so that the drones would be able to fly quickly without running into objects.
""One day you might see them racing professionally!"" says Reid.

87,2017-11-24,A fake Amazon ad tried to scam users before Black Friday  ,"Simon Dawson | Bloomberg | Getty Images
An employee walks over a logo at an Amazon.com fulfillment center.
 A fake advertisement that looked like a legitimate link to Amazon was visible in Google search results on Thursday, just ahead of the Black Friday shopping frenzy.
 The advertisement, first spotted by CBS News, appeared if a user typed ""Amazon"" into Google Search. It looked like a normal ad but, when clicked, it routed users to a Facebook page and tried to trick users into thinking their computer might be infected with malware.
A message that appeared to be an official notification from Microsoft then suggested that a user's financial data may have been compromised and to call a support number.
 CBS said scammers answered the faux support number and claimed to work for Microsoft before asking for $150 to rid the computer of a virus that didn't exist. People who may have fallen for this scheme could have put their personal information, including credit card numbers, at risk.
Microsoft doesn't ask for this sort of information over the phone.
""We do not send unsolicited email messages or make unsolicited phone calls to request personal or financial information or fix your computer,"" Microsoft's privacy page says. ""If you receive an unsolicited email message or phone call that purports to be from Microsoft and requests that you send personal information or click links, delete the message or hang up the phone.""
A Google spokesperson told CNBC that the ad was an ""abuse of our platform.""
""We strictly prohibit advertising of illegal activity and have removed these ads and suspended the account,"" the spokesperson said. ""When we find ads that violate our policies, we take immediate action to disable the offending sources.""

88,2017-11-27,'Buy bitcoin with credit card' is on the rise on Google and sparking bubble fears  ,"show chapters
 Google searches for bitcoin are soaring   
 12:28  PM ET Tue, 28 Nov 2017 |  01:13 
 The quest to find whether cryptocurrency bitcoin is in a bubble could be found on search engines, where one bubbly sounding term is on the rise.
 Google Trends says the search term ""buy bitcoin with credit card"" is around its historic peak, notes Nick Colas, co-founder of Data Trek Research and the first Wall Street analyst to take the digital currency seriously.
While the phrase is only about 3 percent of all bitcoin searches, it is on the rise.
 The popularity and curiosity of using leverage to get in on the action come as bitcoin's price continues to scale new heights.  In another surge to the upside Monday, bitcoin rose past $9,600 in morning trade, a rise of nearly 7 percent in a 24-hour period and 17.5 percent over the past week alone. It later was trading around $9,500.
""These bubbles tend to end in tears,"" Citadel hedge manager Ken Griffin told CNBC in an interview Monday.
 trends.embed.renderExploreWidget(""TIMESERIES"", {""comparisonItem"":[{""keyword"":""buy bitcoin with credit card"",""geo"":"""",""time"":""today 12-m""}],""category"":0,""property"":""""}, {""exploreQuery"":""q=buy%20bitcoin%20with%20credit%20card&date=today 12-m"",""guestPath"":""https://trends.google.com:443/trends/embed/""});  
 Colas sees the inclination to use credit to get in on the moves of a volatile asset as ""a cautious note"" about where sentiment is running. 
""For those readers who think about transmission mechanisms between financial assets and the real economy, look no further. This is it,"" he said in his daily note for clients.
Other search trends show that bitcoin holds a solid lead in Google quests for digital currencies, even though it has a growing list of competitors. In all, 15 cryptocurrencies now have market valuations above $1 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. At $162.4 billion, bitcoin is more valuable than the next 70 or so competitors combined.
Colas said bitcoin ""still holds a strong lead in terms of global attention in crypto-land.""
Bitcoin also has come in from the shadows in terms of the attention it's getting on Wall Street. Investing heavyweight Michael Novogratz, head of Galaxy Investment Partners, thinks bitcoin will hit $10,000 before the end of the year, and Tom Lee at Fundstrat has a mid-2018 price target of $11,500, nearly double what it was in mid-August.
But Mitchell Goldberg, head of ClientFirst Strategy, told clients he's skeptical and sees the bitcoin craze as analogous to the dot-com bubble and a sign that ""we've entered the final and stupidest part of the bull market.""

89,2017-11-28,Top Google recruiter: The most important skill you should have to score a position at the company  Google has a new site for tracking your investments  Google searches for bitcoin are soaring  ,"Getting a job at Google is no easy feat. In fact, you'd have a better shot at getting into an Ivy League like Harvard or Yale than scoring a position at the tech giant.
 The sheer number of applicants should come as no surprise considering that Google consistently takes the top spot for companies people are most excited to work for.
So how can you get your foot in the door and bring yourself one step closer to becoming a Googler? Highlight an important skill on your resume and in interviews: your problem-solving ability.
 That's according to Lisa Stern Haynes, the global staffing lead and senior recruiter at Google. In a  Google Partners podcast, the HR veteran reveals the four fundamental skills you must have to get hired at the tech company: General cognitive ability, leadership, ""Googliness"" and role-related knowledge.
Out of those four, she says in the podcast, the most important is general cognitive ability. The least important? Role-related knowledge. Yet all four attributes are necessary to snag a Google position, says the recruiting head, so let's break down what each skill entails.

 });
 Haynes says that general cognitive ability is really just problem-solving. ""How do you work through a problem that you haven't encountered before?"" she asks.

 Leadership, she says, is something that Google looks for both in individual, low-level contributor roles and in managerial positions. That means ""being able to influence others and inspire followership for your ideas,"" says the recruiter.
""Googliness"" deals with culture. In looking to see if you have ""Googliness,"" the company pays attention to how you might fit into its culture. Haynes says that Google ""really values collaboration, and working well in teams and navigating ambiguous situations.""
In a nutshell, show that you have a bias toward taking action to a problem and appreciating diversity, she says. These characteristics illustrate how compatible you are with Google's ideals.
Finally, the tech giant looks at role-related knowledge, which she defines as the skills and experience that are needed to perform in a given role.
Out of all four attributes, your problem-solving ability is valued much more highly than your ability to do well in a set role, according to the senior recruiter.
""The idea behind that is if you're a smart problem-solver and you're good at learning, you can figure out pretty much anything that's going to be role-related knowledge on the job,"" says Haynes.
She further explains that Google employees generally hop from position to position within the company, so having overall knowledge is much more favorable.
""There's a lot of musical chairs with regards to people's jobs at Google,"" says the lead recruiter. ""So we want to hire smart generalists who can grow and move around the company over time.""

90,2017-11-29,Andy Rubin takes leave from Essential as probe into 'inappropriate' Google relationship goes public: Report  ,"Corbis Historical | James Leynse | Getty
Andy Rubin of Essential
 Essential founder and CEO Andy Rubin has taken a leave of absence from his new company for ""personal reasons"" following a report on the circumstances of his 2014 departure from Google.
According to The Information, Rubin left Google shortly after an investigation found that he had maintained an ""inappropriate relationship"" with a woman who worked under him and filed a complaint to HR.
The nature of that relationship isn't detailed in the report, and Rubin's spokesperson Mike Sitrick denies the connection. ""Any relationship that Mr. Rubin had while at Google was consensual,"" Sitrick tells The Information. ""Mr. Rubin was never told by Google that he engaged in any misconduct while at Google and he did not, either while at Google or since."" Rubin is said to have told Essential employees of his leave of absence on Monday after The Information informed Sitrick of its story.
 The woman who filed the complaint reportedly worked in the Android division run by Rubin, which would make any personal relationship between the two violate Google policy; the company requires employees to disclose such relationships so that one of them can be moved to another division. Rubin left the Android department in March 2013 to lead Google's efforts in robotics, but the HR investigation is said to have taken place in 2014. That investigation, according to The Information, concluded that ""Rubin's behavior was improper and showed bad judgement.""
Rubin founded Danger, the company behind the T-Mobile Sidekick, and co-founded Android before it was bought out by Google. Essential, his new company, is an attempt to build out an  ecosystem of premium hardware products, but its first launch appears to have been a flop — the  otherwise well-received Essential Phone has seen  heavy discounts in recent weeks.
Essential representatives haven't yet responded to The Verge's requests for comment.

Now, the tech giant is being creative and rethinking the way it finds top talent.
 In a  Google Partners podcast from June, global staffing lead and senior recruiter Lisa Stern Haynes says that the company uses ""structured interviewing"" to determine who gets hired.
""That just means we use the same interview methods to assess candidates who are applying for the same job,"" she says.
 Unlike a typical interview where questions change based on the applicant, the resume, the interviewer and other factors, Google determines well ahead of time what questions each candidate will be asked. The company then comes with up a grading rubric to match.
""So way before we ask any questions, we can anticipate what we think a good versus a mediocre versus a poor answer is going to look like,"" says Haynes. ""It makes assessing candidates so much easier and so much more consistent.""

 });
 It also allows HR personnel and managers to determine who will be successful in the chosen role. And the company has research to back up these claims.
""The research has shown externally to Google that structured interviews are more predictive of a candidate's future performance on the job compared to unstructured interviews,"" says the senior recruiter. Internal studies within the company have also found that structured interview scores are highly predictive indicators of future performance scores of their employees, according to Haynes.
So what questions are asked? Well, before developing their interview questions, Google execs think about two key components: What attributes it's seeking from people who join the company and then for that specific role.
But it wasn't always this way, admits Haynes, while also noting that it's definitely been a trial and error process over time.

 Suzy Welch: The one interview question I always ask   
 1:14  PM ET Fri, 24 Feb 2017 |  00:59 
 ""We learned our lesson the hard way after years and years of asking brain teaser questions like 'how many golf balls can you fit in a school bus?'"" she says. ""The brain teasers that we used to ask candidates had literally nothing to do with the job at all.""
One of her favorite questions that she would often hear is ""what would you do if you had an elephant?""
""So great cocktail party conversation but unsurprisingly those types of questions don't turn out to be terribly predictive of future performance on the job,"" she says in the podcast.
Nowadays, their questions fall into two categories: behavioral and hypothetical.
The behavioral questions focus on your past experience and usually start something like, ""tell me about a time.""
""The premise of those types of questions is that a candidate's past experience is going to be a great indicator of their potential future work performance,"" Haynes explains.
Hypothetical questions are a bit harder to prepare for, says the recruiter. ""They're more situational in nature and so you can't rely on past work experience to answer those.""
These questions usually start with ""imagine that you encountered X situation. How would you go about Y?""
In order to score well on these questions, candidates have to be able to think on their feet and walk through their thought processes regarding how they'd go about solving that problem.
""The candidates are not necessarily trying to drive toward a correct answer interviewers are looking for,"" says Haynes, ""but the interviewers are really curious to see how they think.""

 Google Cloud has a new COO, and her name is Diane Bryant   
 4:03  PM ET Thu, 30 Nov 2017 |  00:56 
 Diane Bryant is joining Google Cloud as its new chief operating officer.
 Google Cloud boss Diane Greene made the announcement through a blog post on Thursday.
Bryant is an experienced tech executive who spent more than 25 years at Intel. Most recently, she led Intel's data center group, and was considered one of the top three execs at the company. But she abruptly stepped down from her role at Intel in May due to ""family matters.""
 At the time, Intel said her departure would be temporary for six to eight months. But according to a new SEC filing by Intel, Bryant notified Intel that she will not be returning and plans to retire from the company effective Dec. 1. Intel will have to make a separation payment of $4.5 million to Bryant, the filing said.
Bryant also sits on the boards of United Technologies, and is generally considered one of the highest-profile female leaders in Silicon Valley.

 });T. Rowe Price, Temasek and Campbell's Soup are among the investors in a new round for Farmer's Business Network, agriculture's answer to Alibaba. 
 Founded by CEO Amol Deshpande, a former venture investor with Kleiner Perkins, FBN started as a kind of professional social network for farmers. It told CNBC it raised $110 million in this round of funding. (Google's venture arm GV was an early investor and participated in this round.)
Today, the company operates an online marketplace that helps farmers lock in fair prices on seeds, fertilizers and other costly ""inputs"" they use to grow healthy crops, as well as sell their crops to buyers.
 On FBN, farmers can also share information, anonymously, about what's working in the field or not, and what they paid for various supplies. While they used to discuss these matters at old-fashioned barn raisers and other community meetings, FBN provides agronomists with connections to peers who aren't simply their neighbors.
Since it was founded in 2014, FBN has amassed a veritable gold mine of data on what farmers need and buy and which products have been most effective, whether they're generic or expensive name-brand products.
This now helps farmers avoid overspending. In the future, it will enable them to use FBN for data analytics online, in other words, software that can help them forecast more accurately and optimize their crops.
According to FBN's co-founder, VP of Product Charles Baron: ""The ways in which farmers do business had not been touched by e-commerce and social networks like other consumer industries before. But their work is so full of risks from weather to commodities pricing.""
Farmers and ranchers take home a measly 16 cents out of every dollar spent on food each year in the U.S., according to the American Farm Bureau Foundation — slim margins.
The funding round was led by T. Rowe Price Associates and Temasek. Earlier backers also re-upped their investments in FBN. They include: Acre Venture Partners, a fund that invests on behalf of Campbell Soup; Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers; GV (Google's venture arm); and DBL Partners. 
The new investment brings FBN's total capital raised to about $195 million. Baron said FBN plans to use the money to expand geographically, and into livestock. A large percentage of farmers growing row crops in the U.S. are also ranchers. The company is working with some 5,000 growers today, and has 200 full-time employees.

Nest Thermostat
 Alphabet is thinking about bringing Nest Labs — maker of the Nest smart thermostat and other home products — back under its Google hardware umbrella, The Wall Street Journal said Wednesday.
 Nest is currently owned by Alphabet but is operated under Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" product category instead of directly under Google. The company is best known for its line of smart thermostats, but also sells connected cameras, a smoke alarm and a CO2 detector.
While Nest was relatively quiet in recent years, it launched several new products in 2017, including new Nest IQ models of its connected cameras, a more affordable Nest Thermostat E and the Nest Guard home security system.
 The move could help it fight against Amazon, which is encroaching on the connected home space with the Amazon Cloud Cam smart camera and a new in-home delivery system called Amazon Key.
Nest has had its share of ups and downs. In June, Reuters reported that Alphabet was considering a sale of its Nest unit in 2016 for about $3.2 billion. Last year, the CEO of Nest, Tony Fadell, departed the company.
Google has increased its focus on hardware — it now sells smartphones, Google Home smart speakers and more — and bringing Nest back under the same roof will make it easier for the two teams to collaborate.
Google and Nest declined comment to CNBC.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks during Digital Unlocked Google event at Taj palace on January 4, 2017 in New Delhi, India.
 Every month, about four million more Indians get online. They include people like Manju, a 35-year-old seamstress in this city of ancient palaces, who got her first internet phone last week.
''It's necessary for me to learn new things,'' said Manju, who uses only one name. She was so thrilled to discover YouTube and other streaming video services that she quickly burned through her monthly data plan. Now her phone carrier, Reliance Jio, has relegated her to a trickle of low-speed data until next month, when her plan resets.
''It's all finished,'' she complained on Monday when a Google researcher came to visit to ask about her online habits.
 Google, which missed out on the rise of the internet in China, is determined not to make the same mistake in India. It has marshaled some of its best developers, designers and researchers to figure out how to adapt or completely rethink products like YouTube to serve the needs of mobile internet users with smaller budgets but big aspirations.
Many of the world's biggest tech companies -- Facebook, Google and Amazon from the United States, and Alibaba and Tencent from China -- are competing with local businesses like Reliance, Flipkart and Paytm to win their loyalties. With 1.3 billion people, only one-third of whom are currently online, India has huge moneymaking potential for the services that secure a foothold.
At an event on Tuesday in New Delhi, Google plans to unveil its most ambitious India-focused product so far -- a new version of its Android operating system and related apps designed for low-end smartphones. The package will include YouTube Go, which allows users to easily download and share videos with their friends, and Google Go, a variant of its search engine that helps users find information by tapping the smartphone screen instead of typing a query.
''We have to figure out how to build the right products for them,'' said Caesar Sengupta, the Google vice president who oversees Next Billion Users, its unit dedicated to creating products for emerging markets like India, Brazil and Indonesia. ''This is a very high priority for Google.''
Many of the new Indian users have basic phones, which make it difficult for them to run certain apps or to store big files like videos. Data plans are limited, and despite a telecom price war that has cut the price of a megabyte of data by as much as 97 percent, some customers are unable to afford more data when they run out.
Google's Android software and apps like the Chrome browser, Maps and YouTube are often included with smartphones. But Facebook also makes products that vie for the attention of Indian consumers and advertisers.
In fact, WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram -- all Facebook products -- occupied three of the top six spots this year when the research firm App Annie measured how Indians spent their time online.
Arjun Vishwanathan, associate director of emerging technologies at IDC India, said that search, Google's core expertise, was ''culturally not that important to Indians.''
''Where Google scores is its ability to keep it simple and keep it convenient while letting the consumer decide what she wants to do without being in her face,'' he said. Google also has vast amounts of data about its users that can be valuable in developing new products and targeting ads, he said.
Google has been serving Indian internet users for as long as the company has been around. But intense efforts to adapt Google's products for India -- and invent new ones to serve Indian customers -- began in earnest in 2015 after Sundar Pichai, who was born in India, became Google's chief executive.
Over the past few months, Mr. Sengupta's team has been releasing new products like Tez, a payments app, and Datally, a data-saving app. On Tuesday, Google also plans to announce that Maps will offer driving directions for motorcycles and two-wheeled scooters, which are common forms of transportation here.
All of the work is backed by an extensive research effort by Google in India and other developing countries to examine how people really use their phones, what needs are unmet and how the company's apps are received.
Datally was a product of such research. When a user opens it, a big screen pops up and shows how much mobile data the person has used, measurable by day, week or month. It also shows which apps are using the data and allows users to block some or all of them. A recent tweak added a feature for finding nearby Wi-Fi hot spots.

Ted McCarthy, a Google user experience researcher, was in Jodhpur on Sunday and Monday to gather feedback on Datally and another app, a voice-controlled virtual assistant that is made to work on a $23 feature phone. He quizzed Indians about their internet use, their habits, even how they commuted to work, collecting information to take back to the team.
One of the interview subjects, Deepika Panwar, 22, works in a bookkeeping job while trying to start a clothing and jewelry business. Most of her salary, Ms. Panwar said, goes to her parents to help support her younger brother and sister. She spends 179 rupees a month, or about $2.77, for a cellphone line with one gigabyte of data.
She said her monthly data pack was often gone in 15 days as she browsed YouTube for fashion videos, used WhatsApp or surfed the web.
When Mr. McCarthy showed her Datally, Ms. Panwar quickly grasped what it was about. ''It is showing me what each application is doing,'' she said. ''It will be a great help to me.''
The interviews confirmed to Mr. McCarthy that Datally's fundamental premise was sound: The tool would be useful to people with data constraints. But they also revealed a couple of problems. The app's Wi-Fi finder had few public hot spots to suggest. And the technical language on the sign-up screen -- with a warning that the app was creating a virtual private network to monitor network traffic -- stymied potential users.
On Monday, Mr. McCarthy visited Manju and showed her the Google Assistant on her new Reliance Jio feature phone. The app allows her to speak commands to the phone in Hindi or English.
Language has been a particular barrier for internet adoption in India. The voice-driven assistant has been very popular in India, with 28 percent of all Google searches conducted by voice.
At first, the app had trouble understanding her. But before long, she had it answering her questions.
''I just say it, and it's there,'' she said.

 YouTube cutting access to Amazon FireTV on January 1st: Report   
 3:56  PM ET Tue,  5 Dec 2017 |  01:38 
 Amazon and Google aren't playing nice over the holidays.
 On Tuesday, Google said that it's pulling YouTube from Amazon's streaming devices, the FireTV and Echo Show. It's the latest adversarial move in an increasingly thorny relationship between the two tech giants, which are going head-to-head in hardware, content, cloud services and even digital advertising. 
YouTube will be off Amazon's devices starting Jan. 1, meaning consumers in the market for a streaming gadget over the holidays may instead choose one from Roku, Apple or Google. A Google spokesperson attributes the cut-off to a ""lack of reciprocity"" from Amazon.
 The e-commerce giant has long refused to sell many of Google's hardware products, including its Chromecast streaming device, Home smart speaker and, more recently, its Nest security offerings (though one version of its Nest thermostat is still for sale). Amazon also doesn't make its Prime Video content available to Chromecast users.

Susan Wojcicki, chief executive officer of YouTube Inc., introduces the company's new television subscription service.
 As Google and Amazon are in an intensifying battle for the living room, they're also competing for enterprise users moving to the cloud. The Google Cloud Platform has continued to release a slew of new products aimed at capturing market share from industry leader Amazon Web Services and has won cloud business from the likes of Kroger, which told CNBC last month that it doesn't want to fund its retail competitor.
While the cloud rivalry is leading to more services and lower prices for businesses, the disconnect on the consumer device and content side is bad for consumers. Instead of having one product with all their favorite content, they have to make a choice.
Investors in the world's two most valuable internet companies certainly aren't suffering. Alphabet has surged 29 percent this year and Amazon is up 52 percent. For Amazon, that leap has made CEO Jeff Bezos the richest person in the world, with a total net worth of more than $96 billion.
""We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon,"" the Google spokesperson said. 
An Amazon spokesperson issued a statement saying that Google is setting a ""disappointing precedent"" and returned the call for a resolution:
""Echo Show and FireTV now display a standard web view of YouTube.com and point customers directly to YouTube's existing website. Google is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website. We hope to resolve this with Google as soon as possible.""

Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene.
 Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood was complimentary of Google's cloud computing unit on Tuesday, and had particularly flattering words for CEO Diane Greene.
 Speaking at the 2017 Wells Fargo Tech Summit in Utah, Hood said that Microsoft has been seeing Google's rival cloud more frequently in a competitive setting.
Microsoft's Azure cloud service and Office 365 cloud-based productivity apps are in a high-stakes battle with the Google Cloud Platform and G Suite. In the public cloud business, both Microsoft and Google trail market leader Amazon Web Services.
 In her Tuesday remarks -- which came after Wells Fargo analyst Philip Winslow specifically asked about Google -- Hood also praised Greene, the head of Google's cloud efforts for the past two years. Greene, who was formerly CEO of VMware, announced last week that she hired Diane Bryant from Intel to be operating chief of Google's cloud.
""We've seen more of them in the past few quarters than we've seen before,"" Hood said. ""I think they're making a good effort. I think Diane Greene is an excellent leader and an established enterprise CEO.""
Hood went on to say that Greene has ""always been a winner.""

 Hood's amicable tone represented quite the contrast to the war of words of late between AWS and Oracle when it comes to the cloud. Oracle CEO Mark Hurd went after Amazon in October, claiming a workload on AWS could be six times more expensive than on Oracle's cloud. AWS CEO Andy Jassy responded last week saying, ""I think they're a long way away in the cloud.""
In the third quarter, Amazon had 31.8 percent share of the cloud infrastructure services market, Microsoft had 13.9 percent and Google had 6 percent, according to Canalys.
Hood talked more broadly about cloud competition in certain parts of the world and she acknowledged the growth of the Alibaba public cloud. Alibaba isn't among the leaders in the U.S., but elsewhere in the world, particularly in Asia and Africa, it's a different story.
The company is ""well-funded, well capitalized, certainly aggressive."" Hood said.

 To come up with the perfect chocolate chip cookie, Google engineers established the inputs: chocolate, flour, vanilla etc. Google employees would test a recipe, give it a numerical rating and then the system would recalibrate the recipe based on the feedback.
""We did this dozens of times—baking, rating, and feeding it back in for a new recipe—and pretty soon the system got much better at creating tasty recipes,"" writes Golovin.
Once the Google engineers had an AI perfected baseline cookie, they teamed up with Jeanette Harris of the Gluten Free Goat Bakery & Cafe. They added a couple of wildcard ingredients to the mix — cardamom and szechuan pepper — to see what their AI cookie-baking system would do. And the final product had to be gluten free.

 Two months and 59 recipe iterations later, they had, with the help of the Google AI, a new cookie recipe: The Chocolate Chip and Cardamom Cookie.

The future of artificial intelligence is likely to include both negative use cases, as Musk and Hawking have warned of, and positive, as Schmidt has celebrated with the chocolate chip cookie success. Potential upsides of artificial intelligence include increased productivity, medical advances and innovations in the financial systems that have the potential to help low-income users, writes Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. 
""[AI] could be the greatest thing ever,"" says  Sam Altman, a top Silicon Valley tech executive Sam Altman, who is president of Y Combinator. ""I really do believe that, if we could eliminate a huge percentage of human suffering with AI.""
""I also believe there will be down sides. Any super powerful technology is good and bad.""
Other similarly dualistic technologies include fission and social media, according to Altman.
""When we learned to split the atom, we were able to make huge destructive bombs and also very cheap, clean energy,"" he says to CNBC Make It. ""We got Twitter and Facebook, which let us connect with loved ones but also makes us unhappy because we read crap all day. Any really powerful technology has huge good and huge bad.""

 Indian start-ups are looking to beat Facebook and Amazon in their own backyard   
 4:27  PM ET Wed,  6 Dec 2017 |  00:42 
 Many of India's top tech start-ups are establishing a lobbying group to push for governmental regulations to put an end to global companies' continued success in the country.
 The group, called Indiatech, will begin its operations early next year. Chief among its agenda is to coax the government in New Delhi into passing regulations to help local companies dominate the country's internet market, industry sources told CNBC.
The new group represents an aggressive new strategy for a local industry that has been scrambling to compete with global giants — and repeatedly come up short. If the lobbying efforts are successful, they could benefit domestic firms while squeezing out big-name companies like Amazon and Uber from the hugely promising market.
 Online retailer Flipkart, Uber rival Ola and messaging app Hike are among the Indian tech companies behind the new lobbying effort. Local grocery marketplace Grofers, travel booking service MakeMyTrip, online classifieds platform Quikr and VC firms Matrix and Kalaari have also joined the organization, people familiar with the matter said.
""If one of the participating members went to the government with a proposal of this kind, it will not be taken seriously,"" said one source with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity as he wasn't authorized to speak to the press. ""But if an industry lobby body, which represents nearly all of the local giants, makes a suggestion, it will be heard.""
 Stumbling unicorns
 On paper, Flipkart appears to have moved beyond its 2016 struggles to raise money: It  secured $4 billion from a myriad of global investors including SoftBank, Microsoft and eBay this year — albeit at a valuation of $11.6 billion from $15 billion two years ago.
But while Flipkart was struggling to raise capital, rival Amazon doubled down on its India bet by pumping $3 billion into the local operations. The announcement bolstered Amazon's total planned investment in the country, which it entered in 2013, to $5 billion.
The results of that strategy are clear: During the important festival of Diwali, a period traditionally crucial for retail companies in the country, Amazon India surpassed Flipkart in sales for the first time.
E-commerce isn't the only sector seeing a showdown: Other Indian unicorns such as ride-hailer Ola and messaging app Hike are also struggling to put up a strong fight against global rivals, such as Uber and Facebook's WhatsApp, respectively. Those firms, along with others from the U.S., China and Europe, have entered India with huge supplies of capital at their disposal.

Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, at a town hall meeting at Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., on Sept. 27, 2015.
 The darlings of India's tech startups have attempted to put up a brave front by offering lofty discounts and expanding their portfolios, but the formation of the lobbying group shows their new strategy is to seek the government's protection from the global onslaught.
The organization would convince the government to make the ""right policies, and bring to their notice the interventions and some decisions that will help us,"" an executive at one of the founding members of Indiatech said. ""The end goal is to help Indian companies get preferential treatment,"" the executive added, requesting anonymity.
It's worth noting that many of the start-ups seeking protectionist regulation have benefited from international investors. In fact, some of the biggest-name members in the lobbying group — Flipkart, Ola, Hike, Grofers and Quikr — share Japan's SoftBank as an investor.
""Our intent is to work with the government to support the development of the rapidly evolving Internet ecosystem in the country and we hope the organization would facilitate this,"" a SoftBank spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.
Flipkart, Hike and Grofers declined to elaborate to CNBC about the rationale behind participating in the Indiatech group.
 Protectionism
 Calls for the Indian government to intervene and protect local companies are part of a narrative in the making for more than a year. Notably, at a conference last December, Sachin Bansal, co-founder and executive chairman of Flipkart, suggested that the Indian government  should do ""what China did 15 years ago and tell the world we need your capital, but we don't need your companies.""
Also in attendance at that conference, Bhavish Aggarwal, the CEO and founder of Ola, echoed Bansal's suggestion: ""There is a narrative of innovation that non-Indian companies espouse, but the real fight is on capital, not innovation. The markets are being distorted by capital,"" he said at the time.
Their views were met with a mixed response from industry leaders, some of whom pointed out the irony that both Flipkart and Ola have raised much of their capital from foreign firms. Regardless, some say the stakes are too high for government inaction.
""If the government doesn't wake up, it will see Silicon Valley kill off a large segment of its entrepreneurship ecosystem and challenge its leading retail and technology companies,"" Vivek Wadhwa, tech entrepreneur and distinguished fellow at Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering, told CNBC.
""Foreign companies will gather massive amounts of private data about every Indian citizen — even more than the Indian government has. Facebook and Google will have the tools to sway Indian public opinion and affect elections. This is dangerous for any democracy,"" he added, saying he believed the government should learn from China, which he says realized very early on that if it allowed Silicon Valley giants to dominate its internet, they would hurt local companies.
Chinese companies are now rivals to Silicon Valley, and firms like Tencent and Alibaba lead the nation's internet market. Last month, China's Tencent hit a market capitalization of $500 billion.
Along those lines, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of e-commerce and electronic payment company Paytm, recently said in a Twitter post that ""India is effectively letting modern world East India Companies own its Internet.""
Alibaba-backed Paytm is facing heat from services by global companies. Its wallet application, used by over 200 million users in the country, has seen strong growth of late, but other companies are interested in moving in on the market. Google introduced Tez payments app for India in September, and it has already amassed 12 million customers, the company said. On top of that, Facebook's WhatsApp, used by more than 200 million users in India, is said to be considering plans to integrate a payment option in its app. Paytm declined to comment for this story.
Some warn, however, that replicating an approach similar to that of China could go terribly wrong.
""It is counterproductive to look at China selectively and cherry-pick parts of protectionism we like,"" said Prasanto Roy, vice president and head of the Internet, Mobile and E-commerce Council at the National Association of Software and Services Companies — an industry group set up in 1988 for India's then-nascent software and IT industry.
""Protectionism is a double-edged sword and any attempt at raising trade barriers could hurt more than help India if there is reciprocal action. Keep in mind that the $150 billion IT industry (two-third of it software and services exports) is premised on an open, non-protectionist global marketplace,"" he added.
Eyes are on the government now, but not everyone believes New Delhi would pass new laws to help local tech firms.
""The government wants investors and foreign companies to come to India and create more jobs and opportunities in the country. I don't think the government would take any action to hurt foreign companies in any way,"" said Satish Meena, an analyst at Forrester Research.

 A market in flux
 The recent arrivals of Amazon, Uber and Netflix in India and the aggressive expansions of businesses by Facebook, Microsoft and Google have changed the dynamics of the local market. Those global firms bring some services to the table that no Indian company rivals, but they're even gaining traction in categories in which domestic firms had a first-mover advantage.
In 2015, Flipkart and Snapdeal together accounted for 75 percent of the online retail market in India, according to financial services firm Morgan Stanley. Today, however, much has changed: Flipkart and Amazon India are jockeying to be market leader, and Snapdeal, which recently ended merger talks with Flipkart to no avail, has seen its market share collapsing.
In October, Amazon India announced it had more than 44 percent of total customer share and more than 42 percent of total transactions during the festival of Diwali, citing third-party data from market research firm Kantar. Amazon credited its Prime subscription service, which it launched in India last year, for helping it bolster sales.
 Chart: Amazon India's app recently surpassed Flipkart's app on the monthly active users milestone, figures from 7 Park Data suggest.
Similar is the fate of ride-hailing service Ola, which has been somewhat successful but only by burning capital at a fast clip to keep Uber at bay. It raised $1.1 billion this October from investors including Tencent and SoftBank at an estimated valuation of $7 billion, and it expects to raise an additional $1 billion in coming weeks.
That investment, a source familiar with the matter said, will be led by SoftBank, which plans to bet another $600 million on the company.
Ola maintains its market-leading position in the country, serving in more than 100 cities, but Uber is quickly catching up. Both the companies are trying to boost the number of rides on their platforms by subsidizing the cost of rides.
""We are growing incredibly fast, focusing on the metrics and features that matter the most: reliability, quick arrival times and the best customer service experience,"" an Uber spokesperson said. Ola declined to comment.
Uber India and Amazon India, for their part, have also fiercely slammed the notion that they are not Indian companies. Amazon India is a ""completely India registered entity, and as Indian as any other,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have consistently maintained our support for free support for capital movement. Free flow of capital is not only good for customers but also helps create jobs, develop infrastructure, aids the growth of small businesses and facilitates India's economic development.""
Uber India said it is ""led and staffed by local teams who know their cities better than anyone. We bring global expertise to India, but wouldn't have been able to get where we are today without a local-first approach.""
Uber has invested north of $1 billion in the country, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said at a recent conference that the company is in heavy investment mode in India.

The 2017 Neural Information Processing Systems conference in Long Beach, Calif.
 Chipmakers focused on artificial intelligence are in a race to get their hardware out the door, a theme that's on full display this week at a major industry event in Southern California.
 A little-known start-up called Wave Computing shared exhibit floor space with tech giants including Google and Microsoft at the 31st annual Neural Information Processing Systems conference. 
Wave is showcasing a motherboard sitting inside a glass case, but one key component is missing: a processor. The chip itself will be ready ""very soon,"" Lee Flanagin, Wave's senior vice president and chief business officer, told CNBC.
 Graphcore, a European AI start-up, similarly has space on the floor but doesn't have a chip to show. In fact, the company is even without a board at the conference. Graphcore said in July that its chips would become available to early customers before the end of the year, but the timing has since slipped to ""the start of 2018.""
A well-funded start-up called Cerebras is among other industry newbies with representatives floating around the sold-out NIPS conference.

 Nvidia in the early days of artificial intelligence ramp up: Raymond James analyst   
 9:24  AM ET Fri, 10 Nov 2017 |  00:55 
 There's an expected gold rush coming to AI as engineers demand more advanced processors to handle a flurry of new and sophisticated workloads — like learning to recognize people in video feeds or translating speech into different languages — while also saving power.
Many researchers rely on graphics cards from the likes of Nvidia to implement a popular type of AI called deep learning, but new AI chip companies are luring venture capital investments with the promise of serving the next generation of computing.
Start-ups are facing stiff competition. Google has come up with chips that can work in place of Nvidia's graphics cards for deep learning. Those chips aren't yet available for rent on Google's cloud. Google is expected to talk about the performance of its chips later this week.
 Flo Rida shows up
 And there's Intel, which has a big booth near the entrance to the NIPS exhibition hall. Intel recently announced plans to make discrete graphics cards and paid over $400 million to acquire AI chip start-up Nervana.
In October, Intel said it would ship its first Nervana products before the end of 2017. On Tuesday, at Intel's NIPS party, the rapper Flo Rida performed — and the company used the occasion to show off its first processor, a spokesperson told CNBC in an email. The chip is now available, and Intel is working with a set of close partners on it, the spokesperson said.
Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on the company's most recent earnings call that investors will start to see Nervana chips reflected in the company's financials ""towards the back end probably of 2018.""
Intel rival AMD was nowhere to be seen on the NIPS exhibition floor.

 Microsoft, Google concerned about Broadcom/Qualcomm deal   
 7:46  PM ET Fri,  8 Dec 2017 |  01:48 
 Microsoft and Google are among companies that have expressed private concerns to Qualcomm about a Broadcom takeover, according to people familiar with the matter.
 The companies are wary of Apple's potential influence over a deal, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. They're also worried about Broadcom's reputation of cutting costs rather than investing in new technology, the people said.
Qualcomm rejected a hostile $105 billion bid last month, leading to Broadcom nominating a new slate of board directors for the San Diego-based company earlier this week. Regulators frequently ask for industry input when making a judgment on whether or not to approve a deal. Qualcomm has said it has antitrust concerns about a potential Broadcom takeover.
 Qualcomm has told Microsoft, Google and other companies not to make any public statements  opposing a deal, said the sources. Qualcomm wants to find out if Broadcom will significantly increase its $70-per-share offer before taking a firmer stance against a possible deal, said the people. 
A Broadcom transaction for Qualcomm may improve Apple's relationship with the chipmaker, which currently provides chips used in the iPhone and iPad.  Qualcomm is suing Apple for patent infringement after Apple in January sued Qualcomm for roughly $1 billion, claiming Qualcomm charged royalties improperly. Qualcomm has issued and applied more than 130,000 patents covering, among other things, smartphone technology.
The litigation could result in Apple abandoning Qualcomm for future products. 
But Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan has privately expressed optimism about settling an ongoing litigation with Apple if Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm, according to a person familiar with the matter.
 Why Microsoft and Google would object
 Apple's gain could be its competition's loss. 
In Google's case, many of the phone and tablet makers who build phones on its market-leading Android operating system use Qualcomm processors. Android and its derivatives make up 85 percent of the smartphone market, according to IDC.
Microsoft just announced the first Windows 10 PCs using Qualcomm chips, and it may continue to push these types of tablet and hybrid PCs, which use less power than traditional Intel-based PCs, as it seeks to compete with Apple's iPad. 
While Microsoft and Google are two of the largest companies in the world, neither rival Apple or Samsung in terms of sales volume from either Qualcomm or Broadcom. Still, both Microsoft and Google perceive an independent Qualcomm as being more closely aligned with their interests than a Broadcom-owned Qualcomm that is tighter with Apple.
The companies have also privately expressed concerns with Tan's reputation of cutting costs at the expense of increasing spending on innovation, two of the people said.
Complaints from these third parties could play a role in scuppering the deal. In the press release announcing the proposed buyout, Tan said ""We would not make this offer if we were not confident that our common global customers would embrace the proposed combination.""
Spokespeople for Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Google declined to comment. A spokesperson for Microsoft couldn't be reached for comment.

The Google Home Max speaker
 Google's new high-end smart home speaker, the Google Home Max, is now available for purchase.
 The speaker was first announced in October and is the highest-end smart speaker the company is currently selling. It should rival similar products from Sonos — including the Sonos PLAY:5 — thanks to two 4.5-inch speakers that will offer better sound than Google's other smart speakers, including the Google Home and Google Home mini.
It offers the same functions as the less expensive Google Home, allowing users to ask the weather, play music on demand or control smart home gadgets like lights and thermostats. Unlike the Google Home, it supports an auxiliary input through a 3.5mm jack, which means you can hook up a stereo system or TV. It also supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
 The Google Home Max costs $399 and is available in white or charcoal.

 });Google used to be the main source of referral traffic for web publishers. Then Facebook eclipsed it.
And now, Google is back on top again.
Over the course of 2017, the search engine has become publishers' main source of external page views, according to new data from Parse.ly, a digital analytics company.
 It's basically a flip from the beginning of the year: In January, Facebook provided nearly 40 percent of publishers' external traffic; now that's down to 26 percent. And Google, which started the year at 34 percent, now generates 44 percent of traffic. Parse.ly's data comes from some 2,500 publishers that use its analytics service, including the Wall Street Journal, Time Inc., Mashable and Huffington Post.
 You can point to a number of factors, but there are a few obvious ones to consider:
 Facebook is constantly updating its news feed algorithm and any changes to the way Facebook surfaces stories could have far-reaching effects on publishers. Last year, for example, the social media company  tweaked its algorithm to prioritize posts from friends and family over publishers. Facebook's ""Instant Articles"" feature, where the service hosted some publishers' content directly but promised to send more readers to the original site as well, has declined in importance. There's been a broad move toward publishing video directly on Facebook, which could affect how many links to web stories publishers put on their Facebook pages. Any algorithms on Facebook that prioritize native video over text links could have an effect, too. Google's AMP — accelerated mobile pages — feature, which also hosts publishers' content directly on Google's servers, has become more important. AMP stories — typically from news publishers — are surfaced at the top of mobile search results as ""Top Stories,"" which drives clicks.

 Getting infrastructure right in Southeast Asia could boost e-commerce   
 9:41  PM ET Mon, 11 Dec 2017 |  01:02 
 Digital businesses can't afford to ignore Southeast Asia, according to a new report by Google and Singaporean state investment vehicle Temasek.
 Home to fast-growing economies such as Indonesia and the Philippines, Southeast Asia boasts a massive internet user base that's overwhelmingly focused on mobile. That will push the region's internet economy to hit $50 billion this year and $200 billion by 2025, growing from 2 percent of regional gross domestic product to 6 percent by 2025, the report said.
 Google / Temasek
 ""Users in Southeast Asia are incredibly engaged, spending an average of 3.6 hours per day on mobile internet, more than in any other region in the world ... These incredible levels of engagement have led to a sizable market opportunity.""
 Focusing on e-commerce, ride hailing and overall venture capital investments, the report highlighted just how explosive Southeast Asia's internet economy is.
 Mobile-first platforms drive e-commerce 
 Google / Temasek
 E-commerce sales of first-hand goods will reach $10.9 billion in gross merchandise value this year, up from $5.5 billion in 2015, the report found. Momentum is chiefly driven by mobile-first marketplaces such as Lazada and Tokopedia, where small and medium businesses sell to consumers.
 Consumer demand underpins ride-hailing
 Ride hailing services are expected to hit $5.1 billion in gross merchandise value this year, more double from $2.5 billion in 2015, and could reach $20.1 billion in 2025, the report said.
 Google / Temasek
 Players such as Grab and Go-Jek have also expanded their offerings beyond consumer transportation to focus on payments and lifestyle services, increasing their attraction to customers, the report said.
 Venture capital investments catching up to China
 Google / Temasek
 Between 2016 and the third quarter of this year, Southeast Asian internet companies raised more than $12 billion of capital, up from $1 billion in 2015, the report stated.
Venture capital investments in these firms stood at 0.18 percent of Southeast Asian GDP in 2016, on par with India and narrowing the gap with China's 0.30 percent figure, the report said.

This year, after revelations that Russian-backed ads and fake news attempting to influence the 2016 presidential election were distributed on these platforms, tech behemoths like Facebook and Google have faced increasing criticism for not more appropriately monitoring content.
 So how did this happen?
""One of the problems in the industry is that ... we came from a, shall we say, a more naive position — right? — that illegal actors and these actors would not be so active,"" says Eric Schmidt, the billionaire Executive Chairman of Alphabet, speaking about Google at the  Halifax International Security Forum in November.
 ""But now, faced with the data and what we've seen from Russia in 2016 and with other actors around the world, we have to act"" to remove the content, Schmidt says. 
But the extent of that naivete is debatable. Case in point: It took Google-owned YouTube from 2009 until recently to heed calls to take down videos of jihadist propaganda featuring (now-deceased) well-known ISIS recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki. In part, Google long argued it was a technology platform and therefore not responsible for policing content. YouTube made a change this year so that such content would be automatically removed, according to The New York Times.

 Pressed on the subject, Schmidt acknowledged the problem. 
""[W]ith respect to YouTube for example, there have been cases where people have uploaded either things which violate our terms of service or things which have been used incorrectly. In the case of YouTube, we have very, very detailed terms of service and after a while, we, after enough people mention it, we typically look at them and decide,"" Schmidt says.
""In this case, I think it was fairly clear, perhaps it was overdue."" 
Billionaire LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has a similar take on some founders' early naivete. 
 ""With power comes responsibility. With great power comes great responsibility.""
-Reid Hoffman, Co-founder of LinkedIn
 During a talk with Hoffman at an Anti-Defamation League event in November, Recode tech journalist Kara Swisher criticized Silicon Valley's ""lack of responsibility,"" with such content and ""its tarnishing of the American democratic system.""
Like Schmidt, Hoffman, who knows many of the players, says there wasn't ill intent.
""A bunch of these folks that built these systems didn't actually think about hostile attack on them, didn't actually think about what Russians might do in order to hack in, or trying in their own minds to figure out, okay, How are we as democratic and inclusive as possible, and how do we build the algorithms that way?"" says Hoffman.

""I think all of that has been retroactive. Has been, 'Oh s---, people are putting up skinning cat videos, we should do something about that.' Right?""
Blame it on optimism, says Hoffman. 
""To some degree in the early days with technologists, what it is is a little bit like a Roschach test. If you're an optimist, you see optimism. If you're a pessimist, you see pessimism, and so forth. [Mark Zuckerberg's] an optimist, so the kinds of things in the early days ... Talking about Zuck, look, we can connect people and they can share experiences,"" Hoffman says of Facebook.
""All of these things bringing in the human fabric of life, of seeing other people as people. Seeing pictures of them on holiday, or with their kids and that kind of stuff, that was the stuff that was being discussed. It's all the positive use cases.""
Perhaps Zuckerberg was living in a ""Facebook bubble"" before Facebook. But naivete doesn't excuse the blind spot, admits Hoffman. 
""With power comes responsibility. With great power comes great responsibility,"" he says.

Go player Ke Jie takes on Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo on May 23, 2017, in China.
 Google's popular search service might be blocked on the Chinese mainland, but that's not stopping the company from expanding its presence in the country's burgeoning artificial intelligence sector. 
 Google's parent Alphabet said in a statement that it had launched the Google AI China Center on Wednesday in Shanghai, the company's first facility of its kind in Asia. The center is focused on ""basic AI research"" and will be made up of a team of researchers based in Beijing. 
The center will be headed by Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford University professor who is chief scientist of AI and machine learning at Google Cloud, and Jia Li, head of research and development at Google Cloud AI.
 The tech giant's AI push in China comes amid growing recognition of the country's rise as a major contender in the space. While the U.S. is often regarded as the leading AI powerhouse globally, Goldman Sachs acknowledged in a September report that China was among the countries hot on the U.S.' heels.
With AI talent in short supply, Google's latest push in China is also an opportunity for the company to snap up top researchers in the world's second-largest economy. 
""I believe AI and its benefits have no borders. Whether a breakthough occurs in [the] Silicon Valley, Beijing or anywhere else, it has the potential to make everyone's life better ... As an AI-first company, this is an important part of out collective mission. And we want to work with the best AI talent, wherever that talent is, to achieve it,"" Fei-Fei Li wrote in a statement.

 Apple could fall behind Amazon and Google in the ""post-smartphone era"" due to ""innovation complacency,"" a market research firm said Wednesday.
 ABI Research defines the post-smartphone world as one where new, hands-free interfaces — such as those that use the human voice — need to be developed. This will include more artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality, and virtual reality.
The research company made an assessment of patent portfolios, research and development spend, acquisitions and contributions to open source communities to evaluate and compare 10 major technology players from Facebook to Microsoft and Samsung. 
 It concluded that Amazon and Google will ""lead and drive innovation around smartphones and related ecosystems"" in the next six years.
""This next wave of innovation in the smart device ecosystem will be led by Google and Amazon, as their apparent strength in major growth sectors, notably computer science, allows for a more flexible approach to next-generation user experiences that are essential for creating immersive experiences and brand-new ways of human-to-machine interactions,"" David McQueen, research director at ABI Research, said in a press release.

 11:12  AM ET Fri, 20 Oct 2017 |  03:25 
 ABI's report said Apple will ""lag due to innovation complacency.""
Apple was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. 
McQueen explained that established device makers like Apple, Samsung and Microsoft will be ""followers"" in the new market and are ""not currently as well set up to drive future innovation,"" mainly due to their legacy hardware businesses. But they should not be dismissed because they have a ""major influence on the market"" through brand and market share. 
All of the major technology players are trying to release new products beyond the smartphone, with many focusing on smart digital assistants. Amazon has its Echo smart speaker with the AI voice assistant Alexa built in. The U.S. e-commerce giant has been releasing several different versions of the Echo and has also been integrating Alexa with other products from device makers. 
Meanwhile, Google has brought out a rival product called Google Home with its own smart assistant. And Apple is gearing up to launch its competitor to the Echo called the HomePod, with its voice assistant Siri built in. Samsung has also been trying to push its own digital assistant called Bixby on its new Galaxy S8 and Note 8 smartphones. CNBC also reported in August that Samsung is set to launch its own smart speaker next year. 
Voice assistants appear to be the next big battleground as technology companies look to offer new experiences and ways to interact with devices beyond the touchscreens on smartphones. But winning the market could require a lot of money.
""There will be a requirement for significant investment in the underpinning technologies and technical expertise as well as the creation of 'intelligent phones' that are able to effectively leverage these forthcoming technologies,"" ABI Research said.

 But to even make it to the interview stage you have to ""absolutely nail"" your resume, says Lisa Stern Haynes, the global staffing lead and senior recruiter at Google.
In fact, a poorly written resume is the ultimate disqualifier for applicants, she says in a  Google Partners podcast.
 ""[The resume] is something that the candidate is using to represent themselves,"" Haynes explains. ""And so if there are going to be mistakes on that and you're noticing sloppiness on there, that really is a great indicator of how they'll perform in a job.""

 Spelling your employer's name wrong Referring to the wrong employer Incorrect spelling and grammar of any kind Incorrect formatting Punctuation mistakes 
An HR person who sees any of this on a resume will think ""that is just a reflection of how they will be as an employee at the company,"" says Haynes. ""The resume is something that you have to absolutely nail if you want an interview.""
The senior recruiter admits that you would be surprised at how often she sees mistakes on resumes and just overall poor resume quality.
""I've seen it all,"" she says in the podcast. However, the most common resume mistake that she sees is using the wrong past tense of the word ""lead.""
Instead of spelling the word as L-E-D, she explains, applicants often spell the past-tense version as L-E-A-D. ""This one drives me nuts,"" she says.
Another mistake she often sees is in the objective at the head of the resume. Because it's so common to simply reuse the same resume format, she receives resumes that say ""I'd really like land a job at [enter company name]"" and refer to a different place of employment.
""It's great that people are customizing their resumes but you always want to make sure you have proofread it a million times before you are submitting it anywhere,"" she says, ""and get someone else to proofread it who has never looked at it before.""
Beyond that, she says that often people fall into the trap of making their resumes read like job descriptions. Instead, Haynes says that you should be showing a recruiter the quantifiable, measurable impact that you have had in whatever job you're coming from.

Google's Project Tango prototype phone
 Google is shutting down Tango, the augmented reality platform it launched in 2014.
 Tweet
 On the one hand, the move isn't surprising. Although Tango has been around for years, it never reached mainstream adoption because using its 3D mapping technology required high-tech hardware made specifically to handle it. 
 Meanwhile, Google introduced ARCore, a developer toolkit for creating augmented reality apps and experiences, back in August. ARCore still won't work with any phone, but it will have a much broader reach than Tango. Google said at launch that ARCore will work on up to 100 million devices by the end of the year, and that most Android phones released in 2018 would work with the service too. With ARCore's launch, Tango seemed pretty much dead in the water since the new platform will bring augmented reality to more phones with less hardware. 
Still, fairly recently Google seemed committed to Tango. The company was still showing off the technology this spring, both at its own developers' conference and Mobile World Congress. Representatives said in May that Google's vision was to see Tango in every smartphone and BMW announced a partnership with Tango at the beginning of the year. 
Still, ARCore's software development kit is very similar to Tango's, so although the latter is getting sunsetted, it will live on its predecessor, albeit in a more versatile way.

100,2017-12-18,Pharma company GSK is taking control of Google data to find out more about its customers  The surprising use case that has made Google Wifi one of the company’s sleeper hits  ,"Pharmaceutical companies are seen as experts in health care rather than being at the cutting edge of digital technology, but the industry — like many others — is going through a revolution.
 At GSK, which owns brands including Horlicks, Aquafresh and weight loss product Alli, digital technology is having an impact on how the business operates from human resources to legal. In marketing terms, it's about developing a closer relationship with consumers, or selling direct rather than through retailers.
""The more direct relationships we have with the consumers the better, right? Because (it) enables us to do lots of great things like feeding into the innovation pipeline, so we create better innovation,"" GSK Chief Digital Officer Marc Speichert told CNBC's ""Marketing Media Money"" anchor Carolin Roth.
 It also means working more closely with Google to find out how people are searching for its products, according to Brian McNamara, chief executive of GSK's consumer health care business.
 GSK

 ""We work directly with Google and actually have a deal that we signed with them recently which actually allows us to own the data that we use … (It) allows us to have much more visibility, much more capability and understand how consumers are behaving, how they react to certain messages, how they're searching for our products,"" he told ""Marketing Media Money"".
""We can use those insights and analyze that to help get better at what we do. So I think it's a big opportunity for the industry,"" he added.
When someone searches for a particular health condition or treatment, they may want in-depth information rather than a quick answer, Speichert said, and this is an opportunity for GSK to start marketing to someone.
""There's a perception around people actually want(ing) everything shorter, which is actually not true. I think you need to get them quickly to the passion point (that they are interested in) and that needs to be very kind of immediate and quick.""
""But once you get them to something that they (are) really interested in, they actually want depth. If you look at (search term) 'how do I treat arthritis?' we actually bring them to an arthritis site that isn't very heavily branded as (anti-inflammatory) Voltaren, because we think that it's a great destination where they'll get lots of in-depth (information) in terms of answering that question. It's just the first step of their path to purchase,"" he told ""Marketing Media Money"".
 GSK
 Amazon is said to be getting into the health care industry, but for McNamara it's not yet a huge threat. ""I think if you look at the businesses we compete in on e-commerce, on Amazon, it's roughly 2 percent of the overall market. (It) is growing at a healthy rate but it's still at a relatively low level,"" he said.
""If you're sick in the morning and you need a product, you're probably not going on Amazon and you're probably driving to your CVS or your (U.K. drugstore) Boots,"" he told ""Marketing Media Money"".
Some drugs sell well on Amazon such as weight loss brand Alli, because ""it's a place where consumers (would) really rather shop for that product,"" McNamara added.

 As the biggest tech companies fight to invade your living room, Amazon's Echo product line still outsells competitors, like the Google Home,  by a huge margin.
 But while Amazon is dominating smart speakers, one of Google's hardware products for the home has emerged as a market-leading hit: Its mesh Wi-Fi product.
Little over a year after it first went on sale, Google Wifi has become the best selling mesh technology Wi-Fi system in the U.S., according to new data from NPD Group. The retail tracking company based this distinction on unit sales of routers and mesh Wi-Fi systems between December 2016 and November 2017.
 ""A lot of what's driving people to the product is the ability to be a better parent.""
-Ben Brown, Head of Google Wifi
 Using  mesh networking technology, which has become increasingly popular over the last several years, Google Wifi basically serves to make sure your Wi-Fi works consistently well throughout your house or apartment. By arranging access points around your place, you can kill dead-spots and achieve faster internet speeds.
""It's not necessarily sexy, but it's super useful,"" Ben Brown, head of Google Wifi told CNBC.
Brown has led the connectivity team through the release of its OnHub router to this latest product. He says that one of the unexpectedly popular use cases that surfaced after Wifi launched was how much people used it to curb their bad digital habits.
 Google
 ""We've been so successful in terms of actual quantity of sales because there are a lot of people that are from a non-traditional segment,"" he says. ""We're not just marketing to tech enthusiasts, for sure — we know that from all of our engagement with customers and usage data. A lot of what's driving people to the product is the ability to be a better parent.""
It's turned out to be a key selling point. Google Wifi lets users pause the Wi-Fi access of specific devices for periods of time or  block certain websites. With a few taps in an app, a parent could stop their kids from using their phones during dinner or streaming videos after bedtime.
""[People are] coming to a need they have in the home that has nothing to do with Wi-Fi itself,"" he says.
Other mesh Wi-Fi systems,  like Eero and  Luma, have similar features.
While Google's product is the top-selling, it hasn't wowed everyone.
Although the device received rave reviews from CNET and  others, it earned low marks in  Wirecutter's intense testing of a handful of different mesh-networking kits, ranking poorly in both long-range testing and latency.
On Google's main Mountain View campus, the company has Wi-Fi testing chambers where it continually works out ways to improve its connectivity through software tweaks. 
 Ultimately, Brown says that he sees machine learning and artificial intelligence as the secret sauce already making Google's Wifi product such a hit. But one area where Google's product could shine moving forward is through integration with its smart speaker, the Home. The Information reported  earlier this year that Google plans to release a version of Home with mesh Wi-Fi connectivity built in, and although Brown wouldn't go as far as to confirm the report, he conceded that further integrating connectivity and Google's Assistant is something the team is thinking about.
As of now, Amazon hasn't released any sort of Wi-Fi product of its own, though it did invest in Luma's Series A in 2016.
Regardless of which company a mesh Wi-Fi system comes from, the consumer desire has grown as people are using more smart home products, according to IDC analyst Adam Wright:
""Demand for Wi-Fi mesh networks is also increasing as consumers are connecting more media streaming devices across the home,"" he says. ""Traditional extenders can't keep up with the bandwidth and signal demands.""

 From that date, Chrome will block ads that breach the ""Better Ads Standards,"" guidelines developed by an industry coalition. This means that the most annoying types of messages, such as pop-up ads, auto-play videos with sound and flashing animated ads will be removed.
""Starting on February 15, in line with the Coalition's guidelines, Chrome will remove all ads from sites that have a 'failing' status in the Ad Experience Report for more than 30 days,"" a post on Google's developer blog stated. The Ad Experience Report will highlight ads on a website that breach the ad standards and may identify the issues publishers need to fix.
 Google told CNBC in June that it is working with publishers in a new program called Funding Choices.

 Under the program, when a user with a third-party ad blocker enabled visits a participating site using Chrome, they will see a prompt that asks them to either turn off their ad blocker, or ""pay for a pass that removes all ads on that site through the new Google Contributor."" If they choose to pay the fee, Google will take a 10 percent cut. If they select neither choice, they won't be able to view the website.
Ad blockers are an obvious problem for publishers because if people don't see or click on ads, their sites won't collect revenue. A February report from PageFair said that 615 million devices now use ad blockers worldwide.
Some web pages can feel dominated by advertising and the Coalition for Better Ads announced Monday that it is launching a better ads experience program come January. Publishers signed up to it will ""agree not to use the most disruptive ads"" according to coalition standards, the organization  said in an online statement.

 });Displaying an error on your resume, no matter how small, can cost you your dream job.
 In fact, Google's global staffing lead and senior recruiter Lisa Stern Hayes says that to even be considered for a role at the tech giant, you have to ""absolutely nail"" your resume.
""[The resume] is something that the candidate is using to represent themselves,"" Haynes says in a  Google Partners podcast. ""And so if there's going to be mistakes on that and you're noticing sloppiness on there, that really is a great indicator of how they'll perform in a job.""
 If that doesn't persuade you to take a second or third look before submitting your resume, consider this statistic: 93 percent of HR people say that mistakes on a resume either sometimes or always negatively impact their decision to extend a job interview, according to a survey released by the  Society for Human Resource Management.
Hayes says there are certain errors you must always look out for:

 });
 Spelling your employer's name wrong Referring to the wrong employer Incorrect spelling and grammar of any kind Incorrect formatting Punctuation mistakes 
An HR person who sees any of this on a resume will think ""that is just a reflection of how they will be as an employee at the company,"" says Haynes. ""The resume is something that you have to absolutely nail if you want an interview.""
The senior recruiter admits that you would be surprised at how often she sees mistakes on resumes and just overall poor resume quality.

Google employee at a recreational area
 ""I've seen it all,"" she says in the podcast. However, the most common resume mistake that she sees is using the wrong past tense of the word ""lead.""
Instead of spelling the word as L-E-D, she explains, applicants often spell the past-tense version as L-E-A-D and she says, ""this one drives me nuts.""
Another mistake she often sees is in the objective section at the head of the resume. Because it's so common to simply reuse the same resume format, she receives documents that say ""I'd really like to land a job at [enter company name]"" and refer to a different place of employment.
""It's great that people are customizing their resumes but you always want to make sure you have proofread it a million times before you are submitting it anywhere,"" she says, ""and get someone else to proofread it to who has never looked at it before.""
Beyond that, she says that people often fall into the trap of making their resumes read like job descriptions. Instead, Haynes says that you should be showing a recruiter the quantifiable, measurable impact that you have had in whatever job you're coming from.
""So in other words, is a candidate going to be able to articulate in a resume what they personally accomplished or brought to the table in their role, either relative to the goals that were set for them or relative to their peers,"" she explains.
Being aware of these common resume errors is crucial, she continues, and it's ""really important to make sure that [resumes are] completely buttoned up when you submit them.""

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
 Facebook and Google's dominance in online advertising continues to swell. 
 New data suggests that the two tech giants accounted for 73% of all U.S. digital advertising, according to Pivotal's Brian Wieser in a note to clients, up from 63% in the second quarter of 2015.
That's a significant leap and highlights why many see digital advertising as a two-pony show, with Facebook and Google taking most of the money while other platforms like Twitter and Snapchat fight publishers for the scraps.
 In the face of that duopoly, there's also been increasing interest around Amazon's ad business, which is starting to be  taken more seriously by brands.
Wieser comes to his estimates by looking at new data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau that shows that digital advertising grew 23% in the second quarter of 2017 to $20.8 billion in ad revenue. Wieser estimates that Facebook and Google account for 83% of that growth. 
Rather than using the new data to push investors to buy stock, Wieser recommends caution because he believes that the we're approaching the saturation point when increases in digital ad budgets won't lead to increased sales. 
""Growth rates are remarkable, but also highlight risks around digital media owners – and Facebook and Google in particular – saturating digital media budgets in years ahead, and reinforce our cautious views on stocks in the sector at current levels,"" he writes. 
That's why Facebook in particular has ""become more aggressive in finding ways to capture television advertising budgets,"" like with its new ""Watch"" video offering.

 That's the advice of former Google career coach and job strategist Jenny Blake, who has helped more than a thousand people improve their work lives.
She recommends creating a ""mind map,"" a visual diagram of your interests and goals. Drawing one doesn't take long and could help you figure out the next project, hobby or career change that will make the new year happier and more successful, Blake says.
 ""My favorite way to brainstorm creatively, whether it's about values or setting goals for the new year, is through mind maps,"" Blake told CNBC Make It.
To make one, write down the year at the center of a piece of paper, and then draw spokes with different themes that are important to you. For example, your spokes could be business, personal life, health and fitness, fun, or skill building.
 var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];

 });
 From each of those themes, draw additional spokes to connect the themes to ways you want to improve or experiment in that area. 
 Blake recommends you ask yourself: ""What's important to me about that? And what does success look like?"" 
For example, in ""personal life,"" you could write, ""Meet up with a friend at least once a month"" or ""Take a music class.""
The visual trick works because it helps you see the different ways you can improve, Blake writes in her book ""Pivot: The Only Move That Matters Is Your Next One.""

 ""With mind mapping you are taking pen to paper, going old-school,"" Blake says.  
And if you're like many professionals who sit too much and stare too long at a computer, drawing might actually be fun.
""The goal is to break out of linear thinking,"" Blake says. ""Go broad. Go big. Go sideways, and then experiment to see which of your ideas is most likely to lead to a resonant next step.""

 });Google is famous for its ""20 percent time,"" whereby staffers are allowed to spend the equivalent of one workday a week on passion projects that they believe will benefit the company. The idea is that creativity and innovation happen when people are allowed to experiment. Things such as Gmail and Chromebooks have resulted, according to a Google spokesperson.
 Whether the policy still exists has been debated over the last few years.
But on Thursday, Google announced that artificial intelligence researcher and senior software engineer Chris Shallue discovered two new planets — and it was born of a flex-time side venture. One day, it could even help discover alien life. 
 ""I'm a Google AI researcher with an interest in space, and started this work as a 20 percent project,"" writes Shallue in a  statement from Google. He read about the existence of vast quantities of planetary data NASA had collected via its Kepler spacecraft and telescope, which has taken a photo from its orbit every 30 minutes for the last four years, according to Google. 
Shallue recognized the un-mined information as ripe for an AI experiment.

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 ""Machine learning really shines in situations where there is so much data that humans can't search it for themselves,"" says Shallue in a NASA statement. (The Kepler dataset took two weeks to download and didn't fit on a desktop, according to a Reddit ""ask me anything"" with Shallue.)
 Shallue recruited Andrew Vanderberg, an astrophysicist and doctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin, for help on the project, which took about nine months.
Together the pair used 15,000 NASA data points to create a neural network, or artificial intelligence organized in a similar way to neurons in the brain. It learned to recognize small light patterns indicating the existence of a planet that previous automated and manual tests had missed.
 AI takes on a new mission: planet hunting. See how we used machine learning to hunt for new planets in @NASAKepler data–and actually found one
 To verify that the neural AI was accurate, Vanderberg used it on a set of photos of 670 stars, then compared that to manually sorted results. What took Vanderberg eight hours to complete took the neural network only a few minutes, the astronomer tells CNBC Make It.
Shallue and Vanderberg had taught the system ""how to identify planets around faraway stars,"" says Shallue in the Google statement.
The two planets Shallue and Vanderberg discovered are ""exoplanets,"" or planets rotating around sun-like stars other than the one Earth revolves around. Kepler-90i was found to be the eighth planet circling the Kepler-90 star, 2,545 light-years from Earth. The only other solar system known to have eight planets rotating around a sun is our solar system. The other planet identified is Kepler 80g.
 2/2 So excited to share 2 newly-discovered planets ID'd by Google AI models: Kepler-80 g, and Kepler-90 i -- which is in the first 8-planet system outside our own! Amazing example of how AI can help w/ new scientific discoveries. Next stop, hyperspace:) http://goo.gl/4fuWG2
 ""We got lots of false positives of planets, but also potentially more real planets,"" says Vanderburg, in the NASA statement. ""It's like sifting through rocks to find jewels. If you have a finer sieve, then you will catch more rocks but you might catch more jewels, as well.""
Beyond discovering new planets, this technological development is a step toward discovering alien life, explains Vanderberg to CNBC Make It.
""The main reason we decided to work on this project was to help us measure how common Earth-sized planets in Earth-like orbits around Sun-like stars are,"" Vanderberg tells CNBC Make It. He estimates finding alien life could be possible somewhere between 2030 and 2050. 
 With the discovery of an 8th planet orbiting another star 2,500 light years away, we now have another solar system that ties ours for number of worlds! Learn about the #Kepler90 system:
 Both Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt celebrated the 20 percent project on Twitter.
 AI can even help astronomers discover new planets - excited to see what they'll find next! This is huge…
 Google isn't the only company that cultivates innovation with a 20 percent ethos. 3M had a 15 percent time policy going back to the 1990s, points out Ryan Tate, author of ""The 20% Doctrine: How Tinkering, Goofing Off, and Breaking the Rules at Work Drive Success in Business."" Famously, 3M employee Art Fry invented the Post-it via the flex time, according to Wired.
And other top tech companies regularly host hackathons, where employees are encouraged to create solutions to problems under time pressure. The first iteration of Facebook's Safety feature came out of a hackathon, for example. 
As for Google and Shallue, clearly the sky's not even the limit.

 });In 2009, executives at Domino's reevaluated their business model in light of an influx of customer complaints, such as ""Worst excuse for pizza I've ever had,"" ""Microwave pizza is far superior,"" and, frequently, ""Domino's tastes like cardboard.""
 Since 2010, the company's stock has appreciated 2000 percent, reports The Motley Fool, in that time frame outperforming the tech giants Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.
The Motley Fool's data extends to April 2017, when the value of Domino's stock was $180. Notably, that's lower than it's December value of $185 a share at the time of publication. 
 President and CEO Patrick Doyle turned the chain around so successfully, for one, by heeding the public's criticisms and making better pizza. But, more importantly, he invigorated focus on digital innovation and amped up their delivery service. Domino's now employs more people in their IT department than anywhere else in the company, reports CBS News, and over half of their sales come from digital platforms.
""With Domino's AnyWare, pizza can now be ordered through a variety of platforms, including Google Home, Amazon's Echo, Facebook Messenger, a smart TV, an Apple or Android smartwatch, a connected car, by texting, or by tweeting,"" notes The Motley Fool.

 They've literally made ordering a pizza as simple as tweeting out a pizza emoji.
If that wasn't enough, Domino's also managed to recently land the long-haired ""Stranger Things"" stud Joe Keery as a spokesperson. He's featured in a commercial recreating the running home-scene in the '80s hit ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" Only, in this case, Keery isn't trying to beat his parents home. He is trying to beat the pizza he is tracking on his phone, because you can also do that now.
Domino's stock has demonstrated consistent growth for years, and Doyle is continuously looking for opportunity to grow further, he told the Los Angeles Times, even if it means taking risks, such as when they added voice ordering to their app three years ago.
""That's the sort of thing that's not going to generate a fast return, but that's part of how you stay ahead of the market,"" he said.

It might also help Amazon improve its new Amazon Key in-home delivery system, which does not yet currently work with an alarm system.

 The company's proposal, which it filed late Wednesday night, describes two green-space laden buildings, totaling ~1.04 million square feet, that could house up to 4,500 Googlers. The project also includes 2,085 parking spots.
Google's renderings of the proposed campus include sloping outdoor paths that would allow employees to move between each of the building's five floors: 
 Development would take place in Moffett Park and mark the latest in Google's lofty efforts to make Sunnyvale a greater hub for its business. In 2017, has snapped up about 50 properties valued at more than $1 billion, according to The Mercury News. 
 Google is calling the project ""Caribbean,"" because one of the building is located on Caribbean Drive, and it's part of the search giant's broader vision for Sunnyvale, which includes employee housing. 
""Housing and transportation are two huge issues for the Valley overall, and they are huge issues for Google,"" Google's global real estate chief Mark Golan  told The Mercury News. ""One of the best ways to address this is by creating mixed-use communities that allow people to live close to where they work, which allows for a vibrant community and also helps the transportation.""
Google doesn't expect the Caribbean complex to open until 2021 at the earliest. 
Andrew Miner, one of Sunnyvale's principal planners, tells CNBC that the Planning Department had not yet had a chance to review the application.
 Google's parent company, Alphabet, claimed 78,101 total employees as of its Q3 earnings.

 Amazon is planning a push into digital advertising in 2018   
 11:19  AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  00:50 
 Amazon has been quietly experimenting with various advertising products across its portfolio and off its website, according to interviews with half a dozen ad buyers and technology partners. And it's getting ready to make waves in 2018.
 Most of the conversations are focusing on new ad opportunities on Amazon's e-commerce search and video products, sources say. 
The company is also looking to sell advertising beyond Amazon sites and products. For example, a source with knowledge about the situation says it is working with third-party mobile advertising companies such as Kargo to pair advertising on television and on mobile screens.

 Echo Dot and price wars help catapult Amazon as this year's leader in retail   
 12:56  PM ET Tue, 26 Dec 2017 |  04:34 
 Ad industry sources also say Amazon is stepping up hiring for its advertising division, especially in the New York area. CFO Brian Olsavsky noted that the company was hiring more ad sales staff on its  Q2 earnings call in July.
Amazon did not respond to requests for comment on its advertising business.
 Why Amazon wants in
 Digital advertising was a $209 billion business globally in 2017, according to media buying research firm Magna Global. And it's only increasing: The company predicts the industry will grow 13 percent to $237 billion next year. The U.S. is currently the most lucrative market, where advertisers spent $40.1 billion on digital advertising during the first half of 2017 alone, according to digital ad industry group Interactive Advertising Bureau.
Although Amazon doesn't break out revenues from its advertising business, eMarketer estimates Amazon was the fifth-largest digital advertiser in the U.S. in terms of revenue this year. Still, it makes up a little more than 2 percent of the market. It's leagues below industry leaders Google and Facebook, which take home more than 70 percent combined, according to a recent estimate from analysts at Pivotal.
But advertisers have been searching for a third large competitor in order to lower prices and force Google and Facebook to be more open about sharing user data. Amazon could be a major player, if only based on the sheer volume of consumer insights it has thanks to its robust e-commerce business. 
Two media buyers said Amazon showed some willingness to share more user data than Google and Facebook have traditionally — if the advertising budget was big enough. 
As a result, advertisers are welcoming Amazon with open arms, with one media buyer saying some of its consumer packaged goods clients already spend more on Amazon search ads than Google.
Another media buyer said that while Google is still the search ad category leader, Amazon is gaining ground and budgets are quickly shifting in its direction.
""Driving conversion and sales or creating very immersive high-impact branded content is what drives a lot of digital advertising revenue,"" said Aaron Shapiro, CEO of advertising agency Huge. ""Amazon is a player in both those areas.""
 Amazon's expansion plans
 Amazon already allows companies to sponsor product listings so they will show up at the top of relevant search results in its store. It wants to expand, offering advertisers better data and algorithms to ensure its items get in front of the ideal customer. It's also selling custom pages with built-in video and stories to help advertisers' products stand out from the rest, such as this Acura ad.
 Companies can pay for sponsored listings, which ensure their products show up on the top of relevant search results.
 ""Amazon likes to talk about how 56 percent of product searches are coming through Amazon,"" said Diana Gordon, senior partner at media agency Mindshare. ""It's definitely a stat that causes advertisers to stand up."" 
If you remove the buy box on Amazon's site, it would rank in the top five of daily trafficked sites online, Gordon explained. Amazon can not only drive sales, it's becoming a place for people to read reviews.
""We know that consumers are using Amazon not only as retail, but also using it as product discovery and research,"" Gordon said. ""It could lead to making more purchases in brick-and-mortar stores."" 
Amazon also wants to expand video advertising business. In addition to allowing commercials on livestreamed content like it did on its Thursday Night Football streams this year, it's pitching companies on bespoke sponsored content. The branded videos would be created by established media publishers or by Amazon's own internal production team. Some ideas that are being floated around are creating infomercial-style videos for products with celebrity spokespeople.
""We have been having conversations of how do you take advantage of the video offering on Prime through digital advertising,"" said Sargi Mann, digital executive vice president at Havas Media Group. ""Instead of having superfluous ads, how can a brand have a part of that dialogue that is not advertising in its traditional form? I am always open and like to discuss new and innovative ways in media where ads can be more of an organic insertion."" 
In addition, the company has aspirations to expand advertising opportunities past owned-and-operated products. In December 2016, it launched cloud-based ad technology Transparent Ad Marketplace as a way for companies to buy display advertising on sites across the web. Header bidding services such as Transparent Ad Marketplace allow media buyers to bid on available advertising inventory before Google's DoubleClick can. Amazon wants to do more in the programmatic ad tech space, according to sources. 
The company is also looking to mobile ad technology partners to find ways to advertise across multiple devices. For example, it is in talks to work with Kargo to pair commercials with mobile ads, sources say. Theoretically, a sponsored product sold on Amazon would run during a TV show and then seconds later a viewer would be able to see a related ad on their mobile phone.
But Amazon has some disadvantages as it looks to take on pure-play advertisers Google and Facebook. In particular, working with Amazon causes conflict for some companies, since it is disrupting the way they traditionally sold products, forcing them to change strategies. 
""The reality is Amazon makes a lot of brands and companies nervous, and presence on Amazon is a necessary evil,"" said Thomas Choi, RPA chief product officer of media. ""For others in categories like automotive, it's going to replace the existing sales and purchase process. It's a little bit of a mixed bag about how brands perceive them.""

Google CEO Sundar Pichai
 It's been a pretty successful year for Alphabet, parent company of Google. 
 The stock is up more than 34 percent this year, and its market cap has swelled to more than $736 billion, according to data from FactSet. Its biggest cash cow is still Google's ads business, by a long shot.
But as Google's business grew, so did the number of companies expressing fear of Google.
 The financial search engine AlphaSense tracks which companies see Google as a threat by scouring the year's earnings, event transcripts, releases and major SEC filings for mentions of the search giant that appear within 15 words of synonyms for competition, risk, threat and similar words. It registered 262 hits this year, up from 236 last year. 
So, which companies talked fretfully — or fielded anxious queries from investors and analysts — about Google this year? 
Foremost was the advertising agency WPP, which had nine anxiety-fueled Google references in 2017, up from seven in 2016. 
Prominently, one of those came during the company's third-quarter earnings when its own presentation asked the question: ""Are Google and Facebook eating our lunch?""
WPP saw pretty flat revenue in Q3 and North American revenue growth declined, though CEO Martin Sorrell has said that low growth is the ""new normal"" and that Google and Facebook aren't actually disrupting the traditional ad agency model. (The fear here is that even though Google and Facebook get the bulk of WPP's ad spend, they also encourage its clients to use their tools directly versus going through an agency middleman.)
Criteo, a French ad-tech company, also saw an increase from 4 to 5 Google-related references this year. One question came during a Stifel Technology Conference in June, where an analyst asked about how the company differentiates its products from Google's.
Although the two companies have a significant partnership, they also have a competing product. However, Criteo CFO Benoit Fouilland said Google tends to go after the ""long-tail"" versus the top markets that his company chases. 
""[T]here are certain obstacles as well for Google to be able to develop the type of close relationship we've developed with large retailers,"" answered Fouilland. ""Many of them would be very reluctant to share the type of data they share with us with Google. So that's probably one of the reasons why we don't face Google that much even if they have definitely a competing product.""
On the travel-related side of things, Expedia had six Google mentions, according to AlphaSense. 
In July, Dara Khosrowshahi (then Expedia CEO, now running Uber) called Google an ""existential threat"" to Expedia that was competing for ""the consumers' hearts and minds when they have a travel question"" in  an interview with The Financial Times.
As Google has fleshed out its flight and hotel comparison tools, Trivago is feeling the heat, too.
 ""Google is, from our perspective, the key competitor,"" Axel Hefer, CFO of Trivago, said in response to a question at a Morgan Stanley conference. As Google mimics Trivago's offerings, the company has to keep launching new products and ""[can]not stand still because everything that you do can be copied, obviously, in a certain time period.""
Here's the full list of companies expressing fear of Google, according to AlphaSense. 
 WPP, 9 references Expedia, 6 references Criteo, 5 references Trivago, 5 references Yandex, 4 references PayPal, 4 references Nielsen, 3 references Box, 3 references Cisco, 3 references Twenty-first Century Fox, 3 references Lending Tree, 3 references

105,2017-12-27,Google is a vital source of revenue for some Japanese game makers -- here's why  What's next for Google's Eric Schmidt? Sree Sreenivasan weighs in  ,"Getty Images
Google CEO Sundar Pichai
 When Casey, a security officer in his early 30s from San Jose, California, first started playing the Japanese mobile game Puzzles & Dragons, he was obsessed.
 ""I would play constantly, everyday,"" he says. ""Even on my breaks at work, I would play non-stop.""
During his first month, he estimates that he spent about $600 in the game, mainly to obtain special characters (many Japanese games use  a ""Gacha"" mechanism where users can spin to win prizes). He says he has friends who he knows have spent thousands of dollars on Puzzles & Dragons.
 Although Casey lives in California, not Japan, his playing habits resembled those of a typical Japanese gamer: super high engagement and a willingness to shell out real money.
Japan is the top market for mobile game revenue and its spoils have surpassed mobile gaming revenue in the United States for the third year in a row, according to data from App Annie, despite the fact that the U.S. has three times as many smartphone users. Japan ranks highest in terms of average number of sessions in games per app user, and Japanese mobile app users use gaming apps twice as frequently as users in the US.
 A balanced split between iOS and Android
 Of the 12 public companies that have disclosed that they are generating 25% or more of their revenue through Google parent company Alphabet, the seven most reliant are all Japanese app developers, according to data from FactSet. These companies make money through the Google Play Store.

 FactSet and company filings 
 Gungho, the company that created Puzzles & Dragons, makes 35.7% of its revenue from Google Play and 54.1% from Apple's App Store, according to FactSet.
The company most reliant on Google Play, Ignis, sourced 48% of its revenue through Play and 38.1% of its revenue through the App Store.
That highlights what's particularly interesting about Japan: The Japanese mobile game market leans more heavily toward Google's Android platform than other markets.
Consider Zynga, the American app company with the highest disclosed percentage of its revenue coming from Alphabet: The breakdown is 29% Google Play Store, 46% Apple App Store. That's in line with the conventional wisdom that iPhone users are generally wealthier than Android users and tend to spend significantly more on apps overall.
But Japan's mobile gaming market bucks that trend. In many other parts of the world, Android phone owners will use a forked version of the Android operating system that has a different app store. But the Google Play Store has a wide download base in Japan, according to Lexi Sydow, market insights manager at App Annie.
 Currently, both Google and Apple take a 30 percent cut of in-app purchases, and Google  will start taking a 15 percent cut of subscriptions in 2018, mirroring Apple's 2016 switch.
But as much as that upcoming charge reduction is a boon for developers, it highlights a risk: As quickly as Apple or Google can positively affect developers, they can just as easily change pricing or impose new rules.
Think of the downturn Zynga suffered when Facebook made some tweaks in 2012.
Sourcing so much of their revenue from two app stores means that these gaming companies are uniquely vulnerable. Because, although these Japanese gaming companies are heavily reliant on Google, the relationship certainly doesn't swing both ways.
Alphabet doesn't specifically break out what percentage of its revenue comes from the Play Store — it lumps those revenues together with money from its swelling Cloud business and hardware sales. In Q3 of 2017, Alphabet's so-called ""Other Google revenues"" hit $3.4 billion. That's only 12% of its total revenue. If you tried to slice up how much of that comes from the Play Store, and in particular from Japan, the number wouldn't be consequential.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a company event in New York in May 2017.
 Microsoft on Wednesday announced that it has acquired Avere Systems, a start-up specializing in data storage. The technology could ultimately help Microsoft pick up more Azure revenue by serving customers who want to use cloud computing while still keeping data in their own facilities. 
 Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
Avere offers hardware for storing data in data centers, but the acquisition seems more about strengthening and increasing the use of Microsoft's Azure public cloud. The technology lets companies use remote computing resources while keeping their data in place, and it can ease the migration of data to public clouds as well.
 Avere offers tools for working with Microsoft's top two cloud competitors, Amazon Web Services and the Google Cloud Platform. Avere said it would bring its tools to Azure in 2015, but today the company's website primarily advertises its integrations with the Amazon and Google clouds.
""We are excited to welcome Avere to Microsoft, and look forward to the impact their technology and the team will have on Azure and the customer experience,"" Jason Zander, corporate vice president of Azure at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post. 
Overall, Microsoft has taken more of a hybrid approach than Amazon or Google in the cloud business. It offers the Azure Stack private cloud software that mirrors what's available from the Azure public cloud. And Microsoft continues to sell server and database software for corporate data centers.
""Over the years, Microsoft has made significant investments to provide its customers with the most flexible, secure and scalable storage solutions in the marketplace and has made Azure the natural home for enterprise applications. This shared focus on large enterprise applications makes Microsoft a great fit for Avere,"" Avere CEO Ron Bianchini, a former vice president of storage hardware company NetApp, wrote in a blog post.
Google, the main business unit of Alphabet, made a rare direct investment in Avere last year. (Most Alphabet investments come through its venture arms.) Other investors include Western Digital Capital, Menlo Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Tenaya Capital. In total Avere raised $97 million.
Avere was founded in 2008 and is based in Pittsburgh. Its customers include Johns Hopkins University, Sony Pictures' Imageworks and the Library of Congress.

 Roku is getting in on the smart voice assistant market.
 Roku said Wednesday that it will launch a voice assistant that will allow users of existing Roku players and TVs to control the devices by voice.
The company said its third-party partners will build new speakers and other audio systems that can link right into the Roku Connect ecosystem. It will enable Roku owners to speak simple commands, such as ""play classical music in the kitchen,"" for example. TCL, one partner, will unveil its first Roku voice assistant product during the CES gadget show in Las Vegas next week, Roku said.
 Roku didn't provide any additional examples as to what users might be able to do with voice controls. Google Home and Amazon Echo products allow users to play music, control their TVs, check the weather, ask trivia questions and more.
Amazon and Google also offer streaming sticks, the Chromecast and the Fire TV Stick, respectively, which compete directly with some of Roku's products. Voice controls may help it play a bit of catch-up in the space.
A software update that includes the new features is set to arrive this fall, Roku said.

Satya Nadella speaking at the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 Microsoft, Amazon, and Google said they are working on updates to cloud services and other products to prevent exploitation of chip-level security vulnerabilities.
 The vulnerabilities, which were publicly disclosed by the Register on Tuesday, could allow a hacker to steal information stored in the memory of a wide range of computer chips running on personal devices, like computers, as well as servers in data centers, including those used to run cloud computing services. It could allow a hacker to steal information stored in the memory of the chip itself, including things such as passwords and cached files. It could also pave the way for attackers to weaken other security features.
One of the vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown, is known to affect Intel chips. Another, Spectre, could affect chips from many vendors. Indeed, Arm said that some processors based on its technology are affected.
 ""We're aware of this industry-wide issue and have been working closely with chip manufacturers to develop and test mitigations to protect our customers,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. ""We are in the process of deploying mitigations to cloud services and have also released security updates to protect Windows customers against vulnerabilities affecting supported hardware chips from Intel, Arm, and AMD.""
In addition to patching its cloud services and current and older versions of Windows for servers and desktops, Microsoft has updated its Edge and Internet Explorer browsers. Updates for Microsoft Surface devices are coming as well.
Google was the company to first alert Intel to the vulnerability, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on CNBC earlier on Wednesday.
Subsequently Google released some details about the issues but said a full report is still to come. A new site discussing the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities credits Google's Jann Horn and third-party researchers with discovering them.
Google said it has updated its public cloud service to prevent attacks related to Meltdown and Spectre. ""We used our VM Live Migration technology to perform the updates with no user impact, no forced maintenance windows and no required restarts,"" Google engineering vice president Ben Treynor Sloss wrote in a blog post. But customers will still need to update the operating systems they use on the Google cloud.
Google has also been busy checking on consumer services. Exploitation is ""difficult and limited"" for most Android devices, and the latest version of Chrome OS is patched, Google said.
Amazon told customers of its Amazon Web Services cloud service that the vulnerability ""has existed for more than 20 years in modern processor architectures like Intel, AMD, and ARM across servers, desktops, and mobile devices."" It said that it's already protected nearly all AWS instances, although customers will still have to patch the operating systems they use. 
In the CNBC interview Krzanich said he was not aware of exploits of the issue, and Microsoft has not gotten any indication that the vulnerabilities ""had been used to attack our customers,"" the spokesperson said.
Aside from security concerns, the Register and some individuals suggested that patches to operating systems could result in performance slowdowns. But in a statement on Wednesday, Intel said that ""any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.""
Microsoft told customers of its Azure public cloud in a blog post that they ""should not see a noticeable performance impact.""
VMware has come out with patches for its desktop and server virtualization software.
Linux distribution vendor Red Hat is working on making product updates available to customers. ""Red Hat is taking a proactive position that favors security over performance, while allowing users the flexibility to assess their own environment and make appropriate tradeoffs through selectively enabling and disabling the various mitigations,"" the company said on a website devoted to the vulnerabilities.
Some Red Hat patches are live, and more will be coming in the next few days, a spokesperson told CNBC in an email.

 With the cryptocurrency ripple hitting new highs, its founder is now one of America's richest people   
 4:28  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018 |  00:50 
 Thanks to one digital currency's surge in the last few weeks, the co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple is now one of the five richest people in America. 
 Chris Larsen, co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple, has 5.19 billion of the company's digital coin XRP and a 17 percent stake in the company, according to Forbes, citing sources at Ripple. 
With XRP hitting a high of $3.84 on Thursday, Larsen's holdings are worth about $59.9 billion. That puts the former Ripple CEO just ahead of Larry Ellison, who ranked fifth on Forbes 400 list with a worth of $58.4 billion. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg ranks fourth, with a worth of $74.4 billion. 
 Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin rank eighth and 10th on the list, respectively. 
A representative for Ripple said the company had nothing to add.
Its XRP coin soared 35,500 percent to $2.30 last year, far outpacing bitcoin's and ethereum's gains. The company owns 61.3 billion of the 100 billion XRP coins in existence, giving Ripple a market value of nearly $235.4 billion Thursday.
The San Francisco-based start-up is using blockchain technology to develop a payments network that more than 100 financial institutions are using, according to the company. Ripple's website also says that the XRP coin has a four-second settlement time, versus more than two minutes for ethereum and over an hour for bitcoin.
Cryptocurrency founders can often hold large amounts of the digital coins they create. The anonymous bitcoin founder known as ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" has 980,000 bitcoins, or about 4.7 percent of all bitcoins that will ever exist, based on widely accepted analysis by Sergio Demian Lerner. 
With bitcoin near $15,000 Thursday, Nakamoto's share is worth just $14.7 billion.

Tim Cook, chief executive officer of Apple Inc., waves after speaking during an event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Sept. 12, 2017.
 Apple is acquiring Vancouver-based Buddybuild for an undisclosed sum, the start-up announced on Tuesday. Buddybuild makes tools that help programmers avoid and fix bugs in their software, and to generally keep each other apprised about changes made to code they're working on together. Prior to the acquisition, Buddybuild had raised $8.8 million in venture funding from investors including Amplify Partners, Bloomberg Beta, First Round Capital, Kleiner Perkins and others. Buddybuild's founders, Dennis Pilarinos and Christopher Stott, previously worked for Amazon. 
Google is investing $120 million into Chushou, a Chinese competitor to Amazon-owned Twitch. Chushou's mobile TV platform allows gamers to livestream mobile games as they play to compete before spectators. Mobile games like Honor of Kings by Tencent and Onmyoji by Netase are wildly popular in China, a nation with more than 500 million mobile gamers, according to estimates from Research and Markets. Other investors in Chushou: GGV Capital, Shunwei Capital, Qiming Venture Partners, and Feidian Capital.
 Start-ups
 Wealthfront, a ""robo-advisor"" for financial advice, raised $75 million in a new round of venture funding led by Tiger Global Management and joined by the company's earlier backers: Benchmark Capital, Greylock Partners, Index Ventures, Ribbit Capital, Social Capital and Spark Capital Growth. Wealthfront CEO Andy Rachleff was a co-founder of Benchmark Capital. With lower fees than traditional wealth management firms, robo-advisors like Wealthfront, Betterment and Wealthsimple are thriving. Juniper Research predicts that automated wealth management will generate some $25 billion in revenue annually by 2022, up from $1.7 billion in 2017.
 Aimotive is developing self-driving vehicle technology using off-the-shelf cameras, rather than lidar sensors.
 Cisco Investments, Samsung Catalyst Fund and Robert Bosch Venture Capital are among investors in Aimotive, a Budapest-based start-up developing self-driving car systems. The company announced Thursday it raised a $38 million series C round of venture funding led by B Capital Group and Prime Ventures. Like Tesla, Aimotive believes that radar and lidar sensors are not necessary to make cars safely autonomous. Instead, the start-up says it's using ""off-the-shelf camera sensors and artificial intelligence-based vision processing."" The company said it is testing vehicle fleets in Hungary, France and the U.S., and working with automotive manufacturers including Groupe PSA, SAIC, and Volvo. 
Despite the failures of several start-ups making smart kitchen appliances — like Juicero, Teaforia and The Orange Chef — investors are still placing bets on companies in food tech. The latest to attract a venture round, Drop Kitchen, makes an internet-connect kitchen scale that works in conjunction with its recipe app. According to an SEC filing, Dublin-based Drop Kitchen raised $7.3 million from Alsop Louie Partners. Additional investors in Drop Kitchen include Frontline Ventures, WI Harper, Sinovation Ventures, PCH, and Irish star chef Ross Lewis. Founded in 2011, the company in more recent years has billed itself as a developer of an operating system for smart kitchen devices made by top manufacturers. 
 Five predictions for digital currencies in 2018 — including stomach-churning drops, bitcoin-related IPO
 Coinify raised a $4.8 million bridge round from Nordic Eye for blockchain payment technology. Founded in 2014 in Copenhagen, Coinify makes it easy for retailers and other consumer-facing companies to accept payments in bitcoin or more than a dozen other cryptocurrencies. The start-up also operates a ""coin-agnostic"" trading platform, says CEO Mark Hojgaard.
Nordic Eye's general partner told CNBC his firm backed Coinify because it's a smart, enterprise tech company that is not tied to the success or regulatory approval of any digital currency. ""We aren't putting our money into the currencies themselves. But there is tremendous potential for the blockchain to enable unbanked people, living in nations without a stable government or currency, to send and receive money safely.""

The Echo Plus looks great around the house
 People do actually want to use their smart speakers to shop. 
 Newly published research from Google and Peerless found that 62 percent of smart speaker owners surveyed said they were likely to buy something through their speaker in the next month. 
That's good news for both Google and Amazon — which so steeply discounted their smart speaker products over the holidays that they each likely lost a few dollars on every unit sold. The solution to that could come through sponsored shopping.  
 As CNBC reported earlier this week, Amazon has big plans for bringing sponsored products ads to Alexa in 2018, allowing brands to promote their products in shopping searches or recommend them if a user asks their Echo a related question, like the best way to clean up a spill. Google, which currently allows Home users to buy products through its shopping service, Express, obviously has a lot of experience with paid product searches, too. 
The survey, which was conducted this fall among 1,642 U.S. monthly active voice-activated speaker owners, also asked what kinds of information people would be willing to get from companies. It found that 52 percent of people wanted information about deals, sales and promotions, 48 percent would like personalized tips, 42 percent would be open to getting info about upcoming events and activities, 39 percent would like store locations and hours, and 38 percent wanted access to customer service.
As more people start shopping through the Google and Amazon speakers now blinking in their kitchens, living rooms or bedrooms, both companies will be trying to figure out the best way to monetize their new voice-activated format. 
Meanwhile, some users see their Echo or Home as more than just a piece of hardware: 41 percent of people said that communicating with their speaker feels like talking to a friend or another person. 
Also included in the survey, here are the top reasons people said that they use their smart speakers:
 It allows me to more easily multitask. It enables me to do things faster than other devices. It empowers me to instantly get answers and information. It makes my daily routine easier.

Google Home
 Google just announced that it has sold ""tens of millions"" of its home devices over the last year, including its smart speakers and Chromecast TV streaming devices  — and more than one Home speaker every second since the Home Mini started shipping in October.
 Some quick math: That means that Google has sold at least 6.7 million devices since Oct. 19. 
That's a refreshingly concrete number, if not uniquely huge. Amazon said that it sold ""tens of millions"" of Alexa-enabled devices and that its Echo Dot sold ""millions"" of units over the holidays. Amazon's Echo products are widely seen as dominating the smart speaker market: CIRP estimated last fall that Amazon's Echo products had a 76 percent market share in the U.S. compared with 24 percent for Google's Home devices. 
 Both companies offered steep discounts on their products over the holidays, likely losing money on every sale. 
Google also said that Assistant, the artificial intelligence that users can engage with via voice or text, is now available on more than 400 million devices, including phones, headphones, TVs and watches. It can also control more than 1,500 smart home devices such as smart lightbulbs or plugs. 
 Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the Google product that sold in the ""tens of millions"" last year.

 });The Vuzix Blade smart glasses will be the first powered by Amazon's Alexa, as unveiled at CES 2018 in Las Vegas.
 Vuzix will unveil a set of smart glasses powered by Alexa next week, as Amazon's smart assistant continues to pose a threat to leading platforms from Apple and Google. 
 Shares of Vuzix popped 18.6 percent Friday afternoon on the news. 
The $1,000 glasses are aimed at a ""prosumer"" market, such as golfers or business customers, the company said, but will eventually come down in price and incorporate new features.
 Voice assistants are key on smaller devices, such as glasses, where swiping is impractical. And Amazon has found a way to tap that market though small companies like Vuzix, which has a market capitalization of just about $186 million.
Vuzix's is one of many augmented-reality products expected out of CES, a consumer electronics trade show taking place in Las Vegas next week.
Augmented reality is a technology that projects computerized images onto a live video image from the real world, while its cousin virtual reality completely embeds the user in a 360-degree computer-generated world.
Depending on their quality, availability and price, these AR products could haunt Apple, which has planned its own smart speaker and is reportedly working on augmented reality glasses. But with Siri's HomePod debut delayed, Alexa seems to be stepping into the augmented reality market.
 Why Vuzix believes the time is ripe for AR glasses
 Vuzix has a long-standing presence as a wearables maker in the enterprise technology market, working with companies such as DHL, Airbus and Bosch. But CEO Paul Travers said he's bullish enough on the impact of new augmented reality technologies that he plans to take Vuzix glasses to consumer markets early in the second quarter of this year. 
""Our opinion is that if you make something that solves a problem, there's a market for it,"" he said.
He said that from the early 2000s, clients had requested ""Oakley-style"" smart glasses, but until recently, it was difficult to package fast processing power into a small hardware package like glasses frames. But coming technologies, particularly 5G internet connectivity and faster processors, will allow more communication between the ""edge"" of the device and the cloud, enabling advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence to appear on small, thin screens. 
Travers said that Microsoft, Google and Apple are still the only widespread platforms for developers to make augmented reality products. But, he said, limiting them to phone apps much longer, as Apple has so far done, could limit their appeal.  
""How many people are going to hold the phone up? It's unnatural,"" he said. 
Still, Travers said, his views on augmented reality are aligned with those of Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has said that augmented reality, rather than virtual reality, will prevail as a future computing platform. He said that many experimental uses of VR, such as Magic Leap, seem more like ""science projects"" and that his company is prioritizing real-world applications over animating creatures to jump around the field of view. 
He compared virtual reality to a PDA — a self-contained device — while augmented reality was connected to the world, like an iPhone.
""I believe what Apple does — AR changes everything,"" he said. ""VR is head-in-a-bucket stuff ... Most people are sweating after an hour. It's got issues. Technical hurdles. But with a conventional pair of glasses — just regular glasses — information comes up and just stays up in front of you. ... AR allows you to be in the real world, and there's so much more you can do.""

Whirlpool's Scan-to-Cook technology
 Whirlpool has said Apple Watch wearers will soon be able to remotely control their home appliances.
 It would mean smart watch owners could change temperature settings on ovens, delay cycles on washers or check how long is left to run on a dryer.
The manufacturer announced the development at the CES tech show in Las Vegas Monday and said it's the first time that an appliance maker has connected its products with the Apple Watch.
 Compatibility with Apple Watch will begin with a roll out to more than 20 of Whirlpool's connected appliances this year.
The new technology heralds another stage in the rapid development of connected white-ware. Last week Amazon announced that you would soon be able to control your microwave oven from its smart assistant, Alexa.
Whirlpool said Monday that will be a reality this year, stating that families will be able to control its 2018 range of appliances with voice commands to both Amazon's Alexa and Google's home assistant.

 In a separate press release, also published Monday, Whirlpool said consumers will also soon be able to connect smart appliances to Honeywell's line of thermostats.
Those capabilities will allow consumers to set their appliance to ""away mode"" when their phone or Apple Watch detects that the homeowner has gone out.
One example would be setting a dishwasher to only start its washing cycle once a person was a certain distance away from the property and outside a ""geo-fence"". The company added that managing the temperature of the home could also be set to sync with appliance cycles.
Brett Dibkey, Whirlpool Corporation vice president of brand strategy in North America, said the new technology would ""take the guesswork out"" of domestic energy management.
Whirlpool Corporation claims to be the leading appliance manufacturer in the world, with approximately $21 billion in annual sales.

 });James Damore, the Google engineer who was fired after his internal memo criticizing the company's diversity efforts went viral, has filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against the company. 
 Damore's original memo, which leaked last fall, criticized Google's culture as ""left leaning"" and argued that women in engineering were paid less than men because of their biological differences, not because of hiring practices, among other topics. It sparked a discussion about rampant sexism in Silicon Valley, and Google said that portions of the memo were contrary to the company's ""basic values"" and Code of Conduct. 
The lawsuit, which was filed in the Santa Clara Superior Court on Monday, alleges that Google ""discriminated against employees for their perceived conservative political views,"" as well as due to their ""male gender"" and ""Caucasian race"" and then ""systematically punished"" them.
 David Gudeman — another former Google employee, who was fired in December 2016 — is also listed as a plaintiff. The suit alleges that he was fired for his comments on a coworker's thread about being targeted by the FBI for his religion. 
The lawsuit seeks to represent all Google employees who have been discriminated against for being male, Caucasian or conservative and seeks monetary, non-monetary and punitive damages. 
""Google employees who expressed views deviating from the majority view at Google on political subjects raised in the workplace and relevant to Google's employment policies and its business, such as 'diversity' hiring policies, 'bias sensitivity,' or 'social justice' were/are singled out, mistreated, and systematically punished and terminated from Google, in violation of their legal rights,"" the lawsuit states.
The suit also alleges that Google has ""open hostility for conservative thought,"" that Damore and others were ""ostracized, belittled and punished"" for their views, that the company is an ""ideological echo chamber"" that uses ""illegal hiring quotas"" at the expense of white males. 
The lawsuit comes after Damore has spent the several months since his firing talking to press about discrimination and how Google ""betrayed"" him, including one conversation where he compared being a conservative at Google to ""being gay in the 1950s."" 
During a press conference, Harmeet K. Dhillon, the lawyer representing the case, said Google isn't the only company guilty of this kind of prejudice and that she hopes the lawsuit will act as a wake-up call for Silicon Valley, where the ""only acceptable form of discrimination"" is against ""conservatives and white men.""
A Google spokesperson said the company ""looks forward to defending against Mr. Damore's lawsuit in court.""
Meanwhile, Google is also facing a class-action lawsuit for gender pay discrimination.

Google has a giant display advertising its hardware products at the 2018 CES show.
 Google typically keeps a low profile at CES. Not this year.
 As techies swarm Las Vegas for the annual Consumer Electronics Show, the world's biggest internet company is squarely out to capture their attention. It's created a giant ""playground"" in the parking lot of one of the convention centers, complete with a slide and a faux gumball machine.
The words ""Hey Google"" — used by consumers to ask questions of the voice-powered Google Assistant — are plastered on multiple casinos as well as the monorail that whisks attendees between conferences halls.
 CNBC
A gigantic gumball machine as part of Google's display at the 2018 CES.
 Google isn't explicitly saying it, but the company is spending all this promotional money in an aggressive push to take on a single rival: Amazon.
On Monday, Google announced a slew of new products and updates for Assistant, its artificial intelligence software that lives on a range of devices like Home smart speakers.
Google debuted partnerships with JBL, Lenovo, LG, and Sony to launch new, Assistant-powered ""smart displays"" equipped with front-facing cameras that will let users watch media and make video calls, similar to Amazon's Echo Show.
Since Amazon launched the $230 Show last spring, both Google and Facebook have reportedly been working on their own versions. It now appears that Google will be leaving the hardware production to partners, at least at first.
Google also announced that it will start referring to Assistant's capabilities as ""Actions,"" akin to how Amazon has ""Skills"" for Alexa.
They're not perfectly analogous. Google's Actions include asking your Assistant for directions using Maps, as well as features enabled through third parties, while Amazon's Skills only refer to Alexa voice apps built by third-party developers.
 Amazon recently said that Alexa has over 30,000 Skills while Google just announced that Assistant can perform more than 1 million ""Actions."" Users can search for Actions via a newly launched directory page.
If you've been following the news blasting out of CES at all, then you've probably noticed the trend -- companies are building smart assistants into everything, including  ovens and  refrigerators, countless new headphones and speakers, and cars.
Google said on Monday that new partners will be launching Assistant-optimized headphones this year and that Assistant is coming to the more than 400 car models that already run its Android Auto operating system. Meanwhile, Panasonic announced this morning that, alongside Assistant, it was launching Alexa Onboard, which lets users interact with Alexa in their cars, even when there is no network connection.

 Facebook is reportedly entering the hardware business with a home device for video calling, according to a report from finance outlet Cheddar.
 The Portal home device would act primarily as a video phone, in line with Facebook's long-time mission of connecting friends and relatives, but would also allow access to streaming services like Spotify and Netflix, Cheddar reported.
The Portal device is rumored to cost $499 — significantly more than comparable devices like the Amazon Echo Show, which sells for $230 — and will start shipping in the second half of 2018, according to Cheddar.
 It marks another entrant into the increasingly crowded voice-activated space and will have some stiff competition in Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices, the Google Home, and Apple's HomePod.

Pokemon Go players are seen in search of Pokemon and other in game items in Pasadena Playhouse District
 Google Fiber, once one of the internet company's most audacious projects, just lost another executive as the business struggles to gain traction. 
 Gabriel Stricker, who joined Fiber from Twitter in late 2015, was serving as vice president of communications and policy. CNBC has learned that he left to become vice president of communications at Niantic, the gaming company that created the viral Pokemon Go app.
Stricker tweeted about his new gig on Tuesday:
 Tweet
 It's been a tough couple of years for Fiber. As part of Access, the Alphabet unit, Fiber has endured cost-cutting measures, layoffs, and two CEO resignations. It once planned to blanket the country with super-fast gigabit internet access using fiber but has pivoted to focus on cheaper wireless alternatives or leasing existing fiber. 
In February 2017, Access shifted hundreds of employees away from Fiber and hired a new CEO, Gregory McCray, from Aero Communications. He resigned in less than six months, and the Access group is still hunting for a new leader. 
 Source: Google
 A Google spokesperson confirmed Stricker's departure and said the company has no plans to hire a new communications VP. This was Stricker's second stint in public relations at Google. 
Niantic was an early pioneer in augmented reality with Pokemon Go, and the company is now developing technology for the growing number of AR platforms. CEO John Hanke said late last year that it's launching a Harry Potter game in 2018 as a joint venture with Warner Bros.
Niantic Labs was part of Google until 2015. As part of the restructuring into Alphabet, it was spun out into an independent company.

111,2018-01-10,"Top Google recruiter: Google uses this 'shocking' strategy to hire the best employees  Ex-Apple exec: Thanks to Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, we're addicted to tech — and ‘they are the only ones’ who can fix it  ","When it comes to hiring, most companies use this standard formula: You speak with an HR representative, you interview with your potential boss, you may meet with other senior level employees within the company and then one person makes the final hiring decision.
 Google takes a different approach that may ""shock"" some, according to a Google Partners podcast. The company's global staffing lead and senior recruiter Lisa Stern Haynes says that the tech giant is able to employ the very best because a group of people have to agree on each person that's hired.
A hiring manager can say no to an applicant for any reason, says Haynes. On the flip side, a hiring manager cannot single-handedly give the ""final yes"" to extend a job offer. All suitable candidates must be passed along to a hiring committee for review.
 ""When managers come to Google for the first time and hear this, especially after years and years of having it a very different way at their previous companies, they're shocked,"" says Haynes.
But the tech giant stands by its strategy of making hiring decisions through a team consensus. ""Research tells us that teams that have diverging opinions can make better less biased decisions. And that also applies to the way we make hiring decisions too,"" Haynes explains.

 });
 The senior recruiter admits that utilizing a hiring committee does slow down the hiring process, although this approach is beneficial for the company in the long run. Haynes explains that you often see employers rushing to settle for a candidate because of time pressure, or even hiring someone due to a preexisting relationship or as a favor to someone.
This can lead to a bad hire, which has a really ""long lasting negative effect on a team or a company's culture,"" says Haynes. ""It's way better to take the time and go through a very robust hiring committee on the front end and then identify the best possible candidate the first time around.""
The hiring committees at Google are usually made up of leaders in the specific organization doing the hiring. Members serve on the committee for three to six months before being rotated out of the committee. However, the individual hiring manager is not part of the committee, which Haynes says new managers also find surprising.

 11:27  AM ET Thu, 21 Dec 2017 |  01:03 
 Here's how hiring decisions are made, she says: The hiring manager first interviews the candidate and then fills out a hiring packet that includes things like the detailed interview feedback, the recruiter's notes from the initial conversation, internal references if the person knows someone at Google and external references if the person has submitted professional references.
The hiring manager then passes this review on to the independent committees. The best part of this chain, says Haynes, is that unlike the hiring manager, committee members are removed from the urgency of selecting someone and are able to judge the applicant based solely on merit.
""They're like a layer of objectivity and they're looking to see does this person match the qualification for this immediate role at hand,"" says the lead recruiter. ""Also, are they gonna be a good fit for the organization as a whole for the longer term,""
This is particularly important for a company like Google in which employees jump from team to team and from role to role. In fact, Haynes says that the company values applicants who are problem-solvers and who have a ""general cognitive ability"" over role-related knowledge because positions are constantly shifting.
""If you think about how quickly Google changes, if you just hire someone to do one specific job but then our company needs change, we need to be rest assured that that person is going to find something else to do at Google,"" she says. ""That comes back to hiring smart generalists.""

 UK adults spend 8+ hrs on screens/day, children 6.5 hrs. Don't ignore the link betw social media use & depression. 34% of people checked Facebook in the last 10 minutes.
 Admitting you have an addiction is Step 1.
 We need to control our own environment & we need information:
 Apple Watches, Google Phones, Facebook, Twitter - they've gotten so good at getting us to go for another click, another dopamine hit. They now have a responsibility & need to start helping us track & manage our digital addictions across all usages - phone, laptop, TV etc.
 They're the only ones who can do this -
 They need to give access to that information to 3rd-party apps, so that we can manage & limit our time on them, control notifications, etc. There will a lot of great startups that will create useful tools to help us become balanced - digital & analog - again…
 With (or without) these tools, it's up to us to act:
 The comments from Fadell come as consumer addiction to technology is top of mind.
Two prominent investors in Apple — Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs — sent a letter to the Cupertino-based tech behemoth on Saturday pointing out the extent to which young people are addicted to their smartphones. (Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs own $2 billion worth of Apple stock.)
""More than 10 years after the iPhone's release, it is a cliché to point out the ubiquity of Apple's devices among children and teenagers, as well as the attendant growth in social media use by this group. What is less well known is that there is a growing body of evidence that, for at least some of the most frequent young users, this may be having unintentional negative consequences,"" the letter says.
Apple has responded to the letter. Since 2008, parental controls have been available for many Apple products, the company points out.
""Apple has always looked out for kids, and we work hard to create powerful products that inspire, entertain, and educate children while also helping parents protect them online. We lead the industry by offering intuitive parental controls built right into the operating system,"" Apple says in a statement shared with CNBC Make It.
""We think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them. We take this responsibility very seriously and we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids.""
Apple did not respond to the claim that adults are also addicted to their technology.
Twitter declined to comment. 
Facebook and Google had not responded to request for comment by the time this story was published.
Fadell pressed Apple to respond to the claim for adults, too.
Indeed, Adam Alter, an associate professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, wrote a book, ""Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked,"" making the case that in addition to kids, adults are addicted to technology.
""We're biologically prone to getting hooked on these sorts of experiences. If you put someone in front of a slot machine, their brain will look qualitatively the same as when they take heroin. If you're someone who compulsively plays video games — not everyone, but people who are addicted to a particular game — the minute you load up your computer, your brain will look like that of a substance abuser,"" Alter tells the New York Times. ""I find it interesting that the late Steve Jobs said in a 2010 interview that his own children didn't use iPads.""
Alter uses himself as an example: ""I'm addicted to email. I can't stop checking it. I can't go to bed at night if I haven't cleared my inbox. I'll keep my phone next to my bed, much as I try not to,"" says Alter.
""The technology is designed to hook us that way. Email is bottomless. Social media platforms are endless. Twitter? The feed never really ends. You could sit there 24 hours a day and you'll never get to the end. And so you come back for more and more,"" he tells the Times.
And according to Fadell's tweets, it's not hard to implement tools that would allow consumers to moderate their usage. He knows it, and so does Apple, he says.
 Thx to my friends @apple for your 1st response. It's not about only kids, adults need them for themselves too. U & I know it's technically EASY to build usage info & control tools. Looking fwd to many bold announcements @ WWDC in June on this imprtnt topic

Google CEO Sundar Pichai
 Google quietly acquired a U.K.-based company which turns the surface of devices such as smartphones into speakers with its technology. 
 A U.K. regulatory filing from December 2017 showed that Google subsidiary Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company, bought all the shares of NVF Tech, the parent company of Redux Laboratories. 
The filing did not list the price paid for the shares, but showed that all the stock held by investors and employees was transferred to Google in early September. 
 Redux's website is now dead. But a cached version of the site shows it was working on ""panel audio"" which removes the need for a speaker in a device. It also creates solutions to create so-called haptic feedback, which allows users to carry out different tasks on current smartphones by applying different pressure to the screen.
Crunchbase, a website which tracks acquisition and funding rounds, said that the acquisition happened in August. On Redux CEO Nedko Ivanov's LinkedIn page, it shows that he left the company in August 2017. It's unclear if he is now working for Google. On Ivanov's profile page, it says that Redux achieved a ""successful exit"" in August 2017, but it does not state the buyer. 
Redux's main investor was Arie Capital, a U.K.-based venture and private equity company, which invested $5 million. Arie has yet to respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC. Google has also not responded. 
CNBC could not get through to Prosper Capital, another former shareholder, via telephone. 
It's unclear why Google may have acquired this company, but the company has been pushing its hardware, particularly its Pixel 2 smartphone. It suggests this technology could be used in future hardware devices from Google. 
Redux has 178 granted patents with 50 pending, according to its LinkedIn page. It was founded in 2013.

 });Search engines had already existed when Larry Page and Sergey Brin decided to take a chance by thinking up and presenting the world with Google. 
 That risk paid off: 20 years later, the pair are worth more than $100 billion combined, according to the Forbes' 400 list, and Google is a household name.
If you had taken a chance and invested in Google in 2007, you might not have made billions, but still, your choice would have been a wise one — indeed, it's one even Berkshire Hathaway chairman and chief executive officer Warren Buffett says he regrets not making.
 That's because you could have roughly tripled your money: A $1,000 investment in Google, as represented by its parent company Alphabet in the below graphic, in 2007, would be worth $2,922 as of October 31.
The data comes from financial website How Much, which looked at popular stocks in 2007 to find out how much a $1,000 investment in each would be worth now.

 });
 Google's performance came in just shy of Nike's and Starbucks'.
In the graphic, the blue dots are equivalent to a $1,000 initial investment, and the pink dots equal the investment's current total value.
""The larger the pink circle, the more your investment is worth,"" according to How Much. ""If the pink fits inside the blue, then you lost money. The [graphic] assumes that you took any dividend paid out in cash and did not reinvest into the company by buying more stock.""
Keep in mind, though, that while Google's stock has performed well, any individual stock can over- or under-perform and past returns do not predict future results.
 These days, Google is coping withwidespread frustration about its parent company Alphabet's inability to identify and remove offensive content from YouTube, as well as claims from the Department of Labor that a gender pay gap exists among Google employees.
Still, investors are bullish on the company as it continues to expand its reach beyond Internet search and into phones, virtual assistants, and productivity and entertainment services.
As Rob Sanderson, an analyst at research firm MKM Partners recently wrote 
, Alphabet ""should provide investors with reliable gains into 2018 and beyond. … The company continues to deliver exceptional growth for a company its size.""
If you're interested in investing in Google, or just considering getting into the stock market, experts advise beginning carefully. Buffett and other experienced investors such as Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins suggest you start with index funds.
Index funds hold every stock in an index such as the S&P 500 and offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills. They also fluctuate with the market and eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.

 'Putting on the pressure' is the next step in combatting sexual harassment and equality: Tina Brown   
 11:06  AM ET Thu, 11 Jan 2018 |  04:35 
 Social media platforms and search engines like Facebook and Google have had an ""appalling"" influence on the media landscape, said former magazine editor Tina Brown.
 The media mogul spoke on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Thursday and said she is in favor of an ""industry-wide pressure"" for the companies to ""give back something"" and ""fund real journalism.""
""One of the great big scams of digital platforms is that they're able to kind of pretend that they care about the human good, while at the same time taking all the profits and all the revenue from people who are actually doing the work,"" said Brown, who is also the former editor of publications like Vanity Fair, The Daily Beast and The New Yorker.
 ""They use all that great work on their platforms and don't give anything back,"" she said. ""It's been a great scam. I'm glad they made out like bandits, but I think it's time they're viewed in the manner they should be.""

 Sites like Facebook and Google wreaked havoc on the media industry when they abruptly changed the business model by no longer requiring consumers to pay for content. Revenue made through advertising, once the main source of income for newspapers, quickly declined.
Across all media, the two companies account for as much as 73 percent of all digital advertising.
Last fall, Facebook wrote in a blog post that it is working with media outlets like The Washington Post, The Boston Globe and Economist to insert a paywall on Facebook and limit the number of free articles each month. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal already have similar models in place. 
""They have undermined the whole profession of journalism,"" Brown said on CNBC. Meanwhile, ""real journalist enterprises are struggling to get any advertising,"" she said.

 Steve Jobs may have predicted Google’s porn issue years ago   
 4:49  PM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  00:57 
 Google deleted 60 kid-themed apps from its Google Play app store after security firm Check Point found that they contained malware that could display pornographic content, trick users into installing fake ""security apps,"" or induce them to sign up for premium SMS services. 
 Using Google Play store estimates, Check Point found that the 60 games, with titles like ""Drawing Lessons Angry Birds,"" ""Temple Crash Jungle Bandicoot"" and ""Spinner Fidget Toy,"" had at least 3.5 million downloads and as many as 7 million (the range is so wide because of how Google provides its publicly available download estimates). Check Point dubbed the malware ""AdultSwine,"" and soon after the security firm alerted Google to the problem, the apps disappeared from the Play store.
 ""We have a good working relationship with Google's security team,"" Daniel Padon, a Check Point researcher, tells CNBC.
 However, even after Google deleted the apps from Play, the malware will continue to live on in people's phones until they get rid of it. 
""We've removed the apps from Play, disabled the developers' accounts, and will continue to show strong warnings to anyone that has installed them,"" a Google spokesperson says. ""We appreciate Check Point's work to help keep users safe.""
Once a person downloaded one of the infected apps, pop-ups would either alert them that they had a virus and direct them to a fake security app, convince them to enter their phone number through a contest to win an iPhone, or show them pornographic content. The latter is particularly disturbing considering that most of these infected apps were games or drawing tutorials intended to entice kids. 
Although the apps would likely be most appealing to kids, Google says that they wouldn't have appeared in what Play calls its Designed for Families section, where it recommends safe, appropriate ads for children. However, the search giant did come under fire earlier this year when YouTube, its video site, allowed disturbing videos to infiltrate its official feeds for children. 
Although Google actively scans the Play store for malicious code, policing its vast, ever-evolving catalog of apps is a challenge. 
The company is ""struggling to keep certain malware outside the App store"" because some nasty code can only be detected by dynamically analyzing the context of an app's actions, which is hard to do, a Check Point researcher explains. 
""'AdultSwine' and other similar malware will likely be continually repeated and imitated by hackers,"" Check Point says. ""Users should be extra vigilant when installing apps, particularly those intended for use by children.""

 });Even as executives from Google and Facebook prepare to testify in front of the Senate on how they're combating extremist content, the internet giants are struggling to keep it off their sites. 
 Dozens of accounts on sites owned by those two companies have been used this week to promote violent attacks and recruit people to the cause of Islamic terrorism, a CNBC investigation has found.
All of the content that was brought to the attention of Google and Facebook by CNBC was removed within 24 hours of notification. Yet many of the posts and videos, which contained graphic images and threats of violence, had been online for days or weeks before we alerted them to it.
 Its presence on their pages underscores the enormous challenge these internet firms have in controlling content while remaining open platforms.
""Terrorists are using Google and Facebook technology to run what are essentially sophisticated social media marketing campaigns,"" said Eric Feinberg, co-founder of the Global Intellectual Property Enforcement Center, or GIPEC, which tracks extremist content online.
Extremist groups are using their tools the way brand advertisers and other online marketers do, cross-promoting videos on one account with posts on other social media services.
Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are sending representatives to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday morning to testify in front of the Senate Commerce Committee in a hearing titled  ""Terrorism and Social Media: #IsBigTechDoingEnough?""
CNBC initially discovered some of the violent videos and posts while reporting an earlier story on Facebook users who had been locked out of their accounts by hackers.
After that story was published, CNBC reported its findings to counter-terrorism officials at the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco, because some of the content appeared to include coded messages about potential attacks over the Christmas holiday. 
The office acknowledged receipt of our e-mail and said it couldn't comment further. 
We then contacted GIPEC, a cyber-intelligence firm whose patented software finds social media activity produced by criminals and terrorists, and asked Feinberg if the group could locate more violent and extremist content.
""There's plenty out there if you know how to look for it,"" said Feinberg, who previously ran an online marketing and ad-tech firm based in New York. ""These companies are playing whack-a-mole"" in their fight against extremism, he said.
 How to make a bomb out of a 7-Up bottle
 Many of the Facebook accounts used to promote terrorist-related content appeared to have been taken over by hackers -- similar to those accounts in our prior story.
For example, they showed images of war-ravaged cities in the Middle East, or had flags from countries in the region, even though the profile page indicated the user was from a faraway place like Mexico or Brazil.
The pages also contained recent posts in Arabic while earlier posts on the profile had been exclusively in English or Spanish.
One page provided instructions for turning an empty soda bottle into an improvised explosive device (IED) like those used to kill and maim U.S. soldiers during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 According to Google's online translation service, the Arabic text reads:
 ""An empty plastic box containing 15 yeast bags + 100 small size sharp nails. When the yeast is brewed after exposure to the sun, it will explode and the nails will spread splinters on the infidels. In the parks of the worshipers of the Cross."" 
Using Facebook's online reporting system, Feinberg notified the company of the page on Jan. 10, and it was soon removed.
Another page (which hasn't been reported) contains Islamist propaganda, including texts of speeches from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq who was killed by a U.S. airstrike in 2006. It's been up since at least Dec. 26.
Of the six profiles CNBC reported to Facebook on Wednesday afternoon, all were removed within a day.
In response to a request for comment as to why the pages hadn't been removed earlier, a Facebook spokesperson referred us to a November blog post titled,  ""Are we winning the war on terrorism online,""  from Monika Bickert, the company's global head of policy management.
""99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda-related terror content we remove from Facebook is content we detect before anyone in our community has flagged it to us, and in some cases, before it goes live on the site,"" the post said. ""Once we are aware of a piece of terror content, we remove 83% of subsequently uploaded copies within one hour of upload.""
Bickert is scheduled to appear before the Senate on Wednesday, alongside Juniper Downs, YouTube's global head of public policy and government relations, and Carlos Monje, Twitter's director of public policy and philanthropy.
 Promoting videos of an assassinated al Qaeda leader
 GIPEC found similar material on YouTube and Google Plus. 
One post, which violated Google's terms of service, pointed to videos made by Anwar al-Awlaki, an American of Yemeni descent who allegedly planned terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia before being killed by a drone strike in 2011.
 A YouTube spokesperson told CNBC that the company updated its rules last year to ban all content either promoted by or relating to individuals, including al-Awlaki, known to be members of the U.S. Department of State's list of foreign terrorist organizations.
YouTube published a blog post in December, saying that ""98 percent of the videos we remove for violent extremism are flagged by our machine-learning algorithms"" and that 70 percent is removed within eight hours of being uploaded. 
YouTube removed more than 150,000 videos for ""violent extremism"" between June and December of last year. The company sent CNBC the following statement:
 ""In June of last year we announced steps we are taking to combat violent extremism on YouTube, including better detection and faster removal of content, more expert partners to help identify content, and tougher standards. We've made progress with these efforts, with machine learning technology flagging content to help our reviewers remove nearly five times as many videos as they previously could. We're continuing to invest heavily in people, technology and strict policies to remove this content quickly.""  
While all six accounts we reported to Google were removed within 24 hours, other pages on the site still include terrorist propaganda.

 Celgene chief Alles discusses deal to acquire Impact Biomedicines, strategy for 2018   
 1:06  PM ET Mon,  8 Jan 2018 |  04:35 
 Celgene acquired a developer of cancer drugs, Impact Biomedicines, in a deal valued at up to $7 billion the companies announced on Sunday. The deal entails a $1.1 billion initial payment to the start-up, and more in phases if Impact's clinical trials bear out and the company attains regulatory approvals to move forward with treatments for a blood cancer called myelofibrosis. The deal represents a blockbuster of an exit for Impact's earlier investors. The company had raised $112 million, including $22 million in venture funding from Medicxi Ventures in London, and $90 million in debt financing from Oberland Capital.  
 Google has acquired a U.K.-based company called Redux Laboratories, which had 178 granted patents and 50 pending, as well as venture funding from Prosper Capital. Redux's flagship technology turns the surface of devices, including smartphones, into speakers. A regulatory filing from December 2017 showed that Google's Ireland subsidiary bought all the shares of NVF Tech, the parent company of Redux. The deal was completed around September last year, and terms weren't disclosed. 
 After 12 years and $157 million in venture funding, Practice Fusion was acquired by Allscripts, for $100 million. Practice Fusion created a free online platform that doctors could use to issue prescriptions, communicate with other healthcare providers, order labs and keep records of their patients' visits. The deal was a disappointing end for Practice Fusion's backers, who had at one time given the company a $1.5 billion valuation. Practice Fusion was backed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Morgenthaler Ventures, Felicis Ventures, an investment arm of OrbiMed and othaers. 
 Start-ups
 Sydney-based Canva raised $40 million in new venture funding and scored a post-money valuation of $1 billion, CEO and co-founder Melanie Perkins told CNBC. The deal makes Canva one of the few ""unicorns"" to hail from Australia, and one of the few led by a woman. Canva makes Web-based software that helps non-experts make pretty presentations, graphics or even light animations. Canva wants to topple PowerPoint. But the start-up also faces competition from Apple Keynote, Adobe Connect, and Prezi, another venture-funded company. Sequoia China was part of the new funding round.
Perkins told CNBC that people have created billboards, invitations, missing person posters and more with Canva, in addition to school reports, pitch decks and infographics. The new funding will help Canva expand to international audiences and develop new features and functionality.
""Our mission has been the same for years -- to empower everyone to design anything and publish anywhere,"" she said. ""We're getting closer to that goal, but haven't even done 1 percent of what's possible.""

 Jaguar's venture arm, InMotion Ventures, and Khosla Ventures invested in a $15 million round of funding for Voyage, as The Information first reported. The start-up has developed ""robo-taxis,"" a fleet of driverless cars that can be booked for a ride through an app. Voyage is testing out its autonomous transportation in San Jose, California, and will soon expand it to retirement communities in Florida. The company spun out of Udacity, an online school created by driverless car pioneer Sebastian Thrun. 
InMotion Ventures also invested $1 million in a Boston-based start-up called Sheprd the companies announced on Wednesday. Sheprd bills itself as an ""on-demand school bus."" Its drivers use Jaguar Land Rover SUVs to pick up groups of students and drop them off at school, soccer practice or other related activities. Parents pre-schedule the rides on an Uber-like app. Kids get picked up and dropped off directly at home or where they're expected and don't need to wait at public bus stops.
 Funds and Firms
 Renault Nissan and Mitsubishi announced plans to invest $1 billion over 5 years in driverless car and related autonomous and transportation technologies as Alliance Ventures.  According to a press statement from the alliance, ""The first deal will be a strategic investment in Ionic Materials, a US-based company developing solid-state cobalt-free battery materials.""

114,2018-01-16,Google plans to build 3 new underwater cables to expand its cloud business  How to use the new Google app that matches your face with famous paintings  The flu is officially a nationwide epidemic  This Google app matches your face with famous paintings  ,"Getty Images
Diane Greene, Google
 Google is planning to build three underwater cables in 2019 to help expand its cloud business to new regions as it battles rivals Microsoft and Amazon. 
 The subsea cables will run across different routes. The first will go from Los Angeles to Chile, the second will connect the U.S. to Denmark and Ireland, and the third will be from Hong Kong to Guam. 
Alphabet-owned Google said it will open its Netherlands and Montreal regions in the first quarter of 2018, followed by L.A., Finland and Hong Kong. 
 The cables will be completed in 2019. 
""Together, these investments further improve our network — the world's largest — which by some accounts delivers 25 percent of worldwide internet traffic,"" Ben Treynor Sloss, vice president of Google's cloud platform, said in a blog post on Tuesday. 
The Curie cable, named after famous scientist Marie Curie, from Chile to L.A. will allow Google to serve cloud customers across Latin America. 
Havfrue, the cable running from the U.S. to Denmark and Ireland, will boost capacity for North Atlantic customers. It is being developed in partnership with Facebook and will be built by TE SubCom. 
The Hong Kong-Guam cable system will help Google reach customers in Australia and the Pacific region. 
Building all of these cables will help Google deliver cloud services with a better experience. It means if servers in one region have a problem, then it can still service customers in those areas without taking a hit to performance. 
Google now has direct investment in 11 cables, including those planned or under construction.
The U.S. search giant sees cloud as a promising new area and has been trying to aggressively expand the business to catch up to rivals Amazon and Microsoft.

Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps at Google Inc., gestures as he speaks during the company's Android One smartphone launch event in New Delhi, India, on Monday, Sept. 15, 2014.
 As the amount of money that Chinese app users spend continues to swell at a break-neck pace, Google is missing out on a growing chunk of potential revenue because its Google Play app store is barred from that market, new data from App Annie shows.
 Chinese consumers spent nearly $35 billion on apps in 2017, marking a 270 percent in two years, with more aggressive growth likely ahead.
 However, it's only Apple and Chinese companies like Tencent and Baidu — which have their own Android app stores — that reap the benefits of that, since Google pulled search from China and had most of its services blocked back in 2010. (Although it's technically possible for Chinese smartphone users to access the Play Store via virtual private networks, data from 2017 shows that a tiny percentage actual go through the effort to do so.)
 Over the last eight years, Google has repeatedly tried to relaunch Play in China, to no avail. 
Meanwhile, App Annie predicts continued strong growth in China, calling the country a ""tale of two markets."" Some cities, like Beijing and Shanghai, have already reached advanced levels of app maturity while people in lower tier cities and rural areas are just starting to adopt smartphones. Google and Apple both take a 30 percent cut of app purchases, so as the pie grows bigger, so too would their slice.  
Google's most recent plans to relaunch a censored version of the Play Store in partnership with Chinese company Netease, reported by The Information, show that the company realizes the huge potential of this market. Alphabet doesn't break out what percentage of its revenue comes specifically from the Play Store — it lumps those together with money from its swelling cloud business and hardware sales.  In Q3 of 2017, Alphabet's so-called ""Other Google revenues"" hit $3.4 billion. 
Overall, smartphone users downloaded over 175 billion apps and spent more than $86 billion on them in 2017, according to App Annie, and the average spends 3 hours in apps every day.

 If your internet connection has been going down, your Google Home and Chromecast devices could be to blame. The  issue initially seemed to be relegated only to those who owned the Google Home Max speaker and TP-Link Archer C7 router.  New issues have been reported involving other devices by both companies, and with  routers from other brands, like Asus, Linksys, Netgear, and Synology.
The issue, according to TP-Link, stemmed from the line of Google Cast products. The Cast feature normally sends packets of information at regular intervals to keep a live connection with products like Google Home. However, if the device is awakened from a ""sleep"" mode, it will sometimes send a burst of information at once, which can overwhelm a router. The longer a Cast device has been in ""sleep"" mode, the more information it might send at once. According to the engineer, that could exceed over 100,000 packets, an amount that ""may eventually cause some of router's primary features to shut down — including wireless connectivity.""
TP-Link has fixed the issue in one model of its router, the C1200, but a broader fix from Google's end has not been found. Google tells  9to5Google it is ""working quickly to share a solution,"" but as of now, the only recourse would be to reboot your router if you encounter this problem or disconnect your Cast device altogether if it's not in use.

Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene.
 Google's growing cloud business is trying to bring artificial intelligence to the masses, not just to the experts.
 The move follows a pattern of cloud players attempting to use ready-to-go AI services as a way to lure companies to use more of their services. Google has used AI in several parts of its business, and now the company is looking to make the technology easier for many people to adopt, which could boost Google's cloud effort as a whole.
On Wednesday the company introduced a tool that's designed to simplify the process of deploying AI in business applications. It's called Cloud AutoML, and it's already being used by companies including Disney and Urban Outfitters to make search and shopping on their websites more relevant.
 Cloud AutoML is starting with image recognition, allowing customers to drag in images and train their systems to recognize them on Google's cloud.
""Currently, only a handful of businesses in the world have access to the talent and budgets needed to fully appreciate the advancements of ML and AI,"" Jia Li, head of research and development for Google's cloud AI unit, and Fei-Fei Li, the group's chief scientist, wrote in a blog post. ""We believe Cloud AutoML will make AI experts even more productive, advance new fields in AI and help less-skilled engineers build powerful AI systems they previously only dreamed of.""
Cloud AutoML Vision can figure out what's inside images that users upload, train a model based on those images, provide analysis of the model, and then start to make sense of new images as they come in, based on what it has learned. The new service joins Google's Cloud Machine Learning Engine and its Cloud Vision application programming interface but unlike those products, the Cloud AutoML portfolio wasn't designed just with developers in mind.
Two months ago, cloud market leader Amazon Web Services introduced Amazon SageMaker for building and launching their own AI models. And last May, Microsoft introduced a service for customizing image recognition models. Google had 12 percent public cloud market share in the fourth quarter, KeyBanc analysts said last week.
Like Amazon and Microsoft, Google also offers developer tools for speech recognition and language translation, although they are not as easy to customize as the new Cloud AutoML tool.
Early results suggest that the new system works better than Google's past methods of image recognition, Jia Li said in a media briefing. The technology was developed through collaboration with multiple other internal AI teams, she said.

 Social media giants battle extremist content   
 12:00  PM ET Wed, 17 Jan 2018 |  04:31 
 Facebook, Google and Twitter told Congress Wednesday that they've gone beyond screening and removing extremist content and are creating more anti-terror propaganda to pre-empt violent messages at the source.
 Representatives from the three companies told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that they are, among other things, targeting people likely to be swayed by extremist messages and pushing content aimed at countering that message. Several senators criticized their past efforts as not going far enough.
""We believe that a key part of combating extremism is preventing recruitment by disrupting the underlying ideologies that drive people to commit acts of violence. That's why we support a variety of counterspeech efforts,"" said Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management, according to an advance copy of her testimony obtained by CNBC.
 Bickert said that in addition to using image matching and language analysis to identify terror content before it's posted, the company is ramping up what it calls ""counterspeech.""
Facebook is also working with universities, nongovernmental organizations and community groups around the world ""to empower positive and moderate voices,"" Bickert said.
Google's YouTube, meanwhile, says it will continue to use what it calls the ""Redirect Method,"" developed by Google's Jigsaw research group, to send anti-terror messages to people likely to seek out extremist content through what is essentially targeted advertising. If YouTube determines that a person may be headed toward extremism based on their search history, it will serve them ads that subtly contradict the propaganda that they might see from ISIS or other such groups. Meanwhile, YouTube supports ""Creators for Change,"" a group of people who use their channels to counteract hate.
 ""We believe that a key part of combating extremism is preventing recruitment by disrupting the underlying ideologies that drive people to commit acts of violence.""
-Monika Bickert , Facebook's head of global policy management
 The video site is also adapting how it deals with videos that are offensive but don't technically violate its community guidelines, putting this so-called borderline content behind interstitials and removing comments, according to the testimony of Juniper Downs, YouTube's head of public policy.
Downs said that over the past year YouTube's algorithms, in concert with human reviewers, have been able to remove hateful content faster than before.
""Our advances in machine learning let us now take down nearly 70% of violent extremism content within 8 hours of upload and nearly half of it in 2 hours,"" Downs said.
Twitter's Carlos Monje Jr., director of public policy and philanthropy in the U.S. and Canada, said the company has participated in more than 100 trainings events since 2015 on countering extremist content.
Those training sessions included events in Beirut, Bosnia, Belfast and Brussels and summits at the White House, the United Nations and in London and Sydney, Monje said in his prepared testimony.
 Tech companies under fire from lawmakers
 The U.S.-based tech giants have come under fire in the U.S. and Europe for allowing their websites to be used by Islamic terrorists and other extremists for recruiting and propaganda.
The German government passed a law last year that fines internet companies for allowing hate speech to remain on a site for more than 24 hours. Leaders in France and the U.K., which have suffered a series of terrorist attacks, have threatened similar action.
Now the companies are feeling the heat in Washington after revelations that extremists are using their services to recruit and target Americans.
A November report from New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights estimated the Islamic terrorist group ISIS generated 200,000 social media messages every day.
An investigation by CNBC, meanwhile, found dozens of accounts on Facebook and Google Plus being used by terrorists to promote their message. Some of those accounts had been taken over by hackers first.
All three firms said last year they were adding more workers to screen content and boosting investment in software that uses artificial intelligence to find and remove violent posts and videos.
They also created an industry-wide group, the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, to share data on extremist groups. The forum said in December its database had 40,000 images and videos which it was using to screen content from their sites.
""Social media companies realize the damage of these bad actors far too late,"" says Clint Watts, the Robert A. Fox Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, who is also scheduled to testify at Wednesday's hearing.

116,2018-01-18,"The 50 most innovative companies to work for in 2018  Apple, Google shuttle buses in Silicon Valley attacked  ","For the second consecutive year, Apple and Google topped the list of the 50 most innovative companies, according to the Boston Consulting Group.
 The companies at the top of the list shifted just slightly from last year. Microsoft jumped up by one spot to take third place, while electric-car company Tesla fell from No. 3 to sixth place. Retail giant Amazon climbed from fifth place to fourth place, and Netflix, which made the top 10 in 2017, fell to No. 13.
In the most recent report, two new companies managed to push their way into the top 10: ride-hailing app Uber and e-commerce site Alibaba.
 Geographically, North America produced the most innovative companies, with 27 featured on the list. Europe produced 16 entrants, up from 10 last year.
The travel and transportation sector also expanded its showing on the 2018 list, with companies such as Uber, Tesla, SpaceX and Airbnb included.

 The firm found that the most innovative companies have been fueled by digital technologies. For example, they prioritize mobile products, digital design, big data and also quickly adapt to technological advances. They also tend to develop and test new products faster and more cheaply than other companies.
According to the research, the biggest difference between the most innovative companies and the companies that appear much lower on the list is how heavily they have incorporated these digital processes into their businesses. 
""While 79 percent of strong innovators reported that they had properly digitized innovation processes, only 29 percent of weak innovators make the same claim,"" the study reports.

 Last year, the most innovative companies were those that brought in new ideas from outside sources such as social media and had open and collaborative work environments.
Finally, the research notes that business leaders at the most innovative companies do five key things that set them apart from their competition:
1. Leaders dedicate resources: They realize the importance of digital and invest accordingly.
2. Leaders invest in speed: They test ideas earlier and launch products quickly.
3. Leaders take smart risks: They make big bets that are high-risk but also high-reward.
4. Leaders invest in data: They mine and analyze data to glean insight for their products.
5. Leaders secure top talent: They acquire and develop talent across the company.

Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square
 Payment company Square is ""analogous to Amazon or Google in their early days"" but Wall Street is valuing the stock all wrong, according to Nomura Instinet
 The firm reiterated its buy rating on the company's stock on Friday, calling big gains in 2018 as the company disrupts the payments industry.
The San Francisco-based company's climb to fame is a result of its financial transaction technology, enabling small businesses to accept card payments through its software and hardware products. It also developed Square Cash, a means of sending and receiving money between individuals and businesses akin to PayPal's Venmo.
 ""In 10 years, Square is likely to be a very different company helped by accelerating share gains from payment peers and relentless disruption of services like payroll and HR,"" analyst Dan Dolev wrote in a note to clients. Valuation should include ""mix shift to large sellers, accelerating share gains, growing penetration of higher priced transaction types like virtual terminal and e-commerce, as well as high margin services like Square Capital and payroll.""
In all, added Dolev, a surge in gross payment volume — a key industry metric — should help ensure Square has another ""phenomenal year.""
The analyst's $64 price target represents 59 percent upside from Thursday's close over the next year, the highest target on Wall Street according to FactSet data. Shares rallied 4.8 percent Friday morning.
Dolev believes his peers on Wall Street don't see this bright future for Square because they are using ""conventional valuation methodologies."" The analyst is using a discounted cash flow model to come up with his target.
Square shares are up 173 percent over the past 12 months. 
The company topped Wall Street expectations in its latest earnings report and CEO Jack Dorsey, who also leads social media site Twitter, told investors that Square's growth runway looks strong.
""As we continue to grow up-market, we've learned that more complex sellers often have established systems that they've tailored to their businesses, such as e-commerce websites, custom points of sale, or inventory software,"" he said during the earnings call. ""With our open platform, developers can connect these systems with Square and give sellers the ability to manage them in one place.""

Sundar Pichai
 Google CEO Sundar Pichai has no regrets about firing James Damore, the engineer responsible for a controversial diversity-related memo last fall, though he said the way it played out in public was unfortunate.
 ""I regret that people misunderstand that we made this decision because of a political belief one way or another,"" Pichai said on Friday in a filmed discussion with MSNBC and Recode. Pichai said he wished the story hadn't made it to the public ""in such a polarized way.""
Damore's memo, which circulated internally at Google before leaking to the press, claimed that there were fewer women in technology in part because of biological differences. The company fired him soon after, stating that parts of the memo were contrary to Google's ""basic values"" and code of conduct.
 The firing sparked a debate, with some celebrating Google's swift action and others outraged at the company for allegedly defending political correctness at the expense of free speech and ideological diversity.
New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that Pichai should resign for how he handled the situation. Earlier this month, Damore even filed a lawsuit accusing the company of discriminating against conservative men. 
Pichai said on Friday that Google didn't view the issue through a political lens, and rather made its decision to ensure that all employees felt comfortable at the company. 
YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, who was also on stage for the interview, agreed that the firing was the ""right decision.""

 });If you don't know how to code, fret not, you can still have a successful career in a tech-powered job.
 So says the CEO of Google, Sundar Pichai.
While education and workplace training for an automated future has focused largely on coding, there will be many jobs that depend on softer tech skills, Pichai says in an  essay published Thursday on NBCNews.com.
 ""When you think of how to help our workforce thrive and find opportunities in the digital world, the first word that often comes to mind is 'code.' Nearly every digital-skills program over the past decade has focused on computer science, with a lot of emphasis on young students,"" says Pichai.
""But the focus on code has left a potentially bigger opportunity largely unexplored.""

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 Softer-skilled, mid-level jobs are being rapidly digitized and automated and training needs to stay nimble and be a constant through your career, Pichai says.
""In the past, people were educated, and learned job skills, and that was enough for a lifetime. Now, with technology changing rapidly and new job areas emerging and transforming constantly, that's no longer the case,"" says Pichai.
""We need to focus on making lightweight, continuous education widely available. This is just as crucial to making sure that everyone can find opportunities in the future workplace.""
 There is a huge opportunity to rethink training for jobs. With technology changing rapidly and new job areas emerging and transforming constantly, we need to focus on making lightweight, continuous education widely available.
 Office admins, for example, today need a robust cadre of digital skills. They schedule and take care of budgeting and accounting online. There need to be training programs for workers to learn these skills, says Pichai. And they don't need to be formal degree programs.
""The digital skills necessary to do these jobs are far easier to learn than code, and should be easier to deliver at scale,"" says Pichai, who points to a  November 2017 Brookings Institute report showing jobs with ""medium-digital"" skills in America have grown from 40 percent of jobs in 2002 to 48 percent of jobs in 2016.
Another job tech-powered job category that doesn't require the ability to code but that does require some amount of technical education is IT support, says Pichai.
""IT support is a clear opportunity, here. Just as anyone has a clear path to becoming an auto-mechanic, we need a similar path to the 150,000 open positions for IT support, in which people maintain the machines and software that underpin technology services. Yet no training today efficiently connects people to that opportunity,"" says Pichai.
All this is not to undermine the importance of coding, but to suggest there is another, parallel track for tech skills training critical to getting the workforce ready for the future.
""Moving beyond code and intensive degrees to these constant, lightweight and ubiquitous forms of education will take resources and experimentation,"" writes Pichai. ""We should make sure that the next generation of jobs are good jobs, in every sense. Rather than thinking of education as the opening act, we need to make sure it's a constant, natural and simple act across life — with lightweight, flexible courses, skills and programs available to everyone.""

118,2018-01-22,"Google's $20 million race to the moon will end with no winner — and Google is OK with that  Facebook, Google promote 'scurrilous' news, and should pay for quality content, said Rupert Murdoch  ","More than ten years after it was announced — and extended over and over — the Google-sponsored race to win $20 million by landing on the moon will end with no winners.
 The four teams racing to win the Google Lunar Xprize, which requires a company to land a spacecraft on the moon by March 31, are either short of money or unable to launch this year, three people familiar with the matter told CNBC.
Meanwhile, Google — which extended the deadline from 2014 to 2015 and then eventually to 2018 — is not willing to push out the date further.
 ""Google does not have plans at this time to extend the deadline again, however we are so thrilled with the progress made by these teams over the last ten years,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. 
The Xprize Foundation, the independent organization overseeing the contest, declined CNBC's requests for comment. 
The commercial space industry has written off the Lunar Xprize as improbable, and not worth pursuing, according to sources. While the competition's era may be coming to a close, the ""New Space"" industry is only just beginning. A market exists in a way that it did not 10 years ago, and predictions of it ballooning into a multi-trillion dollar economy are increasing.
Lunar Xprize spurred the creation of numerous companies, which made steps that were thought impossible before.
 The teams competing to the end
 Four teams around the world have been racing to complete spacecrafts capable of landing on and exploring the moon's surface. However, none are close enough to launch for Google to justify extending the deadline.
Team SpaceIL is short on funding and the other three — Moon Express, TeamIndus and Synergy Moon — will not be ready to launch this year.
SpaceIL. ""We'll be ready to launch somewhere in 2018,"" SpaceIL CEO Eran Privman told CNBC. ""But we would definitely like it to move back. No one will be able to launch by the end of March.""
The Israeli nonprofit needed to raise $7.5 million by the end of 2017 to pay for its launch contract, building and testing of its lunar craft, as well as payments for its engineers and partners. SpaceIL said that if it did not raise the funding, it will forfeit the launch contract it currently has, causing the team to drop out of the competition.
""Give us another few months — until the end of 2018,"" Privman said of the Lunar Xprize deadline.
SpaceIL did not respond to multiple CNBC requests for comment after the fundraising deadline passed.
TeamIndus. The next closest competitor to SpaceIL is TeamIndus, according to two people familiar with the matter.
TeamIndus entered into an agreement in December 2016 with Japanese Team Hakuto to launch both team's rovers aboard an Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) rocket. However, on January 11, Team Hakuto announced that TeamIndus had not been able to agree with ISRO on a launch date to send the rovers to the moon.
""It is now deemed difficult to launch [the rovers] before the race deadline of March 31,"" Hakuto said in a statement.
Team Hakuto was originally a separate effort from Japanese start-up ispace. A Hakuto spokesperson confirmed to CNBC the team's rover arrived at the TeamIndus facility on Dec. 19, for pre-launch inspections.
TeamIndus declined CNBC's request for comment.
Moon Express is ""still hoping to launch the lander next year,"" but has said that the competition is not the company's main priority. The company has won more than $600,000 under NASA's Innovative Lunar Demonstration Data Program, and $1.25 million as a part of previous milestones of the Lunar Xprize.
The company has an existing five-launch contract with Rocket Lab, which completed the second test of its Electron vehicle on Saturday. The rocket reached orbit for the first time, deploying a payload of micro-satellites. However, a person familiar with the Electron rocket said the Moon Express lander is too heavy for the Electron rocket, making it physically impossible to put the spacecraft into an orbit capable of reaching the moon.
Moon Express declined CNBC's request for comment, instead pointing to a recent Space News op-ed by CEO Bob Richards titled ""applauding the Google Lunar Xprize.""

 Synergy Moon has a launch agreement with Interorbital Systems to use a Neptune 8 rocket, which the latter company has not yet built or tested. The Interorbital rocket currently undergoing testing is a sounding rocket — meaning it cannot even reach Earth orbit, much less making it to the moon.
Synergy Moon did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.
 Success without a winner
 While the $20 million grand prize will go unclaimed, those familiar with the Lunar Xprize and the teams involved were still positive about what was accomplished.
Over $6 million in milestone prizes were awarded to teams over the past few years, as competitors demonstrated various concepts and capabilities. Teams demonstrated hardware and software capable of landing, moving around and capturing images on the moon. These showed what is possible with next generation technology, developed at a fraction of the cost of previous government missions. 
Google has struggled to figure out what to do with the Lunar Xprize, said a source with knowledge of the company's relationship with Xprize. 
The relationship started with noble intentions. Back in 2007, when Xprize founder Dr. Peter Diamandis was looking for other backers, he overheard a conversation by Google co-founder Sergey Brin about space. Diamandis then convinced several Google executives to back the prize.
Google came on board, but Brin never undertook it as a personal project and the technology giant largely stayed out of the competition's operations. The program essentially fell between departments and, on a Google scale, it was a small venture to fund.
When it was clear no team would be ready for the original 2014 deadline, the Foundation convinced Google to extend it to 2015. According to the Foundation, the Lunar Xprize was then extended two more times: to the end of 2017 and finally to March 2018.
Additionally, a few years after the prize's announcement, water was discovered in mass amounts on the moon's surface. Mining in space is a moonshot which may quickly become both doable and profitable, and commercial companies are now building spacecraft to recover water for use as fuel. They have tens of millions in backing to do so.
Success, for the ventures in the competition, was reaching the moon's surface — winning the prize would have been just a bonus.

Rupert Murdoch
 Rupert Murdoch said on Monday that Facebook and Google have made ""scurrilous"" news sources popular, and that the U.S. tech giants should pay publishers if they want ""trusted"" content.
 ""Facebook and Google have popularized scurrilous news sources through algorithms that are profitable for these platforms but inherently unreliable,"" the News Corp. chairman said in a statement.
""If Facebook wants to recognize 'trusted' publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies,"" Murdoch said.
 The statement comes after Facebook said Friday it would survey its users about what news sources they trust, and tweak its ranking software to help promote more the credible ones.
In his own Facebook post last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, ""I've asked our product teams to make sure we prioritize news that is trustworthy, informative, and local. And we're starting next week with trusted sources.""
Facebook and Google have been gobbling up an ever-larger chunk of the digital ad market. The two companies are expected to post combined sales of just over $185 billion in 2018, based on Wall Street estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters.
Murdoch says the two companies should pay to ensure their users get quality journalism.
""Recognition of a problem is one step on the pathway to cure, but the remedial measures that both companies have so far proposed are inadequate, commercially, socially and journalistically.
""There has been much discussion about subscription models but I have yet to see a proposal that truly recognizes the investment in and the social value of professional journalism. We will closely follow the latest shift in Facebook's strategy, and I have no doubt that Mark Zuckerberg is a sincere person, but there is still a serious lack of transparency that should concern publishers and those wary of political bias at these powerful platforms,"" Murdoch wrote.
News Corp. bought Facebook rival MySpace for $580 million in 2005 and sold it for $35 million six years later.

 A 'clash' between globalization and America First at Davos?   
 12:41  AM ET Tue, 23 Jan 2018 |  06:35 
 Amazon is threatening Google and Facebook's dominance of the digital ad space, Martin Sorrell told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday.
 The CEO of WPP, the world's largest ad company, explained why he saw a growth trajectory ahead for the American e-commerce giant's ad business. 
""Amazon threatens Google in two ways. One is search — 55 percent of product searches in the United States emanate from Amazon. So that's a big question for Google,"" Sorrell said.
 Still, Amazon's market share doesn't come close to the duopoly of Facebook and Google. The two tech and media behemoths control about 75 percent of the digital ad space, Sorrell said.
""Amazon's advertising platform itself — Google has about $100 billion in advertising, Facebook about $40 billion. Amazon has a fairly paltry pimple really, $2 billion or so, but growing quite quickly.""
The advertising tycoon said he spent about $5 billion with Google last year, roughly $2 billion at Facebook and $200 million on Amazon on behalf of WPP's clients. 
""This year we'll be ramping up to about $300 million,"" Sorrell said, ""so it's growing, but it's at a very small scale.""

 'Techlash'
 Sorrell also spoke about the issue of ""techlash,"" the rising tide of popular discontent with the ever-expanding reach of global technology companies. There are ""big issues"" surrounding privacy and employment in this realm, the British CEO described.
""A large reason for the rise of populism on both sides of Atlantic surrounds these issues around privacy and certainly about jobs, and how the economy will develop at a time when technology is becoming increasingly important.""""Yesterday, we had Amazon launching its employee-less store in Seattle,"" Sorrell noted. ""And the big question is does automation — do improvements in technology — actually create jobs, destroy them or keep them the same?""
Sorrell took over WPP as a small British wire shopping cart company in 1986, serving as its chief executive since that year. Its revenue in 2016 was more than $20 billion.

 });Your relationship with your manager is important. Besides making decisions about your compensation, they teach you new skills and can help you achieve your own career goals.
 But not everyone has a thriving relationship with their manager. In fact, a 2015  Gallup survey of more than 7,000 people found that 50 percent had left a job to ""get away from their manager.""
So what do you do if you feel your boss doesn't exactly like you? Jenny Blake, career coach, co-founder of Google's mentorship program and author of the career guide ""Pivot: The Only Move that Matters is Your Next One,"" has some advice.
 Source: Mark Hanauer  
 Blake suggests the ""EAR formula,"" which stands for ""event, action, result.""
Instead of letting fear or frustration bottle up, use the method to start an honest and professional conversation with your boss.

 });
 First, pinpoint a recent event that made you feel like your boss dislikes you. Recall what happened or the action that took place and then how it made you feel.
""For example"" Blake says, ""when you were at the team meeting, your manager said a comment that was hurtful to you and the result was you were left feeling discouraged.""

 Once you've thought about it yourself, try bringing it up with your manager in your next one-on-one meeting, Blake says.
You can say something like, ""I feel that something may be off between us and I wanted to check in around it,"" she says. Then, if your manager asks for examples, you can discuss the interaction or interactions you thought about previously.
""Most often,"" Blake says, ""this is a simple misunderstanding and a difference in communication styles. So approach it from as neutral a position as you can.""
Hopefully, your manager will talk about a solution and you'll be able to walk out of the meeting feel more secure about the relationship. If you don't, it might be time to get advice from your HR representative or look to move either within or outside of your company.

 Google's Play Store is making a bigger push into selling audiobooks, the company announced Tuesday, putting it in more direct competition with Amazon-owned Audible. 
 This move is particularly important as both Google and Amazon continue pushing their smart-speaker lines, the Home and Echo respectively. Right now, there's no integration between the Google Home and Amazon's Audible and Google's audiobooks won't play on the Echo. While both Home and Echo integrate with a large variety of outside services, they're becoming walled gardens against each other's content. As consumers decide which speaker to purchase, they may be swayed by whichever device gives them easier access to their audiobooks, or they'll buy audiobooks from whichever company makes their speaker. 
The company is rolling out a dedicated audiobook store on Play and the Google Play Books app works with both Android and iOS. 
 Google won't offer a subscription pricing plan like Audible does. Audible's cheapest subscription tier is one book a month for $14.95, which shaves as much as $10 off the price of a standalone audiobook. With Google, you can buy books only on a one-off basis.
Google launches the service with a handful of big discounts on titles such as ""Why Not Me?"" by Mindy Kaling ($5.99 on Google versus $21 on Audible without a subscription) or ""Lincoln in the Bardo"" by George Saunders ($8.99 on Google versus $24.50 on Audible without a subscription).
While it will take a deep-dive after the discounts expire to get a full pricing comparison, it seems that Google is trying to appeal to customers who don't read enough to want to buy into Audible's subscription model. 
Clarification: A previous version of this story said that the Play Store sold a ""small selection of audiobooks"" but a spokesperson denies that it classified any content previously available as audiobooks.

 The Xprize Foundation announced Tuesday its Google-sponsored race to win $20 million by landing on the moon will end with no victors. 
 The foundation says it expected ""a winner by now"" but remaining fundraising, technical and regulatory hurdles mean the Lunar Xprize ""will go unclaimed.""
""We are extraordinarily grateful to Google for enabling this 10-year journey with us and for having the foresight and courage to support and catalyze the commercial space industry, which was the ultimate goal of this competition,"" Xprize founder Peter Diamandis and CEO Marcus Shingles said in a statement.
 The announcement confirms CNBC reporting Monday that the race would end without a winner, as the teams remaining would be unable to launch in time for the March 31 deadline. In addition, Google — which extended the deadline from 2014 to 2015 and then eventually to 2018 — is not willing to push the date out further.
Diamandis and Shingles say the foundation is ""exploring a number of ways"" to move forward, including finding a replacement sponsor or simply continuing to support the teams' efforts through public promotion.

(L-R) Amazon's chief Jeff Bezos, Larry Page of Alphabet, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower December 14, 2016.
 Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google cumulatively racked up a roughly $50 million tab fighting off President Donald Trump and an onslaught of new federal regulations last year — a reflection that the tech industry is increasingly under political siege in the nation's capital.
Over the course of 2017, the biggest brands in tech warred with the White House over immigration, tried and failed to save net neutrality and weathered a congressional investigation into the ways in which Russian trolls spread propaganda on their sites during the last election.
The heightened scrutiny and withering criticism — targeting tech on everything from sex trafficking to fake news — prompted many companies to spend more money than ever to lobby the government, according to official ethics forms filed at midnight. And yet the industry's political activities in 2017 may only presage a tougher and costlier clash with Washington, D.C., in the year to come.
 Tech's most prolific political spender last year was Google, which dedicated more than $18 million to lobby the U.S. government. That's more than its tech peers, not to mention much of corporate America.
More from Recode:
 Here's why people on Twitter are seeing news alerts that they didn't ask for  Netflix now has nearly 118 million streaming subscribers globally  Bitcoin broker Coinbase booked $1 billion in revenue last year — so the company has told hovering VCs to back off 
Like other tech giants, Google sought to stave off new regulations targeting the content and ads that appeared on sites and services like search and YouTube. Meanwhile, the company pitched its own wares,  like self-driving cars, as lawmakers and other federal officials debated the new technology.
Amazon, meanwhile, spent more than $12.8 million in lobbying last year — nearly four times what it spent four years earlier — as it continued to advocate for friendlier federal rules around everything from online sales taxes and cloud computing to package-delivering drones. The company also had to contend in 2017 with fresh questions about the size of its corporate footprint, particularly after acquiring Whole Foods.
Facebook spent a record amount last year — roughly $11.5 million — as lawmakers railed on the social giant for the ""fake news"" and other content that appeared in users' feeds.
And Apple shelled out $7 million — again, more than ever — to lobby the U.S. government over the same period. The iPhone giant continued to press forward on issues like encryption and immigration. And the company — like the rest of the industry — advocated for the tax reform law recently signed by Trump.
Apple and Facebook declined to comment for this story; Amazon and Google did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
For much of tech, the industry's tough 2017 began as soon as Trump entered the White House and signed an executive order restricting immigrants and refugees from majority-Muslim countries. While federal courts later tossed that initial directive, Trump's early, aggressive stance on immigration only foreshadowed further restrictions, including those targeting  high-skilled foreign workers and their spouses.
More recently, tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have tapped their vast lobbying armies to  revive a program known as DACA. Scrapped by Trump in 2017, it had protected young immigrants who had been brought illegally to the U.S. as children from being deported. The future of DACA fed a stalemate in Congress this January that briefly caused the U.S. government to shut down.
Web companies, meanwhile, faced unfamiliar calls for fresh regulation in the nation's capital last year. For Facebook, Google and Twitter, it primarily came in the form of an investigation that found that hundreds of millions of their U.S. users had  fallen victim to Russian disinformation during the 2016 election..
In response, some lawmakers sought new federal rules governing the way that tech companies display political ads. But Facebook, Google and Twitter each devoted their seemingly limitless  lobbying resources toward fighting the measure, called the Honest Ads Act, as their federal disclosures show.
So, too, did that trio fight a proposal to hold social-media companies, ad networks and others accountable for enabling — or even failing to spot —  sex trafficking on their platforms. And these and other tech players lobbied extensively last year to  save the U.S. government's net neutrality rules, which the Federal Communications Commission ultimately scrapped in December anyway.
Those three fights — political ads, sex trafficking and net neutrality — remain unresolved at the beginning of 2018. Meanwhile, lawmakers and federal regulators are beginning to question the social costs of the digital age. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, for one, has emerged as one of  the more vocal critics of the ""downsides"" of social media.
Of course, the tech industry didn't totally lose in Trump's Washington last year. A major tax reform bill signed into law seems guaranteed to lessen tech giants' annual bills to the feds. To that end, Apple — a longtime advocate for tax reform — announced this month that it would reinvest billions of dollars in the United States.
Meanwhile, Uber also spent slightly more to lobby lawmakers and federal regulators last year. The ride-hailing giant in 2017 had to contend with a major executive shakeup, a series of allegations about sexism, multiple investigations into its business practices and a  major data security breach that it initially withheld from federal investigators.
Less known, however, is that the company began to lobby in Washington, D.C. for the first time on issues related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPPA. The 1996 law governs the privacy and security of medical information, and Uber declined to explain to Recode why it hired a lobbyist last year specifically to focus on the issue.
So too did Uber begin to share with federal regulators its ""advancements in vertical take-off and landing technology,"" or VTOL. Remember,  Uber has been exploring for years whether it's possible to fly its users around cities.

A visual representation of the digital Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, displayed on December 23, 2017 in Paris, France.
 Hackers are targeting app stores from the likes of Apple and Google with malicious cryptocurrency apps to steal money and personal data, according to a study.
 Researchers at cybersecurity firm RiskIQ analyzed more than 18,000 apps to detect ones that are blacklisted by cybersecurity vendors.
Their research found that 661 blacklisted cryptocurrency apps were found across 20 app stores including Apple's App Store, Google Play and others.
 Google Play hosted the highest amount of malicious crypto apps, the report said, with 272 available for download on the app store.
""We are seeing threat actors around the world exploiting what is already a hostile currency in a lawless digital world,"" Fabian Libeau, EMEA vice-president of RiskIQ, said in a statement Wednesday.
""Before handing over any cash or personal data, investors should carry out thorough research into the exchange and wallet apps they intend to use. By checking the developer's name, user reviews and the number of app downloads, investors can measure the validity of an app and be more confident in their choice.""
Hackers have used apps including phrases like ""bitcoin exchange,"" ""bitcoin wallet"" and ""cryptocurrency"" to lure potential victims, according to the report.
Cybersecurity has become an increasing concern for the cryptocurrency industry as interest in bitcoin and other digital coins has soared.
Last month, cryptocurrency mining network Nice Hash admitted to being hacked in a cyber-breach that saw tens of millions of dollars' worth of digital tokens stolen. In the same month, Yapian, the owner of South Korea's Youbit exchange, filed for bankruptcy following a hack that saw 17 percent of its cryptocurrency holdings stolen.
Apple and Google were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.

Steve Yegge
 A Google engineer who just left the company after nearly 13 years criticized it Wednesday for becoming ""100% competitor-focused"" and said the company ""can no longer innovate."" 
 Steve Yegge, who joined Google from Amazon in 2005, wrote  a blog post about his decision to quit the company, saying it has become too focused on competitors instead of customers. He said product launches such as its smart speaker, Home, its chat app Allo and its Android Instant Apps copy Amazon Echo, Facebook-owned WhatsApp and WeChat, respectively.
""Google has become 100% competitor-focused rather than customer focused,"" he wrote. ""They've made a weak attempt to pivot from this, with their new internal slogan 'Focus on the user and all else will follow.' But unfortunately it's just lip service.""
 He said employees don't set aside enough time to regularly interact with customers, instead relying on competitor activity to guide decisions about what people want.

 In an email to CNBC, Yegge said: ""My only comment is that this was my own personal viewpoint and does not represent the opinions or position of Google.""
This isn't the first time that Yegge — known for creating Grok, a service for Google developers — has publicly lambasted the company. In 2011, he wrote a harsh criticism of the social network Google Plus which was meant to be internal but was accidentally posted publicly (on Google Plus). In it, he called Google's attempt at a social network ""a prime example of our complete failure to understand platforms from the very highest levels of executive leadership."" The write-up circulated widely (even  Google co-founder Sergey Brin saw it), but Yegge's posting mistake didn't cost him his job.
He wrote this new blog post after deciding to join the Southeast Asian ride-hailing company Grab — and focuses the second part of it on describing why that company is so innovative.
Although he highlights Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car company, and TensorFlow, Google's open-source software, as being exciting products, his main point is that Google has lost its ability to innovate as its various rivalries take precedence.
The competition playing out most obviously in recent months has been between Amazon and Google. The two companies have had a  race to the bottom on cloud pricing, and spats around their respective smart speakers, with Google blocking YouTube from working on Amazon's FireTV and Amazon  refusing to sell Google's products. Google also just launchedits own audiobook service instead of integrating its smart speaker with Amazon's offering.

 });Scoring a job at Google is considered the ultimate feat. But for one longtime engineer, working at the tech giant is no longer worth the hype.
 In a  5000-word blog post, former senior software engineer Steve Yegge, who previously worked at Amazon, says that his decision to leave the company came as a surprise even to him.
""I always thought I would die at Google  —  maybe choking to death on one of their free chocolate brownies,"" he writes. But after 13 years at the company, says Yegge, Google is no longer the innovative tech haven it once was.
 CNBC has reached out to Google for comment.
Here are the five reasons he decided to leave the tech giant, according to Yegge's post:

 });
 1. 'They're conservative'
 Yegge says that Google is extremely focused on protecting their technology and ideas. This has led to a fear of risk-taking, Yegge writes, which is essential to ""real innovation.""
""Gatekeeping and risk aversion at Google,"" he writes, ""are the norm rather the exception.""
 2. 'They are mired in politics'
 Yegge admits that company politics is pretty much unavoidable at any large corporation. Plus, he writes, it's better than its alternative: a dictatorship.
But even though politics within a company isn't all bad, according to Yegge, it does create a ""cumbersome process.""
""It slows you down and leads to execution problems,"" he writes.
 3. 'Google is arrogant'
 For the most part, Google employs humble individuals, writes Yegge, but the company as a whole is arrogant.
Yegge says that the tech giant's rapid rise to success has turned the organization into one that feels invincible.
So although the individual employees are extremely intelligent and ""badass,"" he writes, the overall company suffers from ""complacency, not-invented-here syndrome, loss of touch with customers [and] poor strategic decision-making.""

 4. 'Their attempts at innovation have been confusing'
 Yegge says that anyone who's been following the tech giant has witnessed their many failed innovation attempts over the years.
""Google does all sorts of things these days that leave everyone scratching their heads,"" he writes.
He points to the company trying to force products on consumers, launching products that receive heavy criticism and getting rid of popular services.
The company's employees aren't blind to this conundrum either, according to the engineer. ""Googlers know this is happening and are as frustrated by it as you are,"" writes Yegge, ""but their leadership is failing them.""
 5. 'Google has become 100% competitor-focused'
 Google's worst sin, says Yegge, is that they've shifted from focusing on the customer to focusing on the competition.
Yegge writes that Google has made a ""weak attempt"" to re-shift its focus back to the consumer with their new slogan: ""Focus on the customer and all else will follow.""
However, he writes that the company is all talk and no action because Google continues to incentivize a focus on what its competitors are doing.
""In short, Google just isn't a very inspiring place to work anymore,"" writes Yegge. ""I love being fired up by my work, but Google had gradually beaten it out of me.""

 Soros: Trump has US 'set on a course towards nuclear war'   
 11:22  AM ET Fri, 26 Jan 2018 |  00:49 
 Billionaire investor George Soros bashed Facebook and Google in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying that it's ""only a matter of time before the global dominance of the US IT monopolies is broken,"" according to a transcript obtained by CNBC.
 Soros said the tech companies were a ""menace"" and ""ever more powerful monopolies,"" that would be tempted to ""compromise themselves"" to enter the Chinese market, where they have long been banned. 
""[A]s Facebook and Google have grown into ever more powerful monopolies, they have become obstacles to innovation, and they have caused a variety of problems of which we are only now beginning to become aware,"" he said, according to the transcript.
 ""They claim they are merely distributing information. But the fact that they are near-monopoly distributors makes them public utilities and should subject them to more stringent regulations, aimed at preserving competition, innovation, and fair and open universal access,"" he said.
Buzzfeed first reported the news.
The temptation to among these companies to cooperate with authoritarian regimes like China in order to get access to those markets ""may well result in a web of totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined."" 
""Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered,"" he said.
Facebook in particular has come under fire from both big names and former employees as it has struggled to dampen hate speech and foreign influence on its platform.
Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also criticized Facebook at the annual meeting of global elites, where he called for Facebook to be regulated like tobacco companies. 
Soros separately at Davos had strong words for President Donald Trump, saying he has set the U.S. ""on a course towards nuclear war.""

 Biggest crypto hack ever loses more than $500M   
 5:59  PM ET Fri, 26 Jan 2018 |  03:35 
 Hackers stole several hundred million dollars' worth of a lesser-known cryptocurrency from a major Japanese exchange Friday. 
 Coincheck said that around 523 million of the exchange's NEM coins were sent to another account around 3 a.m. local time (1 p.m. ET Thursday), according to a Google translation of a Japanese transcript of the Friday press conference from Logmi. The exchange has about 6 percent of yen-bitcoin trading, ranking fourth by market share on CryptoCompare.
The stolen NEM coins were worth about 58 billion yen at the time of detection, or roughly $534.8 million, according to the exchange. Coincheck subsequently restricted withdrawals of all currencies, including yen, and trading of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. 
 Bloomberg first reported the hack. A CNBC email sent to Coincheck's listed address bounced back.
Cryptocurrency NEM, which intends to help businesses handle data digitally, briefly fell more than 20 percent Friday before recovering to trade about 10 percent lower near 85 cents, according to CoinMarketCap. Most other major digital currencies, including bitcoin, traded little changed on the day.
Coincheck management said in the press conference that it held the NEM coins in a ""hot"" wallet, referring to a method of storage that is linked to the internet. In contrast, leading U.S. exchange Coinbase says on its website that 98 percent of its digital currency holdings are offline, or in ""cold"" storage.
The Japanese exchange said it did not appear that hackers had stolen other digital currencies. 
The Coincheck hack follows news in December that a South Korean cryptocurrency exchange called Youbit lost 17 percent of its digital assets. Its parent Yapian filed for bankruptcy.
In another high-profile case, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 and said it lost 750,000 of its users' bitcoins and 100,000 of the exchange's own. The company was the largest bitcoin exchange at the time.
Morgan Stanley analysts estimated in mid-December that more than $630 million in bitcoin has been lost to hackers.

 A recent Google Home blunder highlights one of the search giant's next big challenges with its smart speaker device.
 Anger broke out on social media Thursday afternoon when people started creating videos that showed that Google's smart speaker, Home, couldn't answer the question ""Who is Jesus?"" but could provide responses for Buddha, Muhammad, and Satan.
People hypothesized that it was ""political correctness"" or a lack of respect that kept the device from talking about Jesus or God. 
 Then Google issued a statement on Friday explaining the problem and barring Home from answering questions about other religious figures, too. 
Home pulls some of its answers directly from the web and certain topics (like religion) ""can be more vulnerable to vandalism and spam,"" the company explained via tweet. 
 Tweet
 (If you ask Home who Jesus Christ or Satan is now, it will respond, ""Religion can be complicated and I'm still learning."")
What's going on here? The problem lies with Google's so-called ""featured snippets."" Whether or not you have a smart speaker, you've likely seen this product in action: Ask a question and Google will often serve up a box at the top of search highlighting what its algorithms have determined to be the best answer. 
 This answer isn't always right, however. 
Featured snippets have turned up a host of highly publicized errors over the years, but the problem is much more pernicious when an objectionable answer comes via voice, where it's harder to understand the source that Google's pulling from. 
 Tweet
 Tweet
 Tweet
 If you're only going to get one answer, and not a list of links, that answer better be right. 
Interestingly, Danny Sullivan, who first highlighted Google's big issue with featured snippets, now works at the company to help educate people on how search works and look into issues like these.
This underscores one of Google's big challenges moving forward: Figuring out how to mitigate bad answers. 
As the company pushes Home's AI and ability to pull from Google's resources as one of its greatest strengths against Amazon's competitor, Alexa, the company isn't likely to stop Home from pulling answers from featured snippets altogether. And after all, the beauty of smart speakers is that they give you a quick reply so you don't have to get on a phone or a computer to answer a question. Google just needs to get better at vetting its sources and continuing to stop bad actors from messing with results. 
To be fair, Google answers questions fairly and correctly far, far more often than it gets things wrong. But the stakes are high, especially when children are increasingly using these devices.

According to personal finance website DQYDJ, an initial $1,000 investment in those companies in 2008 would be worth $16,239 and $8,587, respectively, as of January 16.
 If you invested $1,000 in Google in the same time frame, it would have paid off, too. According to DQYDJ, GOOGL would be worth $3,660 as of January 16 and GOOG would be worth $2,008. (Google's stock split into two classes in 2014: GOOGL: Alphabet Class A and GOOG: Alphabet Class C.)
Still, the data shows that one company significantly outperformed Amazon, Apple and either class of Alphabet: Netflix. As of January 16, a $1,000 investment in the video-streaming service would be worth a whopping $70,263.
 Netflix first launched its streaming service in 2007, began producing original content in 2013 and has grown its subscriber base to nearly 120 million accounts worldwide. 
The company also added more than eight million subscribers in the fourth quarter, CNBC reports, significantly more than Wall Street expectations, and its shares have jumped more than 8 percent, bringing its market capitalization above $100 billion for the first time.

 The company plans to spend $7.5-8 billion on content in 2018, including shows from titan Shonda Rhimes and comic book company Millarworld. ""We believe our big investments in content are paying off,"" the company wrote in a letter to shareholders.
But while Netflix's stock has performed well and the company has high hopes for the future, any individual stock can over- or under-perform. Past returns do not predict future results.
Plus, there are some challenges on the horizon. Competitors, such as Disney, which has agreed to buy 21st Century Fox assets, could potentially pull viewers from Netflix with plans to launch their own streaming services.

 Disney's deal with Fox would give the combined company a stake in Netflix's rival, Hulu. In addition, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and YouTube have added more content to their respective platforms.
So some investors are bearish. Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" though, isn't one of them. With Netflix raising the monthly cost for its streaming service and adding more original content to complement already popular shows like ""The Crown"" and ""Stranger Things,"" Cramer, in October, said the company could accelerate its growth even further.
Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, said he doesn't want to get ""too distracted by the competitive landscape."" The company agrees. ""The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many services,"" it notes. ""Entertainment services are often complementary, given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.""
If you're considering getting into the stock market, experts advise beginning carefully.
Experienced investors Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins suggest you start with index funds, which offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills, and fluctuate with the market to eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.

 DQYDJ's stock return calculator tool, which gathers its numbers from data-platform Quandl, properly accounts for stock splits and special dividends by creating a ""data structure [that] contains the initial purchase and the price fluctuations using stock closing prices on each day,"" according to the site. ""Normal splits and dividend events cause us to increase the modeled number of shares held. Reverse splits will reduce the number of shares held.""
The results are cached for up to one week so as not to overwhelm the data provider. The calculator does not account stock spinoffs. And while it does have a reinvestment tool, Netflix's closing number, above, does not account for reinvestments.
""Returns calculated are idealized and will not match the exact returns you realized if you invested over these time-frames,"" the site adds. ""We are not modeling taxes, management fees, dividend payment timing, slippage or other sources of error.""

Nadiem Makarim, chief executive officer of Go-Jek.
 Google has made an investment in Indonesian ride-hailing start-up Go-Jek.
 The move is part of Google's ambition to grow Indonesia's digital economy and start-up scene, the tech giant said in a  statement Monday.
""Go-Jek is led by a strong Indonesian management team and has a proven track record of using technology to make life more convenient for Indonesians across the country,"" said Caesar Sengupta, vice-president of at Google's next billion users initiative, which is the company's plan to target its ""next billion"" users around the world.
 ""This investment lets us partner with a great local champion in Indonesia's flourishing startup ecosystem, while also deepening our commitment to Indonesia's internet economy.""
Google did not disclose the amount invested in Go-Jek.
Reports of the internet titan pouring cash into the firm first surfaced earlier this month.  Reuters and  TechCrunch reported that the investment was part of a $1.2 billion fundraising for the company, with participation from Singapore's sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings and Chinese internet firm Meituan-Dianping.
Last month, Go-Jek acquired three financial technology (fintech) start-ups for undisclosed amounts in a bid to dominate Indonesia's digital payments industry.

A Google Fiber technician installs a fiber optic box at a residential home as part of Google Fiber services in Provo, Utah. Google Fiber is now be headed to Dallas.
 Webpass, the wireless home broadband company that Google Fiber acquired in 2016, is exiting the Boston market. The Verge received a reader tip on the situation and a quick look around revealed that Boston is no longer listed as a current Webpass market on the company's website. (It still  appeared as recently as December.)
Reached by phone Tuesday evening, a Webpass customer service representative confirmed that the company has stopped accepting new customers in Boston. And in a statement, Access — the Alphabet subsidiary that runs Google Fiber — also confirmed the news.
""As with any acquisition, we've spent some time evaluating the Webpass business. As a result of our analysis, we've made the decision to wind down Webpass operations in Boston,"" an Access spokesperson said by email.

""We'll work with customers and partners to minimize disruption, and there will be no immediate impacts to their Webpass service. We continue to see strong subscriber response across the rest of the Webpass portfolio, including successful launches in Denver and Seattle in 2017.""
Before this move, Boston was one of 8 cities served by Webpass, which delivers up-to-gigabit internet speeds for residential and commercial buildings by using point to point wireless. That number has dropped to 7, and old Google search results for Webpass service in Massachusetts now redirect to the main homepage.
 Webpass internet service is available exclusively in apartment units and condo buildings. It originally came to Boston in 2015 and the company has (or at least had) an office in the city.  Per The Boston Globe, Comcast and RCN already offer gigabit-class broadband in Boston. At least on Yelp, Webpass internet was well-reviewedamong Boston residents.  Webpass last expanded its service a year ago to cover Denver.
Google Fiber announced its acquisition of Webpass  in June 2016 amid reports that executives at Alphabet (including Larry Page) had  demanded a scaling back of Fiber's costly rollout ambitions. Layoffs and executive departures followed, and a few months later in October, Google Fiber announced it would pause deployment efforts in nine cities. The company also recently  cancelled hundreds of installations in Kansas City, its original launch market.
The wireless approach that Webpass uses is less expensive than laying fiber optic cable in the ground and doesn't come with the same local approval hurdles and slow progress that Google Fiber faced back when it seemed like Google was serious about taking on Comcast and other broadband providers.
But you need only look at Google Fiber's service map for a dose of reality and an idea of how those dreams have stalled over the last few years. At present, there are zero ""upcoming Fiber city"" locations listed on Google Fiber's map — only ""potential"" areas of future service. Google Fiber hasn't yet updated the map to remove Boston as a Webpass city. Chicago, Denver, Miami, Oakland / East Bay, San Diego, San Francisco, and Seattle are the remaining Webpass service areas.

Diane Greene, Google
 MobileIron, a provider of mobile security for businesses, jumped as much as 14 percent on Tuesday after announcing a partnership with Google that will allow companies to securely purchase and manage enterprise apps for employees.
 The stock climbed as high as $4.60 and was trading up 5.2 percent to $4.26 as of Tuesday afternoon. 
Google and MobileIron are launching a cloud services store that will help app developers with branding, billing, secure cloud access and analytics.  A MobileIron spokesperson told CNBC that the store will likely launch in the second half of 2018, and will initially target phone companies like AT&T and Deutsche Telecom, which sell cloud services to their customers.
 The partnership builds on Google's acquisition of Orbitera, a platform for cloud marketplaces, in late 2016. 
The new store could make Google's cloud offerings more competitive with Amazon Web Services, which introduced a cloud software store in 2012. Google's cloud business, run by CEO Diane Greene, is currently a distant third behind Amazon and Microsoft Azure. 
MobileIron, which has a market value of below $500 million, is flat over the past year, while shares of Google parent Alphabet have jumped 44 percent.

 });Source: Nuru
 A new startup that proposes a different spin on autonomous transportation came out of stealth today. The company, called Nuro, was founded by two former lead Google engineers who worked on the famed self-driving car project. Unlike the plethora of self-driving startups out there, Nuro isn't focused on reconfiguring robot taxis or autonomous trucks, but on designing a new type of vehicle altogether.
Nuro is focused on deliveries, specifically the kind that are low-speed, local, and last-mile: groceries, laundry, or your take-out order from Seamless. The startup thinks that automating these services could help shoulder the sharp increase in last-mile deliveries, while also reducing traffic accidents and boosting local businesses who are looking for ways to thrive and compete in the age of Amazon.
 Low speed, local, and last-mile
 And their timing couldn't be better. The converging trends of robotics, self-driving cars, and e-commerce are leading to an explosion of interest in the last-mile delivery challenge. Consumers are ordering more items online than ever before, and there is a growing expectation for shorter and shorter delivery windows. A recent study by McKinsey put the global price tag of last-mile delivery every year at around $86 billion, with staggering year-over-year growth rates.
 While it works out the kinks in its drone delivery project, Amazon is also considering using self-driving robots, having just filed a patent for an autonomous ground vehicle. Toyota unveiled its bizarre ""e-palette"" concept at CES this year. Meanwhile, Starship Technologies has sidewalk-only delivery robots making trips in California, Washington, DC, Germany, and the UK. Last year, Ford Motor Company teamed up with Domino's to deliver pizza via a self-driving car. And later today, a Northern Californian startup called Udelv is demonstratingwhat it calls ""the world's first public-road autonomous delivery test,"" in which a self-driving van (with human safety driver) will deliver goods from the high-end Draeger's Market chain in the Bay Area city of San Mateo.
Nuro is taking a different approach. Rather than dress up a Lexus crossover or a Ford Focus in self-driving hardware and throw some grocery sacks inside, their engineers have built something entirely new from the ground up. At first glance, Nuro's R1 prototype (just an internal nickname and not the official name) looks like a giant lunchbox on wheels, or maybe even a mobile toaster. If anything, Nuro's first vehicle looks more like the original ""Firefly"" prototypes that Google officially retired last summer than anything you'd see on the road today.
 A giant lunchbox on wheels
 But a closer inspection reveals that the ""handle"" on the roof is actually a platform for the vehicle's sensor array, which includes LIDAR, cameras, and radars. And a peek through the windshield will also reveal the complete absence of traditional controls like steering wheels, foot pedals, and gear shifts. There's no driver seat because humans were not meant to operate this vehicle.
That said, Nuro is designing its vehicles for remote operation, placing it alongside startups such as Phantom Auto and others that are working on remotely operated driverless vehicles. But real-time teleoperation has its challenges, such as signal latency and other issues. To gain enough confidence for public deployment, Nuro is using a fleet of six self-driving cars to collect data and optimize routes, which then gets fed into its prototype vehicles. Nuro has received a permit from the California DMV and plans to start testing on public roads later this year. But the company will need sign-off from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration before it can operate in states where regulation prohibits completely human-free driving.
""We've built the full software stack from scratch. There are a lot of components that are shared with general self-driving, and some things that are a bit different,"" said Dave Ferguson who, along with Jiajun Zhu, co-founded Nuro. ""We've been able to architecture this thing from scratch, geared toward this passenger-less, goods-only transportation.""
Read more from The Verge:These six-wheeled robots are about to start delivering food in the USWaymo retires its cute self-driving car in favor of minivansPlastic pollution is making corals sick
Ferguson said they considered building the R1 to drive on sidewalks but ultimately decided to make it road-worthy instead. The vehicle is about as tall as a Toyota Highlander but only about half the width, which Ferguson said is one of its standout features. This skinniness translates into a 3 to 4-foot ""buffer"" around the R1 so other vehicles and pedestrians can maneuver safely around it.
""Even if you have the perfect self-driving vehicle, if someone pops out between two parked cars and it's within your stopping distance, you can't prevent that accident,"" he said. ""Whereas if you have a vehicle that's half the width, and you've got an extra three or four feet of clearance, you can avoid it... and you have room to maneuver around them. You can better design the vehicle to mitigate the severity of any accident.""
There are some challenges to Nuro's business model, specifically how customers will receive their deliveries from the self-driving delivery pod. No driver means no one to ring your doorbell or trudge up four flights of stairs to hand over your pad thai. Ferguson says he envisions customers using — what else? — an app to inform them when the vehicle has arrived in front of their building or in their driveway. They would then be given a code that pops open the vehicle's side hatches so they can retrieve their items. They are also considering using facial recognition technology. But what's to prevent people from stealing someone else's deliveries? There are still a lot of details that need to be worked out, Ferguson acknowledged.
 No driver means no one to ring your doorbell 
 Ferguson and Zhu are two guys who know more than a little about autonomous driving. Zhu was one of the founding engineers of Google's self-driving team, while Ferguson was a leading software engineer on the team. Both left Google at the same time as its chief technology officer Chris Urmson, who has since gone on to start his own self-driving company, Aurora.
Aside from a brief internship at Intel, Zhu had spent much of his career at Google and was the self-driving team's principal software engineer from 2008-2016. Ferguson came to Google in 2011 after a stint at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute, which has been at the forefront of the autonomous driving revolution. He served as the principal computer-vision and machine-learning engineer at Google before leaving with Zhu in late 2016 to start Nuro. Since then, they've attracted talent from the likes of Google, Apple, Tesla, Waymo, and GM to build out their team.
Nuro has already raised $92 million in two rounds of fundraising and is in talks with a number of retailers and delivery providers about possible partnerships. A likelier outcome is Nuro gets quickly bought up by a company like Amazon. The race to develop self-driving technology has sparked a furious round of mergers and acquisitions over the past few years, the rate of which has yet to subside.
Ferguson said that he hopes Nuro's fresh approach to self-driving — focusing on delivering goods rather than people — hopefully means that Nuro will stand out from the pack.
""Almost all of the big players in self-driving passenger transportation are really, really focused on that application because for many of them it's an existential threat,"" Ferguson said. ""And most of them feel that goods transportation is going to be a follow-on application. For us, we felt, in and of its own right, it was an important enough problem and one that we could make real headway on earlier than passenger transportation.""
He added, ""That makes us sound smarter or more cunning than we are ... It makes sense for them to be focused on that, but it also leaves open a pretty big opportunity to go after this other area.""

Apple CEO Tim Cook.
 We've seen some spectacular advances in fields ranging from surgery to gene editing, but health care still faces a lackluster problem: Many patients can only get health records from their doctor if the fax machine is working.
 Even when records are stored electronically, different chunks of every patient's health information sit in inaccessible electronic record systems in different doctors' offices.
Anyone who needs their medical files gets them either printed or faxed or has to log on into separate portals for each doctor and hospital, and even then getting view-only access. That's a huge pain. View-only apps can't access data to help patients share information with family and health-care providers, make decisions, monitor disease, stay on course with medications, or just stay healthy. 
 I believe every patient deserves a bank account of sorts for their health data, under their control, with deposits made after every health encounter. After my colleagues and I demonstrated an open, free version of this bank account idea to companies in 2006, Google and Microsoft launched similar personally controlled health records, known as GoogleHealth and Microsoft HealthVault. Walmart and other employers offered our version, called Indivo, as an employee benefit.
Unfortunately, even these industry giants couldn't shake loose data from the computer systems in doctors' offices or make the case to patients that curating the data was worth the effort.
But more than a decade later, things are finally changing.
Using Apple's iPhone Health app, patients will soon be able to download and view health records on their phones.
Apple's product enters the health sector under different circumstances.
Today, a lot more patient data is electronic after a $48 billion federal investment in promoting the adoption of information technology to providers, initiated under legislation called the HITECH Act. But those products, mostly older software and purchased at enormous expense, still don't promote record sharing with doctors or patients.
Recognizing this unacceptable limitation and having received a generous grant for a tiny fraction of that federal investment, our team created a program called SMART. SMART is an interface to make doctors' electronic health records work like iPhones do. Apps can be added or deleted easily. The major electronic health record brands have all built this interface into their products.
Apple uses SMART to connect the health app to hospitals and doctors' offices. The good news for patients, doctors and innovators is that Apple chose a standardized, open connection over a proprietary, closed one. This approach lets any other app, whether running on the web, iPhone, or Android, use that same interface to connect.
So Apple will compete on value and customer satisfaction, rather than on an exclusive lock on the data.
 Understanding the nuances
 Apple's approach could help Americans trying to stay well or manage their conditions. But only with follow-through by Apple, health systems, technology companies, patient groups, policymakers and government regulators. The emerging ecosystem's nuances must be appreciated.
First of all, the floodgates for patient information are at least a crack open and will be hard to close. As patients gain access to their data, they will recognize it is incomplete and feel frustrated it's not available everywhere. But, patients in need will drive demand for data access in their role as health consumers.
Secondly, the government is using law and regulations to compel an open interface. By selecting SMART on FHIR, a framework for exchanging health-care information electronically, Apple and its health-care launch partners mark the importance of standardization. A uniform approach is critical for scale. Imagine if every electrical product required a differently shaped 120V outlet.
Understanding this, Google, Quest Diagnostics, Eli Lily, Optum and many other companies are using the same interface to plug into health care.
Thirdly, while Apple is bringing health records to the phone, that data will still be ""view only.""
In 2009, I had the chance to meet with Apple vice president Bud Tribble to talk about how the iPhone could serve health care. We concluded that crucial data — like the medication list — had to be as easy for iOS developers to use in their apps as contacts and location are now. I would not be surprised if this were the next step in Apple's journey — making the health records available to iPhone app developers. Here, too, is an opportunity to chose open interfaces and to allow patients to export the data to another device.
Finally, competition in health care IT is hot.
Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook all have health-care divisions. Apple's hardware, including sensors in the phone and watch, will monitor patients at home. Google's artificial intelligence will lead doctors and patients to diagnoses and decisions. Amazon is reported to be looking atpharmacy management. Facebook has sifted through posts to detect and possibly intervene when users may be suicidal.
There are so many opportunities to compete. But locking up a patient's data should never be one of them.

Jim Whitehurst, CEO of Red Hat
 Red Hat has acquired CoreOS for $250 million, in a deal that brings further momentum to a Google-created technology used by companies to manage software running in data centers and in the cloud.
 The move gives Red Hat a prominent name to keep commercializing hot open-source software as part of its arsenal. Red Hat's core business is taking open-source products, such as the Linux operating system, which are collectively created by a large public community rather than by any one company, and selling services around them such as support and customization.
CoreOS is often mentioned in the same breath as Docker. Both San Francisco start-ups offer technologies for ""containerization,"" which became popular around 2014 as a way of helping corporate software run more efficiently in ""hybrid"" cloud scenarios, where the software runs both on local data centers and in clouds such as those provided by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. CoreOS, the company, was built to commercialize an open-source product by the same name. Container technology is a key part of a Google-developed open-source technology called Kubernetes. Docker was later to adopt support for Kubernetes.
 ""By combining CoreOS's complementary capabilities with Red Hat's already broad Kubernetes and container-based portfolio, including Red Hat OpenShift, Red Hat aims to further accelerate adoption and development of the industry's leading hybrid cloud platform for modern application workloads,"" the company said in a statement.
CoreOS has 130 employees, who are joining Red Hat, and has raised $50 million, according to CrunchBase, the bulk of it from Alphabet's venture arm GV, formerly known as Google Ventures.
Docker, meanwhile, has raised more than $240 million from a variety of well-known venture firms, including Greylock and Sequoia.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, left, and Google CEO Larry Page
 To make any real progress in advancing data privacy this year, we have to start doing something about Google and Facebook. Not doing so would be like trying to lose weight without changing your diet. Simply ineffective.
 The impact these two companies have on our privacy cannot be understated. You may know that hidden trackers lurk on most websites you visit, soaking up your personal information.
What you may not realize, though, is 76 percent of websites now contain hidden Google trackers, and 24 percent have hidden Facebook trackers, according to the Princeton Web Transparency & Accountability Project. The next highest is Twitter with 12 percent. It is likely that Google or Facebook are watching you on many sites you visit, in addition to tracking you when using their products.
 As a result, these two companies have amassed huge data profiles on each person, which can include your interests, purchases, search, browsing and location history, and much more. They then make your sensitive data profile available for invasive targeted advertising that can follow you around the Internet.
This advertising system is designed to enable hyper-targeting, which has many unintended consequences, such as the ability for bad actors to use the system to influence the most susceptible or to exclude groups in a way that facilitates discrimination.
 ""These two companies have amassed huge data profiles on each person, which can include your interests, purchases, search, browsing and location history, and much more.""
 Because of their entrenched positions in a wide array of Internet services, each collecting personal information that together combine into these massive digital profiles, Google and Facebook can offer hyper-targeting much better than the competition.
As a result, they now  make up 63 percent of all digital advertising, and accounted for 74 percent of this market's growth in 2017, according to eMarketer. Together they form a tight digital advertising duopoly, showing no signs of abating.
Google and Facebook also use your data as input for increasingly sophisticated AI algorithms that put you in a filter bubble — an alternate digital universe that controls what you see in their products, based on what their algorithms think you are most likely to click on.
These echo chambers distort people's reality, creating a myriad of unintended consequences such as increasing societal polarization. On their unending march to profit from more and more personal information, Google and Facebook have shown little regard for all the negative consequences of their runaway algorithms.
So how do we move forward from here?
Don't be fooled by claims of self-regulation, as any useful long-term reforms of Google and Facebook's data privacy practices fundamentally oppose their core business models: hyper-targeted advertising based on more and more intrusive personal surveillance. Change must come from the outside.
Unfortunately, we've seen relatively little from Washington. Congress and federal agencies need to take a fresh look at what can be done to curb these data monopolies. They first need to demand more algorithmic and privacy policy transparency, so people can truly understand the extent of how their personal information is being collected, processed and used by these companies. Only then can informed consent be possible.
They also need to legislate that people own their own data, enabling real opt-outs. Finally, they need to restrict how data can be combined including being more aggressive at blocking acquisitions that further consolidate data power, which will pave the way for more competition in digital advertising.
Until we see such meaningful changes, consumers should vote with their feet. DuckDuckGo found that about a quarter of American adults are already taking significant actions to take back their privacy. Helping in this effort are seamless browser add-ons that will block Google and Facebook's hidden trackers across the Internet, as well as more private alternatives to their core services. I can say from my own experience, you can indeed live Google and Facebook free.
If we do nothing about Google and Facebook, we will get more of the same: more hyper-targeting, more algorithmic bias, less competition and the further erosion of collateral industries, like media. Enough is enough.
The complete loss of personal privacy in the Internet age is not inevitable. Through thoughtful regulation and increased consumer choice, we can choose a brighter path. I hope to look back at 2018 as a turning point in data privacy, where we awoke to the unacceptable implications of two companies controlling so much of our digital future.

Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince and Defense Minister Mohammed bin Salman (2nd L) takes his seat to meet with U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis and his delegation on April 19, 2017 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
 Saudi Aramco, the world's largest energy company, and Google parent Alphabet have entered discussions to create a technology hub in Saudi Arabia, the Wall Street Journal reports.
 The kingdom is embarking upon an ambitious plan, led by the 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to diversify the nation's oil-dependent economy. The foundation of the effort is a plan to create a huge sovereign wealth fund, underwritten by selling shares in the state-owned Aramco.
The initial public offering, which could happen this year, is expected to be the world's biggest-ever share sale. Aramco President and CEO Amin Nasser recently told CNBC his company is ready for the IPO this year, but is waiting on the government to choose an international list venue.
 Alphabet and Aramco have discussed forming a joint venture that would build data centers around the kingdom, sources familiar with the matter tell the Journal. It remains to be seen which customers the data centers would serve and how large the joint venture would be, but it could be listed in the Saudi stock exchange, the sources said.
The talks have been ongoing for months and have involved Alphabet CEO Larry Page, the Journal reports.
Amazon, one of the leaders in the cloud computing industry, is also reportedly in the mix. Sources tell the Journal it could soon sign a $1 billion deal to build three data centers in Saudi Arabia, with the deal expected to be announced during Salman's anticipated visit to the United States this year. 
Salman is the driving force behind Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, a plan to overhaul the economy that includes a greater focus on the technology sector. A network of data centers could provide the backbone for a burgeoning tech industry in the kingdom.
The Journal notes that data centers in Europe currently service Saudi Arabia via undersea cables, an arrangement that slows down traffic.
Saudi Aramco is primarily focused on pumping oil and refining it into products like gasoline. It has plans to grow its business producing chemicals and plastics, but those are byproducts of fossil fuels.
An expansion into operating data centers would mark a significant step toward diversification.

 ""AI is one of the most important things humanity is working on. It is more profound than, I dunno, electricity or fire,"" says Pichai, speaking at a town hall event in San Francisco in January.
A number of very notable tech leaders have made bold statements about the potential of artificial intelligence. Tesla boss Elon Musks says AI is more dangerous than North Korea. Famous physicist Stephen Hawking says AI could be the ""worst event in the history of our civilization."" And Y Combinator President Sam Altman likens AI to nuclear fission.
 Even in such company, Pichai's comment seems remarkable. Interviewer and Recode executive editor Kara Swisher stopped Pichai when he made the comment. ""Fire? Fire is pretty good,"" she retorts.

 Pichai sticks by his assertion. ""Well, it kills people, too,"" Pichai says of fire. ""We have learned to harness fire for the benefits of humanity but we had to overcome its downsides too. So my point is, AI is really important, but we have to be concerned about it.""

 Indeed, for many, so much about artificial intelligence is unknown and therefore scary. However, Pichai also points out that ""it is important to help people understand that they use AI today. AI is just making computers more intelligent and being able to do a wide variety of tasks and we take it for granted whenever something happens and we adopt it,"" he says.
""So for example, today, Google can translate across many many languages and people use it billions of times a day. That's because of AI.
""Or if you ... go to Google and search for images of sunset, or if you go to Google photos and search for images of people hugging, we can actually pull together and show pictures of people hugging.

""AI holds the potential for some of the biggest advances we are going to see. You know whenever I see the news of a young person dying of cancer, you realize AI is going to play a role in solving that in the future, so I think we owe it to make progress,"" the Google CEO says.
That being said, it is still important to think about humanity's future with artificial intelligence, Pichai says. ""It is right to be concerned, absolutely, you have to worry about it otherwise you are not going to solve it.""

 For its part, Google has committed to donating $1 billion to job-retraining over the next five years to help a transitioning workforce. But according to YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, it can't be the sole responsibility of the private sector — companies and the government are going to need to work together, she says.
Caution and strategic retraining are necessary because there is no way to stem the tsunami of technological innovation once, nor should there be, both Wojcicki and Pichai point out.
""We have to recognize where we do live, in this time where there is really dramatic change from a technology standpoint and the innovations that we have, but that doesn't mean those innovations are going to stop,"" says Wojcicki. ""Technology is going to continue, it is going to continue to move forward. You need to move forward with that technology responsibly.""
For current and future generations of workers, continual learning will have to become the norm.
""We know that 20 to 30 years ago, you educated yourself and that carried you through for the rest of your life. That is not going to be true for the generation which is being born now. They have to learn continuously over their lives. We know that. So we have to transform how we do education,"" says Pichai.
AI is forcing change upon companies, workers and society's infrastructure. ""It is important to understand that tomorrow, whether Google is there or not, artificial intelligence is going to progress. Technology has this nature. It is going to evolve,"" says Pichai.

Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud
 Reports surfaced Thursday that Saudi Aramco, the world's largest energy company, and Google parent Alphabet have reportedly  entered discussions to create a technology hub in Saudi Arabia.
 This news is the latest and perhaps the most solid evidence that Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman is not only the most powerful man in Saudi Arabia, and not only the most powerful leader in Sunni Islam, he is now clearly the most powerful man in the entire Middle East.
That's because he's not only gained more control over his own country but doing so has made Saudi Arabia more powerful both politically and financially.
 It's been just seven months since his  reportedly ailing father King Salman effectively handed control of the country to him by naming him crown prince. Since then, the 32-year-old bin Salman has run full speed with his three-part plan to strengthen the country. Part one was shoring up Saudi defenses against Iran, which he accomplished in many ways but most notably by entering into a more solid partnership with Israel.
Step two was a major series of cultural reforms that included  purging anti-American and anti-Jewish clerics and granting more rights for women.
 ""Crown Prince bin Salman is being rewarded for his actions. The U.S. is rewarding him. Israel is rewarding him. Now, two of the richest corporations in the world are poised to do the same.""
 Step three was more controversial. That was the crown prince's plan to improve the nation's finances and send an anti-corruption message by detaining without trial about 200 of his fellow princes and government officials at the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton.
That group included the richest man in the Middle East, his cousin and fellow prince, Alwaleed bin Talal. But the operation has come to an apparently peaceful and lucrative end with many billions of dollars turned over to the government by the detainees in return for their release.
All of this has happened with no apparent protest and no reported violent outbursts. Compare that with the  massive protests that engulfed Iran just a few weeks ago.
Now, the Alphabet/Google talks with the Saudis, as well as a separate deal for three data centers with Amazon, are taking the crown prince's successes to a new level. It's the first proof that his efforts to diversify his nation's economy from being solely dependent on oil aren't such a long shot after all.
Of course, these talks with America's tech titans would not have been possible without all the major moves bin Salman made first. Improving the nation's security, finances, rights for women, and toning down its worst Islamist rhetoric go a long way to making the kingdom a more attractive place to invest.
But look at the bigger picture. Sure, Saudi Arabia still doesn't have the strongest military, and it still doesn't have a very large population. It's also still backing the government in Yemen against an Iranian-sponsored revolt. None of that has stopped Saudi Arabia from continuing to have the biggest GDP in the Middle East, the most allies in the region and the power of rising oil prices to boot.
So, finally, we understand the purpose of all the crown prince's sweeping moves since June. They're not just about stepping up militarily to deter Iran's ambitions in the region. Now we know it's about finding a way to make an impressive form of foreign investment in Saudi Arabia more possible.
There are other Middle Eastern leaders with autocratic power who would like to do the same thing. But they don't have the money, the powerful friends,  or true support from their own populations that bin Salman clearly has.
Imagine if the mullahs in Iran used their power to achieve these kinds of goals instead of being  the world's top sponsor of terrorism, launching proxy wars all over the region, and granting fewer rights to their own people. Imagine if the leaders of Syria and Egypt did something like this 40 or 50 years ago instead of obsessing and warring with Israel.
Saudi Arabia was just about as guilty as its peers of being similarly misdirected in favor of Wahhabist Islamism and other counterproductive nonsense for decades. But now it has a leader who has a better and clearer focus.
Yes, that detention of his peers at the Riyadh Ritz was disturbing in many ways. But it's hard to make a lack of due process a deal breaker in the neighborhood where we see Iran's brutal domestic repression or a  Syrian civil war that's claimed almost half a million lives.
Crown Prince bin Salman is being rewarded for his actions. The U.S. is rewarding him. Israel is rewarding him. Now, two of the richest corporations in the world are poised to do the same.
And all that will do is make him even more powerful. Hopefully, this kind of positive reinforcement will encourage other leaders in the Middle East to follow his lead.

Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene.
 Alphabet on Thursday disclosed the revenues of its Google cloud business for the first time on Thursday. 
 The cloud is ""already a billion-dollar-per-quarter business,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on a conference call with analysts to go over results from the fourth quarter.
The metric represents the size of Google's portfolio of cloud-based productivity apps, known as G Suite, as well as the Google Cloud Platform. Even with the new disclosure, it's still not clear how much of the quarterly cloud revenue is coming from G Suite.
 Google Cloud Platform is thought to be No. 3 in the public cloud market, behind Amazon Web Services, which had more than $5 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter. Google's public cloud is also behind Microsoft's Azure public cloud.
Amazon Web Services does have productivity tools, but they're not as widely used as services like Google Docs, Google Sheets and Gmail, which are part of G Suite. That means making direct comparisons between AWS and the Google cloud isn't perfectly fair.
Microsoft doesn't provide exact numbers for Azure, but on Wednesday Microsoft said its ""commercial cloud"" lineup, which includes the Office 365 productivity suite, the Dynamics 365 software, and Azure, produced $5.3 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, up 56 percent year over year. Azure itself saw revenue growth of 98 percent. 
AWS revenue, for the sake of comparison, grew 44.6 percent year over year.
Here's what Pichai said on Thursday's earnings call: 
 Google Cloud, which includes Google Cloud Platform and G Suite, has reached meaningful scale, and I'm excited to share today that it's already a billion dollar per quarter business. In fact, we believe that Google Cloud Platform, based on publicly reported data for the twelve months ended December 2017, is the fastest growing major public cloud provider in the world. We are also increasingly doing larger, more strategic deals with customers. In fact, the number of deals worth over $1 million across all Cloud products more than tripled from 2016 to 2017. 
The G Suite now has 4 million paying customers, Pichai said.
Google first introduced the Google Compute Engine cloud-computing service in 2012. Amazon introduced AWS in 2006, and Microsoft launched its first Azure service in 2008.

 Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene told CNBC that Alphabet disclosed the financial contributions of two key cloud businesses to counter ""misinformation"" about how much money they were actually bringing in.
 During Alphabet's Thursday call with analysts to discuss results from the fourth quarter, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the Google Cloud Platform and the G Suite portfolio of productivity apps, combined, now represent a ""billion-dollar-per-quarter business."" It was the first time Google has ever announced revenue for its cloud or enterprise businesses.
The announcement comes as Alphabet seeks to catch up to market leader Amazon Web Services and second-place public cloud Microsoft Azure, while also boosting the G Suite to take share from Microsoft's Office business.
 Pichai made the statement less than an hour after Amazon reported that Amazon Web Services brought in more than $5 billion in the quarter. Meanwhile, one day earlier Microsoft had said its commercial cloud business, including the Azure public cloud, had revenue exceeding $5 billion during the quarter.
Greene said the timing of Google's cloud money announcement was coincidental.
""We just wanted to get it out because there was a lot of misinformation about our traction, and people sort of grossly underestimating it, and so we just thought we should make it clear how successful we are and how well we're doing, because it gives people confidence in the enterprise, it matters, and we're proud of it,"" Greene told CNBC in an interview.
Greene declined to talk about how much of the cloud revenue figure is coming from G Suite. 
""In the Cloud Platform and services, when people sign up to do it, there's generally a lag between when they sign up and when they have everything there and running and they're paying for their usage -- and so I think this announcement portends good things,"" Greene said.
Greene, an Alphabet board member, joined Google to lead its cloud businesses in November 2015. 
""We've kind of reached a point in Q4 where we're not hitting deal blockers at all,"" Greene said. ""We have people like PayPal in production -- a heavily regulated company. We have HSBC in production. That's a milestone for us. We can serve absolutely any company and do everything they need. And now our considerable differentiation is starting to shine through.""
Greene pointed to machine learning and data analytics as points of differentiation, and she also talked up the use of open source software like Kubernetes and TensorFlow, which can be used beyond Google's cloud, as a strength.
""We have the most open, fully complete solution for running in multiple on-premises and cloud, and even other cloud environments,"" Greene said.
The Kubernetes container orchestration software, which Google made available under an open-source license in 2014, is ""the leading way to do this stuff now and that's remarkably quick for something like that."" This speaks to her core expertise: Greene was a founder and CEO at VMware, which sells software for managing applications running in virtual machines, a sort of predecessor to containers.

 Sequoia, a top U.S. venture capital firm, is targeting a new fund between $5 billion and $6 billion, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC.
 The talks are in the early stages, one source said, adding that the fund size could be higher or lower than the target.
It would be a globally-focused fund to invest in technology companies. The fund would also be the third global growth fund for the company. The previous two were $700 million in 2012, and $2 billion in 2015. The third fund would likely be higher than this.
 A Sequoia spokesperson declined to comment.
Sequoia is a well-respected venture firm that has been around since the 1970s. It had previously invested in companies including Google and Apple, and more recently in Airbnb and Stripe.
The news comes as private tech companies are staying private for longer and valuations are rising. Instead of choosing the public markets, firms like Uber are opting to take later stage funding.
Meanwhile SoftBank, which recently took a stake in Uber, has come to the market with a $100 billion fund, and getting into many later-stage businesses.

 Cramer to Alphabet: 'Enough of fine' on earnings   
 10:48  AM ET Fri,  2 Feb 2018 |  01:25 
 Alphabet's fourth-quarter earnings were decent, but CNBC's Jim Cramer wants even more from the Google parent.
 ""Enough of 'fine,'"" Cramer said Friday on ""Squawk on the Street"" a day after Alphabet reported disappointing quarterly earnings but strong revenue growth.
""They seem just happy to make it to the playoffs,"" Cramer said. ""Don't you want to try to make it to the Super Bowl? Why are you so content with just getting first round?""
 Alphabet's stock fell as much as 5 percent after hours Thursday after it reported earnings, and shares were down about 4.5 percent on Friday. Investors appeared to be leery of rising costs and reduced margins at the California-based tech company.
Cramer said Alphabet's stock will come back from its fall.
Google's ad business drove the company's growth. Cramer wished that the company could produce numbers as good as Amazon's. The e-commerce giant on Thursday reported strong holiday sales and growth in its ad business.
""What an unfortunate thing to report the same day as Amazon,"" said Cramer, host of CNBC's ""Mad Money."" ""Alphabet is fine, but there is an element that just says, 'enough of fine.' Do you mind blowing away the numbers like everyone else is?""
What ""saves"" Alphabet are the valuations, Cramer argued. ""It's an incredibly cheap stock.""
Alphabet did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Thursday, both Apple and Google reported their quarterly financial performance. And in amid a whole lot of investor speak, there was also a key lesson in leadership:  Take the time to recognize your team for their hard work. 
 Apple CEO Tim Cook thanked his iPhone team.
""I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous amount of work that went into creating iPhone X.

 Tony Robbins: You need these two skills to live a happy life   
 11:20  AM ET Fri,  6 Oct 2017 |  01:14 
 Of course, it is well within these CEOs best interests to brag about their teams as investors are listening, but there is a greater lesson to be had: It's good business to say ""thank you"" to employees. It doesn't cost anything and the return is potentially very large. 
According to a  2013 survey from jobs website Glassdoor, more than half of respondents say they would stay longer at a company if they felt they were more appreciated by their boss. And 81 percent of survey respondents say they are motivated to work harder when their boss shows appreciation for their work, which is more than twice the 38 percent of employees who say they are motivated to work harder when their boss is demanding and 37 percent of employees who report being motivated to work harder because they are worried about losing their job.
PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi takes the value of saying ""thank you"" one step further: She sends thank you notes to the parents of her senior executives. That amounts to more than 400 letters.
It all began when she became the CEO of PepsiCo in 2006. She traveled to India, where she grew up, to see her mother. A slew of guests came through the house congratulating Nooyi's mother on her daughter's promotion.
""When I got home and I sat in the living room, a stream of visitors and random people started to show up,"" Nooyi says on ""The David Rubenstein Show."" ""They'd go to my mom and say, 'You did such a good job with your daughter. Compliments to you. She's CEO.' But not a word to me.""
Nooyi started the practice of thanking the parents of her senior executives. ""I said, 'Thank you for the gift of your child to our company,'"" Nooyi tells Rubenstein.
Nooyi's notes went a long way to establishing herself as a trustworthy leader.
The responses were effusive, like ""My God, this is the best thing that's happened to my parents. And it's the best thing that's happened to me,"" according to Nooyi.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a company event in San Francisco in 2014.
 Microsoft is trying to lure users of cloud services from Box, Dropbox and Alphabet's Google Drive by giving them its competitive product for free.
 On Tuesday, Microsoft said users of those three file sync and sharing services can switch to OneDrive for Business without paying anything until their current contract expires. Microsoft is only running the offer for the next five months, according to a blog post from Ron Markezich, a corporate vice president.
The promotion is further proof of Microsoft's commitment to building its Office 365 lineup of cloud productivity services, including OneDrive for Business. Organizations are only eligible if they're not already OneDrive for Business or Office 365 customers, and if deployments will reach at least 500 users, Markezich wrote.
 Microsoft's offer comes a month after reports that Dropbox has filed confidentially to go public. And last week, Alphabet announced that G Suite, which includes Google Drive, has 4 million paying customers. More than 350,000 organizations currently have OneDrive, Markezich wrote. 
Commercial subscriptions to Office 365 represent a key portion of Microsoft's commercial cloud, which generated $5.3 billion in revenue in the latest quarter, up 56 percent from the prior year. Continuing growth of Office 365 commercial revenue was assumed in a recent prediction by Evercore ISI analysts that Microsoft could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2020.
 It's not the first time Microsoft has given away technology to attract business. In 2016 the company said it would hand out free licenses to its Windows Server operating system for companies that would commit to switching from VMware to Microsoft's Hyper-V server virtualization technology.

Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.
 Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick shed more light on why he wanted to hire Anthony Levandowski, the engineer accused of stealing trade secrets from Waymo, the self-driving car company owned by Google parent Alphabet.
 Kalanick's testimony came as part of the dramatic trade secrets trial between Uber and Waymo that is happening this week in San Francisco.
""I wanted to hire Anthony and he wanted to start a company, so I tried to come up with a situation where he could feel like he started a company and I could feel like I hired him,"" Kalanick said on the stand Tuesday afternoon.
 Through testimony and presentations over last two days, Waymo's lawyers have tried to show how desperate Uber was to catch up to Google's self-driving car efforts and how Kalanick believed that Levandowski could provide a big advantage to closing that gap.
During proceedings on Tuesday, Kalanick admitted that Levandowski met at Uber's office in late 2015, before Levandowski left Waymo to start self-driving truck company Otto. Kalanick confirmed the two of them discussed the possibility of Uber acquiring his company, even though no business existed at that time. Kalanick saying it was either ""late 2015 or early 2016""
Notes from John Bares, Uber's engineering manager, during a meeting with Kalanick suggest Kalanick wanted ""IP"" or intellectual property from the acquisition of Levandowski's company.
 Notes from another meeting between Kalanick and Levandowski from January 3, 2016, show the two discussed lasers for self-driving car technology.
 In its opening arguments on Monday Waymo painted Uber as a competitor that ""needed to win at all costs.""
Waymo spent a significant amount of time on Tuesday questioning Kalanick about prior comments he made saying autonomous driving is an ""existential"" crisis for Uber. Kalanick responded by saying ""If you're running a tech company and you're not making new innovation, you become part of the past.""
Uber however, is arguing that this case is about the fight for top engineering talent. ""Engineers, California and everywhere else in America, are free to go from one job to the other. They don't get a lobotomy in between. They bring all their engineering talent, all the skills they've learned, their education, the publicly known stuff they've worked with, and they can work on the very same technology in the new company,"" Uber's lawyer Bill Carmody said Monday.
Overall, this case hangs on whether or not Waymo can prove that Uber improperly acquired, used, and benefited from any of eight ""trade secrets"" in question.
Uber argued on Monday that these trade secrets are not trade secrets at all, and that Waymo brought this case over fears of losing talent to competitors.
Waymo is seeking damages from Uber and an injunction to shut down its plans to use driverless car technology.

 After weathering a year of scandal and criticism, Alphabet is officially acknowledging that fake news and disturbing YouTube videos can hurt its reputation.
 For the first time, Google's parent company lists ""misleading"" information and ""objectionable content"" from third-parties in the risks section of its annual 10-K filing as issues that could potentially affect its brands. 
2017 was a tough year for many of the major tech companies, which got slammed for allowing Russian election meddling, spreading hateful content and creating addictive products. Alphabet's new disclosure indicates that the company expects the increased scrutiny to continue into 2018. 
 Alphabet made over 86% of total revenues from advertising in 2017, but distrust of services like YouTube could impact how much time and money users and advertisers put into them. The company saw that risk become a reality last year when a handful of big-name companies pulled their advertisements off of YouTube in the wake of revelations about inappropriate videos exploiting children. As a result, the company vowed to hire more human content moderators. 
More recently, Logan Paul, one of YouTube's most famous video creators, sparked controversy after uploading a video featuring a dead body, driving YouTube to adopt new advertising policies and explicitly warn video creators that there would be ""consequences"" for those who do something ""egregious"" that causes ""significant harm"" to the reputation (and revenue potential) of the site as a whole.
Earlier last year, Congress also grilled Google, Facebook, and Twitter about Russian interference and the spread of fake news on their platforms in the wake of the 2016 election. Separately, reports have criticized Google for serving ads for fake news stories on fact-checking websites, delivering misleading answers via voice search on its smart speaker, and favoring conspiracy videos against Hillary Clinton through YouTube's recommendation algorithm. 
Alphabet shares are off about 8% since the company reported disappointing Q4 earnings last Thursday. 
Here is the new wording versus the wording from 2016 (emphasis added):
 2017 -  Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, content providers, and other partners.  Our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy issues and developments, and product or technical performance failures. For example, if we fail to appropriately respond to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers, or to otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading. 2016 -  Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners. Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands of both Google and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users. Our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues and product/technical performance failures.

 Leon Cooperman: Biggest threat to FANG is government   
 2:37  PM ET Wed,  7 Feb 2018 |  03:01 
 The biggest threat to Google-parent Alphabet and other big-tech companies is the U.S. government, billionaire investor Leon Cooperman told CNBC on Wednesday.
 The government ""is just looking at them,"" said Cooperman, the chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors hedge fund. ""They want to see if they can pick their pockets.""
""When you think of a company the size of Google ... putting out numbers with 20 [or] 30 percent type of growth rates. It's enormous,"" he added.
 The tech industry has had its share of clashes with the government. The most recent is Apple, after admitting to slowing down older iPhones in order to preserve battery life.
Cooperman, whose firm has approximately $3.8 billion in assets under management, said 10 percent of his portfolio is in tech stocks.
Cooperman owns stakes in Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, according to a recent SEC filing. Cooperman told CNBC on Wednesday he doesn't own shares of Apple.
The Omega chief likes Alphabet in particular, saying it has a fortress-like balance sheet.
""Google is 5 percent of our portfolio,"" Cooperman said. ""We've owned it for several years. It sells for around 22 times what we think it's going to earn this year [and] less than 20 times what we think they're going to earn next year.""
Alphabet reported disappointing fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings last week. The stock was trading down more than 1.5 percent on Wednesday.
Cooperman said a risk big tech stocks is they often trade together. ""This whole group trades like a group,"" he said. ""If one of them has a disappointment, they could all go down. That's the way the market trades.""
Cooperman expects moderate gains for the tech sector in 2018, adding ""valuations are very sound.""

 Long before they started battling it out in court, Google and Uber had a familial relationship. 
 ""It was like big brother and little brother,"" former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said as part of his testimony during the trade secrets trial between Uber and Waymo that is happening this week in San Francisco. Waymo is the self-driving car division of Google parent company Alphabet, and was spun out from Google in 2016.
When Google's venture capital arm invested $258 million into Uber in 2013, Kalanick didn't see the two companies as being competitive, since Google was working on autonomous vehicles and Uber was working on ride-sharing.

 Watch Uber, Salesforce and Alphabet execs discuss how tech companies can build trust   
 11:20  AM ET Thu, 25 Jan 2018 |  00:03 
 Google CEO Larry Page even took Kalanick for a ride in a self-driving car after the investment, and the two companies discussed possible partnerships, according to Kalanick.  
However, things started to fall apart in 2015 when rumors swirled that Google was getting into ride sharing. Kalanick emailed David Drummond, the Google exec who was on Uber's board of directors, to ask what was going on.
 As Uber lost confidence in an Google partnership coming to fruition, the company hired a bunch of autonomous vehicle engineers from Carnegie Mellon. That move, Kalanick says, upset Page. ""He was sort of angsty,"" Kalanick testified.
Ultimately, Uber acquired the self-driving truck company Otto in 2016, which was founded by a former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski, around whom this week's trial hangs.
Kalanick also testified that after Uber acquired Otto, but before Waymo filed its lawsuit, he called Page to assure him that Uber was not working on flying cars (Page had invested in two flying vehicle companies). Kalanick said that he also tried to ""broach the subject of a partnership"" but that Page was again upset with Uber for hiring Waymo engineers. Kalanick added that the two did not discuss Levandowski or trade secrets during that October 2016 call.
 Ultimately, Waymo is trying to prove that Uber improperly acquired, used, and benefited from eight ""trade secrets"" taken by Levandowski.
Over the course of the proceedings so far, Waymo's legal team has tried to paint Uber and Kalanick as desperate to catch up to its self-driving car efforts ""at all costs,"" while Uber's team has been trying to position Waymo's lawsuit against it as an act of vindictiveness.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks during Digital Unlocked Google event at Taj palace on January 4, 2017 in New Delhi, India.
 Alphabet is rolling its smart home unit, Nest, back into Google proper, the company announced in a pair of blog posts on Wednesday.
 When Alphabet blew up its corporate structure in 2015, Nest was regarded as one of the model ""Other Bets,"" but the unit subsequently experienced product struggles and the departure of its CEO. Meanwhile, Google increased its own focus on the home with its line of smart speakers, which compete with Amazon's Echo products.
The company writes that by bringing Nest back into Google, it can ""supercharge Nest's mission."" Nest's current CEO, Marwan Fawaz, will now report to Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh, and the merger will mean that Google's artificial intelligence, like its smart assistant, will be better baked into Nest products, CNET reports.
 The potential of this move was originally reported by The Wall Street Journal in December, Google CEO Sundar Pichai hinted at it during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. 
 Tweet on Sundar
 ""We've had a head start on collaborating since our teams already work closely together, and today we're excited to make Nest an integral part of Google's big bet on hardware,"" the company writes.

 Tech addiction an 'existential threat': Former Googler   
 3:31  PM ET Wed,  7 Feb 2018 |  03:58 
 Former Google employee Tristan Harris said large tech companies have a ""moral responsibility"" when it comes to shaping billions of people's attention — one he believes they are abusing in favor of profits.
 ""We're pointing the most powerful supercomputers in the world at our brains to suck the attention out of it,"" Harris, who once worked as a design ethicist at Google, told CNBC. ""Then if that stock price has to keep going up I have to actually point it at your kids.""
""I actually genuinely view this as an existential threat,"" said Harris. ""When you're shaping people's attention you're shaping their thoughts. Their thoughts precede action, and you're really shaping society and culture. ... There's an entire set of consequences when you shape people's attention through design.""
 In 2014, amid growing concern about technology's dominance in people's lives, Harris and a few other Silicon Valley tech alums founded the Center for Humane Technology, where Harris is executive director.
The group's mission: Fight the tech addiction.
""Everybody in your audience knows [about the problem] because they're addicted to their phones and concerned about some of the fallout,"" Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media, told CNBC.
Steyer and Harris were on ""Squawk on the Street"" to talk about their combined efforts to realign technology with society's best interests. 
""Technology is often exploiting how our minds work,"" said Harris, who said he first brought up the issue back in 2013 to colleagues at Google when he was employed there.
On Monday, Common Sense Media and the Center for Humane Technology announced the Truth About Tech campaign, which aims to put pressure on the tech industry and alleviate some of the problems surrounding addictions to technology. Steyer and Harris were in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday for Truth About Tech: How Tech Has Kids Hooked, a one-day conference that focuses on the impact of technology on children over time and the ethics of technology, among other things. 
The tech industry's main objective is to maximize people's attention, Harris said. Tech companies and democracy's intentions are ""fundamentally misaligned,"" he said. 
Google did not respond to a request for comment.
Harris said that on Twitter, which had approximately 330 million monthly active users in 2017, academic researchers estimate that 15 percent of users are bots. ""Most of us are interacting with these things every day and have no idea,"" Harris said of bots. ""If researchers can figure this out, then why can't Twitter? Because their stock prices depend on them telling Wall Street, 'We've got this many users.'""
A spokesperson for Twitter pointed to a blog post the company wrote last month that said, ""We recognize that Twitter is an important part of a larger ecosystem of how news and information spreads online, and that we have a responsibility to support external programs that empower our users, connecting them with resources to give them control over their online experience.""

Tony Fadell
 Some early employees of Alphabet's smart-home company Nest, including co-founder Tony Fadell, are frustrated by how the company's history has played out now that it has been rolled back into Google.
 Google bought Nest for $3.2 billion in early 2014, less than two years before it blew up its corporate structure to form the holding company Alphabet. Under Alphabet, Nest became an independent company and was heralded as the model business in the ""Other Bets"" category, which also includes Alphabet's venture capital arms, its smart city project Sidewalk and other experimental businesses.
But looking back, these early former employees say that the split ended up being a setback for both companies.
 ""From the outside it looked like Nest was the perfect poster child for Alphabet but, at the same time, separating it was undoing the thing that was most essential for both companies — figuring out how to make them work together,"" former Nest CEO Tony Fadell tells CNBC via email.
Fadell stepped down as CEO of Nest in mid-2016 after a turbulent year that included product issues and missed  revenue targets. Some employees had complaints about his management style as well, as highlighted in  an exposé by The Information.
Google reportedly tried to sell the company in 2016, but ended up keeping it.
This week, the company said that bringing Nest back into the fold would help it ""supercharge"" the company's mission. However, that phrasing felt ironic to another former Nest employee, who requested anonymity because he feared repercussions from his former employer.
This employee worked at Nest since 2011, when it was still independent, and says that when Google CEO Larry Page came to Nest employees before the acquisition, he pledged that Google would accelerate Nest's mission.
""But that didn't last two years,"" this person says.
Once Nest was turned into a separate company within the Alphabet family, there were no incentives for Google and Nest employees to work together. Nest and Google even  worked simultaneously on extremely similar products, including a protocol for smart-home products to talk to each other.
""I think it would have helped had the M&A team had put something in place in the early days to structure and incentivize Google and us in a way that would have led to more cooperation,"" a third early former employee says.
The real pain point came when Amazon released its smart speaker, Echo, in 2014. As it grew into a hit, Google subsequently increased its own focus on the home. But with Nest as a separate company, employees there were largely kept in the dark about Google's efforts, and vice versa.
""The rise of digital assistants in smart speakers and many other household objects has upended the idea of maintaining a separate company focused on the home,"" Forrester analyst Frank Gillett tells CNBC, adding that Google now needs to make up for the time it lost by quickly roll out better integration between Nest hardware products and Google artificial intelligence.
To Fadell, that should have already happened.
""Nest was acquired by Google for a specific reason,"" Fadell says. ""I pitched it as 'We are the senses and you are the brain.' For the sake of Nest customers and talent, I hope they follow through on their commitment they made to us 4 years ago instead of trying to sell it off like they did just 2 years ago.""
Nest did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On earnings calls, Google has highlighted Nest as one of the few ""Other Bets"" that generates considerable revenue, alongside healthcare company Verily and internet service Fiber. Now that Nest is no longer an ""Other Bet,"" revenue in that category could drop in Alphabet's next earnings report.
The re-merger could also result in employee attrition, as Nest workers once again find themselves part of a much larger company.
Nest's other co-founder, Matt Rogers, just announced that he plans to  depart the company in the next few months. One of the early employees CNBC spoke to says that they have already received several anxiety-ridden phone calls from people who are still at Nest who are worried about how their roles will change post-merger. Titles and roles are still being ironed out, this person says, although Google has confirmed that current Nest CEO, Marwan Fawaz, will now be reporting to Google hardware boss Rick Osterloh.
Reflecting on his more than five years at Nest, that former employees laughs ruefully: ""It was like a soap opera.""

 Google hit with $21.2 million fine for search bias in India   
 9:17  AM ET Fri,  9 Feb 2018 |  00:48 
 India's antitrust watchdog on Thursday imposed a 1.36 billion rupees ($21.17 million) fine on Google for ""search bias"" and abuse of its dominant position, in the latest regulatory setback for the world's most popular internet search engine.
 The Competition Commission of India (CCI) said Google, the core unit of U.S. firm Alphabet Inc, was abusing its dominance in online web search and online search advertising markets.
""Google was found to be indulging in practices of search bias and by doing so, it causes harm to its competitors as well as to users,"" the CCI said in a 190-page order.
 ""Google was leveraging its dominance in the market for online general web search, to strengthen its position in the market for online syndicate search services,"" the CCI said.
However, the CCI said it did not find any contravention in respect of Google's specialized search design, AdWords and online distribution agreements.
A Google spokesman said the company was reviewing the ""narrow concerns"" identified by the Commission and will assess its next steps.
""We have always focused on innovating to support the evolving needs of our users. The Competition Commission of India has confirmed that, on the majority of issues it examined, our conduct complies with Indian competition laws,"" he said.
The Indian watchdog's order is the latest antitrust setback for Google. Last year, The European Commission imposed a record 2.4 billion euro ($3 billion) fine on the company for favoring its shopping service and demoting rival offerings. Google has appealed against the order.
In India, the Commission found, that Google through its search design had placed its commercial flight search function at a prominent position on the search results page to the disadvantage of businesses trying to gain market access.
The Indian ruling brings to an end a probe first started by the watchdog in 2012 on complaints filed by matchmaking website Bharat Matrimony and a not-for-profit organisation, Consumer Unity and Trust Society (CUTS).
For infringing antitrust conduct, the Commission decided to impose a fine at the rate of 5 percent of the average total revenue generated by the company from its Indian operations.
Naval Chopra, a partner at law firm Shardul Amarchand who represented Bharat Matrimony in the case, said he was surprised by the small amount of the fine imposed on the U.S. tech giant.
""Whilst finding Google to have abused its dominant position, the CCI has nonetheless exercised restraint in recognizing the dynamic nature of online markets and not found Google guilty of every allegation,"" Chopra told Reuters.
The CCI also expressed disappointment with Google for saying it was not possible to collate all the revenue data in the time allotted.
Google will need to deposit the fine within 60 days, the Commission said. The order was passed by a majority of 4-2 with two members dissenting.
