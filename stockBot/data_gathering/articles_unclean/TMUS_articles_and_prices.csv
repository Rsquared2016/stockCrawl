Taylor Swift and Drake
 AT&T and T-Mobile may be declaring victory among the mobile carriers this earnings season, but the real winner is another group entirely: Drake fans.
 All three major wireless carriers saw less adjusted revenue than expected during the latest quarter, with AT&T reporting results on Tuesday and T-Mobile a day earlier.  But as they roll out unlimited data plans to compete, consumers are using more bandwidth than ever — a boon to artists like Drake. 
T-Mobile sees data volumes growing about 40 percent year-over-year, technology chief Neville Ray told analysts on a conference call, with operating chief G. Michael Sievert adding that ""the era of the data bucket is over."" AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson noted that unlimited data plans increase mobile video usage and ""made an already competitive market even more so.""
 Verizon said last week that the launch of Verizon Unlimited helped stem customer losses toward the end of the quarter, noting that LTE data traffic increased 57 percent over the prior year in the first quarter.
 Streaming has hit new highs
 Meanwhile, Drake's new album ""More Life"" hit a record in March for most streams in a single week in the U.S., according to Nielsen.
While it's unclear how many of those are on mobile, it's increasingly becoming the medium of choice as data restrictions loosen. An Accenture report published this week saw a steep decline among those who prefer a TV set to laptops, desktops and smartphones.
Other streaming services have also made big strides on mobile. Netflix, for instance, added slightly fewer-than-expected subscribers in the first quarter, but that didn't stop it from crushing rivals in the App Store, where Sensor Tower estimates sales grew 63 percent in the first quarter. Six of Sensor Tower's top non-game apps by revenue were for streaming video or music. Just last week, YouTube jumped to the top of the App Store thanks to live streaming, according to separate data.
So while Drake's fans ""used to call him on his cell phone,"" maybe now they are using it to stream him instead.

SoftBank Group Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son speaks during a press conference on May 10, 2017 in Tokyo, Japan.
 SoftBank will seek talks to merge its US mobile business Sprint with rival T-Mobile USA to trigger a long-awaited consolidation in the US telecoms sector, according to its chief executive."" Our top choice remains T-Mobile. We will be open and sincere as we aim to launch negotiations,"" Masayoshi Son,
""Our top choice remains T-Mobile. We will be open and sincere as we aim to launch negotiations,"" Masayoshi Son, billionaire founder of the Japanese internet and telecoms group, said at a news conference in Tokyo for its full-year results.
US telecom groups have been temporarily unable to discuss deals during a government-run auction of airwaves. Investors are now bracing for a flurry of deals following completion of the spectrum auction amid hopes the new US administration will be more open to deals that would transform the industry.
 More from Financial Times: South Korea's Moon Jae-in offers olive branch at inaugurationUK tech investors face loss of significant funding after BrexitMacron's luck persists as economic recovery gathers pace
T-Mobile, the third-largest US wireless carrier, is seen as the potential kingmaker as companies including Sprint, Dish and Comcast weigh their options. By aggressively acquiring airwave capacity worth $8bn across the US, T-Mobile, however, does not seem as desperate to find a merger partner.
Mr Son also said he would explore possibilities other than a combination with T-Mobile: ""We're basically open to anything. If there is an opportunity that will lead to industry realignment under better conditions, we will study [each option] with an open mind.""
A combination of Sprint and T-Mobile USA, which is controlled by Germany's Deutsche Telekom, has been discussed in the past given the prospect of bringing together the two smaller US mobile networks to better challenge AT&T and Verizon.
However, the deal encountered opposition among competition regulators. Mr Son said that the US administration was now more open to the possibility of a deal.
Mr Son's comments came as SoftBank, which also owns UK chip designer Arm, is nearing the launch of a Saudi-backed $100bn investment fund.
Mr Son said most of the Vision Fund details have been worked out as the billionaire seeks the firepower to pursue ambitious deals without further increasing the group's debt level.
The biggest investor in the Vision Fund is Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, which said last year it would contribute up to $45bn, while SoftBank is putting in about $25bn. Others planning to invest at a smaller scale include Apple, Qualcomm and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, as well as Foxconn, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer.
Earlier on Wednesday, SoftBank said its net profit for the fiscal year that ended in March more than tripled from a year earlier to ¥1.43tn ($12.5bn), topping the ¥1tn mark for the first time.
Sprint posted a deeper than expected net loss in its most recent quarter but has shown signs of a turnround under chief executive Marcelo Claure by improving its network and cutting prices.
Mr Son also confirmed SoftBank has been consulted by Foxconn about a bid for Toshiba's flash memory business. People with knowledge of the talks have said Foxconn, which is listed as Hon Hai Precision Industry, has also approached Apple about a potential joint bid for the chip division that Toshiba wants to sell for at least $20bn.
""It is true that we have received various consultations, but we are not the main player. This is a deal that should be mainly studied by Foxconn and Apple,"" Mr Son said.

 Deutsche Telekom owns a 64 percent stake in T-Mobile, according to FactSet. ""Sprint Corp. has started preliminary conversations to merge with T-Mobile US Inc. ...

 Legere: Key drivers to T-Mobile's success   
 6:57  PM ET Mon, 24 April 2017 |  01:28 
 T-Mobile has a current market value of $54 billion compared with Sprint's $32 billion, according to FactSet. Given the size of the companies a merger between the two wireless carriers would be the largest deal of the year.
 Johnson & Johnson's $31.4 billion acquisition of Actelion in January was the biggest deal so far in 2017, according to Dealogic data. ""The TMT [tech media telecom] sector has been one of the hottest sectors in the last few years, and if a T-Mobile-Sprint merger goes ahead, it would push deal volume in this sector this year to levels not seen since before the financial crisis,"" Dealogic's head of Americas M&A research, Agnieszka Zalecka, wrote in an email. ""The deal will face huge regulatory scrutiny, and previous talks for Sprint to buy T-Mobile fell through in 2014 because of regulatory concerns.""As mentioned, Sprint was forced to abandon its attempt to acquire T-Mobile three years ago. However, the companies may believe large telecom consolidation is possible under the President Donald Trump administration. Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges also hinted Thursday, he is open to a T-Mobile deal. ""Purely theoretically, we can see several advantages to consolidation and convergence,"" Hoettges said according to a Reuters report. ""The strong position we have established for ourselves gives us the time and space to evaluate all options together with colleagues in the U.S."" If the merger talks get serious, other companies may decide to jump into the fray. Bloomberg News reported in April that Sprint thinks it may get acquisition interest from cable companies such as Comcast, Charter and Altice. Sprint shares closed up 1 percent on Friday, while T-Mobile stock closed down slightly negative. Both companies did not immediately return requests for comment. Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

5,2017-05-19,Here’s who loses big time if Sprint and T-Mobile are allowed to merge  Goldman says T-Mobile is a great buy even if it doesn't get acquired  ,"Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty Images
SoftBank Group Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son speaks during a press conference on May 10, 2017 in Tokyo, Japan.
 Washington is awash in speculation that the nation's major communications companies are again looking for consolidation opportunities that could reduce consumer choice. The end of the FCC's spectrum auction, during which companies were prohibited from talking to each other, just may be the starting gun for a merger melee. The question is how the Trump Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission will rule on such consolidations.
 President Trump has been an advocate of competition in the marketplace. We – the former heads of the DOJ's Antitrust Division and the FCC – agree with the president. Consumers lose when companies no longer need to compete on price, quality, service and contract terms. Once competitors are allowed to consolidate, the bell cannot be unrung. Short of a massive breakup effort, the reduction in competition is permanent.
Prices for wireless service — where there are four vigorous national competitors — are down nearly 13 percent in the past year, according to the latest CPI report from the Labor Department. Compare that with cable prices, where a lack of competition has allowed prices to increase 5 percent in the same time period.
 When the government blocks mergers between competitors, good things happen. Recent events confirm our view. Back in 2011, AT&T sought to acquire its smaller rival T-Mobile, reducing the national providers of wireless service from four to three. The FCC and the Department of Justice sued to block the deal and it ultimately was abandoned.

John Legere, chief executive officer of T-Mobile US.
 In the years that followed, competition reigned. An independent T-Mobile went maverick, abandoning standard-issue terms like two-year contracts and data limits. It spent billions of dollars improving the products it offers; it fought to woo customers by offering lower prices and better services; and it gave customers freedom of choice by offering to pay the early termination fees for those who switched to T-Mobile. T-Mobile's competitors were compelled to respond. Sprint began offering lower prices and better plans. AT&T targeted T-Mobile customers with a $200 credit, plus money for smartphone trade-ins, if they switched to AT&T. T-Mobile responded by offering plans that allow customers to upgrade their phones twice a year. The competition then matched these plans.
Things got so intense that Sprint's owners — SoftBank — approached the two of us a couple of years ago to argue that they should be allowed to buy T-Mobile. The idea of eliminating a pesky rival may have made sense for Sprint. But not for the American consumer. We made that clear, and Sprint reluctantly ditched the idea.
And what has happened since? Competition remains the gift that keeps on giving. When Verizon became the last of the big four wireless carriers to offer an unlimited data plan, they proved, yet again, that competition works. Would that have happened with fewer competitors? Think again, or better yet, look at what has happened in the absence of such competition in cable.
Yet the press reports that SoftBank may once again seek to eliminate its rival T-Mobile, perhaps believing that it will find more sympathetic ears in the new administration. But the merger made no sense before, and it makes no sense today. Ensuring that competition works to consumers' benefit makes policing mergers among competitors a priority that transcends party and politics. Without it, you pay the price. Let's hope the president's professed belief in competition continues and that our successors at DOJ and the FCC act responsibly to block any renewed attempts to stymie the robust wireless competition that consumers are now enjoying.

A T-Mobile store in Chicago, Illinois.
 Goldman Sachs told investors to buy T-Mobile shares, predicting the wireless carrier will thrive financially in the coming years, even if it doesn't participate in industry consolidation.
 The bank added T-Mobile to its Americas conviction buy list and reiterated its buy rating.
""While investors have been focused on M&A given recent press reports, we believe that TMUS's valuation remains attractive based on two potential standalone catalysts: (1) material capital returns as TMUS delevers, and (2) upside to subscriber growth forecasts as TMUS expands distribution,"" analyst Brett Feldman wrote in the note to clients Friday. ""Our analysis that T-Mobile could support a material share repurchase program on a standalone basis should limit downside risk if a proposed transaction is blocked by regulators.""
 The analyst raised his T-Mobile price target to $81 from $74, representing 23 percent upside from Thursday's close. Feldman cited T-Mobile chief financial officer Braxton Carter's earnings conference call comments saying it is looking to return ""cash to our shareholders."" The analyst predicts T-Mobile will be able to return 66 percent of its current market value during the next five years based on his cash-flow and profit growth estimates.
However, the analyst isn't downplaying the potential for wireless industry consolidation.
""We believe market share leaders in the US fixed and mobile sectors may look to acquire companies that accelerate or improve their ability to deliver converged services. As such, we believe that TMUS may be positioned for a series of M&A,"" he wrote.  Bloomberg News reported Sprint approached T-Mobile-owner Deutsche Telekom to discuss a merger with the U.S. wireless carrier on May 12, amid an already hot telecom deal market. T-Mobile's Carter also hinted the company would be open to a merger with Sprint and consolidation with other cable companies at a conference Thursday, according to a Reuters report.""What about Sprint, T-Mobile and a coalition of Comcast and Charter and the value creation that could come out of that?"" Carter said. ""From a shareholder standpoint, that could be very, very exciting.""

 T-Mobile announced a new promotion on Wednesday targeting Verizon Wireless customers to move to its network.
 T-Mobile is offering to pay the full balance of Verizon customers' phone lease — up to $1,000 — if they switch from Verizon.
The move is an effort by T-Mobile to continue its subscriber growth. The carrier added a higher-than-expected 914,000 subscribers during the first quarter, thanks to similar offerings that have lured customers.
 Verizon's wireless revenues were down 5.1 percent during the first quarter, when it said it lost 307,000 subscribers.
T-Mobile said its new offer applies to customers who are signing up for a new T-Mobile One service line with device protection. T-Mobile One, the company's unlimited service, starts at $70 for one line. Device protection costs an additional $15 per month.
T-Mobile says customers who make the switch will receive a prepaid MasterCard within 15 days, and that customers will be able to keep their same phone number.
The promotion starts on May 31.

 A combined T-Mobile-Sprint could pose a ""powerful"" threat to telecom giant AT&T, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure told CNBC on Thursday.
 ""We have looked at every other alternative to make sure we are making the right decision,"" Claure said on ""Halftime Report."" ""If the government works to allow us to combine, we'll be No. 3, but we'll be a formidable competitor and we'll continue to disrupt the industry.""
The Sprint chief spoke after a meeting at the White House with President Donald Trump and other tech leaders to discuss the potential impact of emerging technologies on U.S. industrial workers, among other topics.
 Representatives from Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile were also at the meeting, Claure said.
On Tuesday, German business newspaper Handelsblatt reported that Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's parent, was prepping documents for a potential merger with Sprint. T-Mobile declined to comment but sources said the company is sounding out if there are any government objections to a deal, the newspaper reported. 
T-Mobile did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.
Wall Street has frequently speculated about a possible merger of the two companies.
On the regulatory issues of such a deal, Claure said with more companies in the telecom market, like Comcast and Google, it is less likely to raise an eyebrow from the government. ""You're talking seven or eight formidable competitors today,"" he said.
More importantly, ""we're going to need to make some serious investments in order to bring 5G to the United States,"" he added. ""And that's going to require to the tune of $40 to $50 billion of investments.""

 Sprint reportedly in talks with Charter, Comcast: WSJ   
 8:16  AM ET Tue, 27 June 2017 |  03:58 
 Sprint may have a new chance at success, and it doesn't involve a T-Mobile merger, Wells Fargo senior analyst Jennifer Fritzsche told CNBC on Tuesday.
 Fritzsche spoke a day after The Wall Street Journal reported that Sprint has entered into exclusive talks with Charter and Comcast on a potential deal for the cable companies to offer wireless services on the carrier's network.
CNBC's David Faber confirms talks are taking place, but his sources say any expectation either Comcast or Charter would take an equity stake in or pursue an outright buyout of Sprint is unlikely. Sprint's merger talks with T-Mobile have been put on hold, reports the Journal.
 The new Sprint talks come as Wall Street chatter has speculated that a T-Mobile-Sprint merger could be imminent. Sprint and Charter declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. A Comcast spokesperson declined to comment.
""Many think that Sprint really had its back against the wall and many thought if T-Mobile were to happen, it would essentially be a take-under,"" Fritzsche said on ""Squawk Box."" The new deal ""might call that into significant question.""
Shares of Sprint were up 2 percent in premarket on Tuesday, above $8 a share. 
Fritzsche said Sprint could offer Charter and Comcast many benefits to the deal as well. ""What Sprint brings to the table is a tremendous spectrum position,"" Fritzsche said. ""Think of Sprint as an old house with great bones that needs a lot of work.""

12,2017-07-06,"T-Mobile quietly boosts price of premium plan, which now costs as much as Verizon  ","Mark Neuling | CNBC
John Legere
 T-Mobile quietly increased the price of its T-Mobile One Plus plan by $5, bringing the total cost of a single line with the premium add-on to $80 per month instead of $75.
This is the same price a customer would pay on Verizon for a similar unlimited plan, and it marks a stark move from T-Mobile's position as an affordable wireless carrier. Verizon is often known as one of the most expensive, though premium, carriers in the United States.
 A spokesperson for T-Mobile said the original price was for a promotional period, which has now ended.
T-Mobile's website has been updated to reflect the changes. A single unlimited line costs $70 but limits video streaming to DVD quality and includes support for providing data connectivity for a laptop, but only at 3G speeds.
 T-Mobile
 T-Mobile One Plus includes faster data for laptop hotspots (though with a 10GB monthly max), unlimited Gogo in-flight Wi-Fi service, and unlimited HD streaming. It used to cost an additional $5 per month but now costs $10 per month.
The change doesn't appear to affect customers who already locked in the lower rate.
Meanwhile, Verizon charges $80 for a single line that includes unlimited data, text, HD video streaming and mobile hotspot. It doesn't offer the same benefits for international travel as T-Mobile does, however.

 T-Mobile beats the Street   
 5:53  PM ET Wed, 19 July 2017 |  20:40 
 T-Mobile posted quarterly earnings on Wednesday that far exceeded Wall Street's wildest expectations.
 Customers flocked to T-Mobile during the quarter, according to the company's financial results, which showed record low churn of postpaid phone service for the telecom company. The mobile carrier's net adds, a key measure of the number of customers added during the quarter, hit 1.33 million, exceeding the 807,000 expected by Street Account.
Business customers are also a burgeoning source of growth for T-Mobile, CEO John Legere said on a conference call.
 The results temporarily halted the stock in after-hours trading. Shares edged higher after trading halt was lifted.
 Earnings fly past estimates
 EPS: 67 cents per share vs. 38 cents per share expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimates Revenue: $10.21 billion vs. $9.81 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate 
That's up compared to earnings of 25 cents per share on revenue of $9.29 billion in the year-ago period.
 The battle of the unlimited data plans
 Mobile carriers have been in fierce competition over the past year as consumers have pushed trends like unlimited data plans and the end of contract commitments. T-Mobile saw data volumes growing about 40 percent year-over-year, technology chief Neville Ray told analysts on a conference call last quarter.
The advent of faster internet speeds, coming with 5G-compatible phone chips, is likely to accelerate the competition for wireless customers. The ""super cycle"" of iPhone 8 customers expected by analysts could also pose an unprecedented challenge for carriers.
Legere said there's no ""magic"" behind T-Mobile's quarterly results, crediting the beat to investments in the network and ""good, old-fashioned focus"" from engineers.
""This was a competitive quarter,"" Legere said. ""It was the first full quarter with all the unlimited plans on the market.""

 T-Mobile shares rose over 4 percent in premarket trading Thursday, a day after the telecommunications company announced quarterly earnings that far surpassed expectations.
 Later in the morning, T-Mobile shares dipped 0.4 percent lower from Wednesday's close.
Second-quarter revenue of $10.21 billion thrashed Reuters estimates of $9.81 billion. Net adds, which are an important measure of the number of customers added during the quarter, hit 1.33 million, exceeding the 807,000 expected by Street Account.

T-Mobile has been embroiled in intense competition with other mobile carriers as consumers increasingly demand unlimited data plans ahead of the release of 5G phone chips.

15,2017-08-02,Verizon and AT&T customers are getting slower speeds because of unlimited data plans  ,"Getty Images
Lowell McAdam, CEO, Verizon Communications
 Unlimited data plans are slowing down mobile speeds for Verizon and AT&T customers, according to  data released today by mobile network measurement company OpenSignal.
Verizon and AT&T reinstated their unlimited plans in February to compete with T-Mobile and Sprint, which have long offered unlimited data plans, and have since seen a deluge of demand.
Greater data demand — either more data usage or more customers — means slower speeds. Think of it as increased traffic on a highway. Verizon and AT&T also have  nearly double the subscribers of T-Mobile and Sprint, so changes in their offerings hit their networks harder.

Carriers have long supported greater leeway to manage their networks as part of the U.S. government's fierce debate over net neutrality. T-Mobile's unlimited plan  often limits video streaming quality in a bid to ease the burden on its network; others like Verizon recently have tested similar tools to improve speeds. To staunch advocates of open internet rules, however, these techniques  violate the spirit of federal safeguards meant to ensure all web traffic is treated equally.
Both Verizon and AT&T saw a notable decline in speeds after introducing unlimited plans. T-Mobile and Sprint have been able to gradually account for the increase in data demand, so their speeds weren't negatively affected this year — indeed, they both got faster since OpenSignal's February report.
U.S. mobile speeds are generally  slower than other developed countries.
Verizon and T-Mobile were basically tied for speeds at the beginning of this year. Now, T-Mobile has taken the lead with an average LTE download speed of 17.5 Mbps, compared with Verizon's 14.9 Mbps.
Unsurprisingly, unlimited data plans are very popular, as consumers spend more time and complete more activities on their phones.  Ericsson expects typical North American smartphone users to blow through 25 GB of data a month in 2022, up from 5 GB in 2016, making unlimited data plans even more appealing. 
For this report, OpenSignal collected over five billion measurements from 172,919 U.S. smartphones during the month of June with its signal mapping app.
CNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.

John Legere
 In a Monday morning press release announcing an aggressively priced new wireless smartphone plan T-Mobile jokes that you might want to get a fake ID.
Not to prove you've come of drinking age, but rather you reached the age bracket to qualify for the T-Mobile One Unlimited 55+ plan, a monthly two-line unlimited plan for Baby Boomers that costs $60, taxes and fees included.
A single person 55 or older pays $50 for the first line. The second person—who can be ""underage"" in this scenario—pays just $10 more. To qualify for the lower rates, you'll have to enroll in auto pay.
 More from USA Today: Sprint and T-Mobile again exploring merger, report saysTropical Storm Franklin could reach hurricane strength before hitting near CancunNew device can heal with a single touch, and even repair brain injuries
The new plan, which kicks in August 9, really is targeted at empty nesters—a third person in a household would have to pay full price.
The savings under T-Mobile's 55+ plan can be significant. The current regular T-Mobile One offering costs $70 a month for a single line, or, under a temporary promotion, $100 a month for two lines. The regular two-line fee is $160.
T-Mobile's outspoken CEO John Legere says that the carriers have long ""patronized"" this older segment of the market, the very folks he says that ""invented wireless."" Rivals, he says, offer senior-oriented plans that curtail the number of voice minutes and data. The T-Mobile 55+ plan comes with unlimited, talk, text and 4G LTE data.
According to T-Mobile, nearly three-fourths of the more than 93 million Americans in the U.S. over the age of 55 have a smartphone, with Boomers spending an average of 149 minutes a day on handsets, compared to the 171 minutes consumed by Millennials.
Older smartphone consumers haven't been completely ignored. I recently wrote about Consumer Cellular, a Portland, Ore., company that ironically leases lines from T-Mobile (as well as AT&T) under a reseller agreement known to the industry as an MVNO, shorthand for Mobile Virtual Network Operator.  Consumer Cellular sells no-frills senior-phones and offers discounted service to the AARP crowd, though its customers can also purchase iPhones and a few other higher-priced models. It has monthly voice minute plans that start at just $10, with the average customer paying around $25. But it doesn't offer an unlimited data plan, and its $40 max data plan caps at 5GB, after which each extra gig costs $10.
T-Mobile says customers who qualify for its new 55+ plan, can use any of the smartphones the company sells, iPhones, Samsung devices and other top-tier models. And they get the benefits other T-Mobile customers do, including unlimited text and data roaming and low calling rates in more than 140 countries, help with the cost of switching to T-Mobile from a rival carrier, and mobile ""hotspot"" tethering.
There are some fine print details to keep in mind. Tethering is at poky ""3G"" speeds. And T-Mobile says video typically streams at 480P resolution, with speeds slowed down until the next bill cycle during congested periods for the top 3% of data users. A SIM starter kit for customers who want to bring their own smartphones, costs $25.
T-Mobile hopes to crack a Verizon Wireless-AT&T stronghold, with the top two U.S. carriers controlling about 80% of this Boomer segment. While T-Mobile claims 18% of all U.S. wireless customers, it has just 8% of this older group.

 ""T-Mobile One"" family plans now include Netflix for free.
 It's T-Mobile's latest move to continue shaking up the wireless industry.
The free Netflix subscription applies to T-Mobile One plans with two or more lines, so customers don't need to sign up for anything else to take advantage of the offer. Keep in mind that T-Mobile limits streaming to DVD quality unless you pay extra, which means you can't really take full advantage of the super sharp display on your smartphone.
 T-Mobile said customers can activate Netflix by calling T-Mobile, visiting the carrier's website or walking into a carrier store beginning on Sept. 12.

This doesn't mean every person on the account gets his or her own Netflix account; rather, it's a single account that can be shared by a family. Other carriers offer similar incentives. AT&T, for example, includes its DirecTV Now streaming TV service for free on some qualifying plans.

 Cramer Remix: Why the Sprint & T-Mobile tie-up might be a done deal   
 10:23  AM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 |  01:11 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer always wants investors to be skeptical, not complacent, and question when the market seems like it's running too far too fast. But he's having a high-quality problem.
 ""Every time I feel like saying, 'Thank goodness Larry David's coming back, because you need to curb your enthusiasm for this market,' something good happens and makes me like it all over again,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
The first market-mover that made Cramer feel this way was ""Squawk on the Street"" host David Faber's scoop on Tuesday that telecom giants T-Mobile and Sprint were having merger talks.
 Several years ago, the market wouldn't have budged, writing the potential merger off as anti-competitive and anti-consumer, Cramer said.
But under a new, pro-business administration, Wall Street seems to have embraced the idea of mergers of this scope occurring under President Donald Trump.
""We'd be blind to ignore the large number of takeovers that are now occurring each week, and, perhaps more important, like the potential Sprint-T-Mobile combination, I think the Trump administration may bless every one of them,"" Cramer said.
 Surviving in Retail

A Kohl's store in San Rafael, Calif.
 In the dog-eat-dog world that is the retail sector, Cramer says there's only one ground rule.
""Don't just stand there. Do something before the grim reaper comes to get you,"" Cramer said. ""That's how I feel about this amazing Kohl's-Amazon deal that allows you to return merchandise that you bought at Amazon to a Kohl's, which will box it and send it back to the online behemoth for free.""
Cramer has always liked Kohl's thanks to its reliability, conservative attitude and strategic locations. Strip malls are ideal for returning purchased items, he said. And because the Amazon deal will only go into effect at 82 Kohl's stores in Chicago and Los Angeles, Cramer figured the inevitable expansion to the East Coast would be welcome.
The ""Mad Money"" host even recommended that investors consider buying the stock now given its 5 percent dividend yield, the promise of the deal and the retailer's strong balance sheet.
But Kohl's isn't the only company taking steps to avoid being crushed by Amazon.
 Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Equifax, Wells Fargo

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, questions John Stumpf, chief executive officer of Wells Fargo & Co., during the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2016.
 Few lawmakers had stronger words for Wells Fargo in the continued conflict surrounding the big bank's malpractices than Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
""This is a company that, from the very top, has made it clear there's no accountability here,"" the Democratic senator told Cramer in an exclusive interview on Tuesday.
While Wells Fargo's earnings remained intact, the bank is said to have pressured employees to open unauthorized accounts for customers, an issue that was recently found to have affected more customer accounts than previously thought.
""This is not about serving consumers,"" Warren said. ""This is all about, quarter by quarter by quarter, how to juice the reported profits. That's what mattered at Wells Fargo.""
To Warren, preventing large corporations from misdeeds like these by holding top executives accountable is a priority. And the senator thinks the Federal Reserve can help her do so.
 Centene CEO Talks GOP Health Care Proposal
 Then, Cramer sat down with Michael Neidorff, the chairman and CEO of government-sponsored health care enterprise Centene Corporation.
Neidorff said that while Centene would be able to accommodate the newly proposed Republican health care bill, the policy itself should not make the cut.
""If they pass this bill, we'll do OK. We know how to do block grants, we're very decentralized, local relationships with states – we'll do just fine,"" Neidorff told Cramer on Tuesday. ""From a public policy standpoint, there's no way this should pass. Why? Because you're going to have, potentially, 50 different health plans in every state. The funding is not known. States don't know what they're going to get or not get going forward. They're rushing through a piece of legislation. They're not thinking about what they want to move to, they're thinking about what they want to change.""
But Centene is more focused on its recent $3.75 billion deal to buy Fidelis Care, a New York Medicare provider.
""We're going to do is we're going to give them systems that's going to make them even more effective than what they are now,"" Neidorff said. ""All the management's staying. It's going to be business as usual using our balance sheet and our systems just to strengthen them even further. And what was important for us is, if you're entering the state of New York, you can't tiptoe in. This is the largest plan they have in this business. We want to be there. It makes us the largest company in the four largest states.""
 Pitney Bowes CEO: Reinventing Mail
 Finally, Cramer spoke with Pitney Bowes President and CEO Marc Lautenbach, who expanded on how his century-old mail company is reinventing its mission.
""We're not going to own the packages, that's what our customers do. We're not going to move the packages, that's what FedEx and UPS and USPS do. But we're going to take the complexity out of shipping and the way we're going to do that is a series of applications delivered on an Android device offered as a Software as a Service,"" Lautenbach told Cramer on Tuesday.
Software as a Service, known in the technology community as SAAS, has been sweeping the technology community. It means companies can offer software-based services as their products rather than hard assets, a strategy that Pitney Bowes is wholeheartedly embracing.
Now, Lautenbach said his company, once ""a monolithic, analog, single-application,"" is moving to ""a digitally connected, Software as a Service application, certainly around mail, also around shipping, but also around a series of other applications as well.""
 Lightning Round: One Oil Or the Other?
 In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
Marathon Oil Corporation: ""No, we like Marathon [Petroleum], not Marathon Oil, because we think very strongly that the ENP companies aren't as good right now as the refiners.""
Healthcare Trust of America: ""I think it's a very good company, yields 4 percent. I'm OK with it.""

 T-Mobile, Sprint in merger talks: Sources   
 10:33  AM ET Tue, 19 Sept 2017 |  04:43 
 T-Mobile and Sprint are in active talks about a merger, according to people close to the situation.
 Both companies and their parents, Deutsche Telekom and Softbank, have been in frequent conversations about a stock-for-stock merger in which T-Mobile parent Deutsche Telekom would emerge as the majority owner.
People close to the situation stress that negotiators are still weeks away from finalizing a deal and believe the chances of reaching an agreement are not assured. The two sides have not yet set an exchange ratio for a deal, but are currently engaged in talks to hammer out a term sheet.
 The companies declined to comment on the report.
T-Mobile and Sprint have had a seemingly endless dalliance over the years since Softbank took control of Sprint, pushed by the prospect of billions of dollars in cost synergies that a merger would bring. The last time the two companies held meaningful talks earlier this year, Softbank's Masayoshi Son indicated a willingness to sell Sprint to T-Mobile.
This time, given the all-stock nature contemplated, Softbank would emerge as a large minority holder in any combination. While T-Mobile CEO John Legere is expected to lead any combination that results from a merger, Son has made it clear he wants a say in how the company is run. That desire adds another layer of complexity to an already difficult transaction.
T-Mobile has not begun due diligence on Sprint, yet another step that could change current price expectations or the willingness to move forward.
The biggest issue is whether any merger between the No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers in the nation would be approved by antitrust regulators. The risk of rejection by the Department of Justice will play an important role in the final decision made by both sides as to whether they will proceed with a deal.
Given Softbank's high level of engagement on a Sprint-T-Mobile deal, its quixotic campaign to try to buy Charter Communications has slowed considerably. The effort is on hold. CNBC has reported it involved the creation of a new company infused with vast amounts of equity and debt to buy Charter at a premium and the 17 percent of Sprint that Softbank does not own. Dutch telecom company Altice has been actively soliciting funds to mount its own bid for Charter should Softbank make a move.

 3 major deals made Cramer check his discipline   
 6:31  PM ET Tue, 19 Sept 2017 |  01:00 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer always wants investors to be skeptical, not complacent, and question when the market seems like it's running too far too fast. But he's having a high-quality problem.
 ""Every time I feel like saying, 'Thank goodness Larry David's coming back, because you need to curb your enthusiasm for this market,' something good happens and makes me like it all over again,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
The first market-mover that made Cramer feel this way was ""Squawk on the Street"" host David Faber's scoop on Tuesday that telecom giants T-Mobile and Sprint were having merger talks.
 Both stocks popped on the news, with T-Mobile shares gaining 5 percent and Sprint jumping nearly 7 percent.
But ever since T-Mobile's stock sold off on a solid earnings report, all of the big four telecom stocks — T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon and AT&T — had been struggling.
""Then you get this news and boom, it's like a whole new world of possibilities for shareholders of both companies,"" Cramer said.
Several years ago, the market wouldn't have budged, writing the potential merger off as anti-competitive and anti-consumer, Cramer said.
But under a new, pro-business administration, Wall Street seems to have embraced the idea of a merger of this scope occurring under President Donald Trump.
""Look, I want to be as skeptical as all get out after this run that we've had, after this tape, after these miserable numbers that came out after the close. But then we get these kinds of takeovers and they make it hard for me to be as critical, as corroded, as sardonic as I'd like to be,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""More important, these deals are anything but isolated.""
Cramer pointed to Post Holdings' $1.5 billion deal to buy Bob Evans Farms, an acquisition that would add an assortment of frozen breakfast foods to Post Holdings' largely cereal-based brand portfolio.
Shares of Bob Evans surged 6 percent on news of the deal even as the stock is up 55 percent for the year, confirming the market's appetite for deals.
Finally, Cramer turned to defense contractor Northrop Grumman's $7.8 billion bid to buy Orbital ATK. Both stocks went up on the news, a sign of the market's bullishness on the deal.
""Throughout the discussion of the takeover, ... one thing that wasn't even mentioned as a possibility [was] that maybe it would be blocked by the Justice Department's antitrust division,"" Cramer said. ""This administration is demonstrating a real love of laissez-faire economics and massive deregulation, which is why all of these deals could pass muster.""
In other words, concerns that these deals would limit competition and give fewer companies price control over their products have thus far gone unvoiced despite threats to consumers like higher phone bills.
That being said, Cramer acknowledged that these massive deals are fabulous for investors if the Justice Department lets them slide.
""Again, I want to be skeptical of this rally. We've had a much-too-much big move than I ever thought could happen. Some of these valuations are difficult to defend. Profit-taking would be natural to happen here. I think it's worth taking some,"" Cramer said. ""But when you see these kinds of deals, the bottom line is that it's awfully hard to be as disciplined as you might like. When discipline constantly costs you money, you have to start worrying if your discipline's misplaced, which is why many will need the fortitude to stay in the market rather than run from it after some negative news this evening. After all, to be in has been the smart call. If the Justice Department really decides to look the other way, then this wave of mergers is still early and it will last for as long as the market keeps greeting each deal with tremendous love for the acquirer.""

Thanks to a recent T-Mobile promotion, we joined up on a family plan under Mike's name that lowers our bills from $135 every month to $90.
 Mike pays the bill in full every month, and I Venmo him my share. It could work great and save me $500 a year. It could also be a disaster.
In the CNBC Make It and Bustle series, ""Young Money,"" we explore how the issues surrounding money and friends are not to be taken lightly. We even created a Roommate Prenup to protect you when you decide to share space with a buddy. Why?

 How to split the check with friends when you're on a budget

 With that in mind, I surprised myself by agreeing to this deal with Mike. It seems like the exact scenario that may come back to haunt me in eight months. What if Mike forgets to pay the bill and I'm left stranded without my phone.
Mike was also a little nervous: What if I stiffed him for the bill? (I would never!)

 With the Roommate Prenup in mind, I wrote out a quick email to Mike that said, ""I promise to always Venmo you cell phone money ASAP as long as you promise to always pay the bill on time.""
He wrote back, ""You've got my word.""
 Does this really mean anything in a legal sense? Probably not. So, just in case, I also called T-Mobile, and a rep assured me that it is always possible to pay my share of the bill on my own, since the costs are separated under two different phone lines.
Doing the research to make sure I can save money and still look out for No. 1 made me feel comfortable entering this agreement with a friend. It also saved Mike and me from potentially straining our friendship down the road over a cell phone bill.

 T-Mobile, Sprint deal talks moving forward: Sources   
 10:02  AM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  03:02 
 Talks between T-Mobile and Sprint for a stock-for-stock deal that makes Deutsche Telekom the controlling owner are moving forward, sources tell CNBC's David Faber.
 However, some T-Mobile shareholders are frustrated with the deal price, these sources said.
As previously reported by CNBC, the exchange ratio for the stocks is expected to be at market. The deal price range continues to be locked on an exchange ratio that gives no further premium above Sprint's current value, sources said.
 Shares of Sprint fell 0.89 percent in morning trading, to $7.81. They are down 7 percent year-to-date. T-Mobile US shares rose 0.21 percent, to $61.83. They are up 7.56 percent this year.
T-Mobile is owned by Deutsche Telekom while Sprint is controlled by SoftBank. The two have talked off and on over the years about a deal, including talks earlier this year. A big issue would be whether U.S. regulators would sign off on a merger of the third and fourth-largest wireless carriers or block it on anti-trust grounds.

 Due diligence continues on a potential tie-up of Sprint and T-Mobile, sources tell CNBC, and the deal teams are targeting an announcement by early to mid-November.
 Sprint and T-Mobile have been negotiating a stock-for-stock deal that was expected to make Deutsche Telekom the controlling owner. The parties had been aiming to reach an agreement by the third week of October, but the review is taking a long time, particularly on the T-Mobile side of the table as deal teams comb through Sprint's off-balance sheet entities.
The companies are also reporting earnings this week and next week. T-Mobile reported profit of $550 million, or 63 cents a shares, beating expectations of 46 cents a share.
 The merger of the nation's third and fourth largest  mobile phone carriers would raise questions about whether regulators would allow the combination or block it on antitrust grounds.
Sprint shares were up 0.8 percent in morning trading. T-Mobile traded up 1.95 percent.

 The merger negotiations to combine Sprint and T-Mobile are in jeopardy, according to a Nikkei report Monday.
 ""SoftBank Group plans to break off negotiations on a merger between subsidiary Sprint and T-Mobile US amid a failure to agree on ownership of the combined entity,"" the Japanese financial news agency said.
Nikkei said the point of contention was over T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom's request to have control over the combined company. SoftBank reportedly decided it ""would not give up control.""
 Reuters and Dow Jones both confirmed that SoftBank was hesitant to give up control of Sprint.
Sprint shares dropped as much as 11 percent, while T-Mobile stock declined as much as 5 percent after the report.
The shares of both companies pared some of their losses after CNBC's David Faber reported Softbank, which controls Sprint, is not planning to withdraw from the deal as soon as Tuesday as some reports suggest, sources say.

 Sprint and T-Mobile are working to salvage their proposed merger, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing sources.
 Sprint shares jumped 5.3 percent in after-hours trading, while shares of T-Mobile rose 3.3 percent.
Last week, reports surfaced that SoftBank was planning to break off negotiations over disagreements on which side would control the combined company. SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, was reportedly hesitant to give up control of Sprint.
 But CNBC's David Faber reported that SoftBank was not preparing to give up just yet. The proposal from earlier this year was for a stock-for-stock deal that would give Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile's parent, control. 
The telecommunications companies could reach a deal within weeks, the WSJ said.

The first thing he does each day is check Twitter, writing tweets to his 4.7 million followers. ""I probably do 6 to 7 hours a day just on social,"" he told CNBC's ""The Brave Ones.""
 CEOs need to write their own tweets or risk being seen as phony, he added. ""You know one of the things you can't do in social is, it has to be you, if it ever becomes — and they can tell — if it's somebody being you, they vote you off the island.""

Stewart and Snoop have their own cookery show, ""Martha & Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party,"" currently airing on VH1, and in January posted a tweet asking Legere to appear on it.
Legere also told ""The Brave Ones"" he likes to use social media to show off to his family.

Pedestrians pass by a T-Mobile ad in the New York City subway.
 T-Mobile will still thrive on a stand-alone basis, according to a Wall Street firm.
 Talks between Sprint and T-Mobile over a possible merger have come to a halt, both companies announced Saturday. Deutsche Bank on Thursday raised its rating for T-Mobile shares to buy from hold, predicting the company will increase its dividend and stock buybacks.
""The 'new reality' of US Wireless includes maturing/slowing growth, and rising competition (both from T-Mobile/Sprint, as well as new Cable MVNOs). Amidst this backdrop, we think T-Mobile is best positioned,"" analyst Matthew Niknam wrote in the note to clients.
 ""Relative to service provider peers, we believe T-Mobile is a stand out given the combination of growth, profitability/FCF and accelerating shareholder returns.""
Niknam reaffirmed his $65 price target for T-Mobile shares, representing 16 percent upside from Wednesday's close.
The analyst said the company's current debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple is 2.6 times versus the company's target range of 3 times to 4 times. As a result, he believes T-Mobile can take on more debt enabling increased shareholder capital return.
""We see an increasing likelihood of buybacks/dividends in upcoming periods,"" he wrote. ""If we assume TMUS were to go to the low-end of its leverage target (3x), it could (theoretically) return 50% of its market cap in the form of shareholder returns by 2020.""
The company currently does not have a dividend, according to FactSet.
T-Mobile shares are underperforming the market so far this year. Its stock is down 2 percent year to date through Wednesday compared with the S&P 500's 16 percent return.

Magenta man
 T-Mobile U.S. Chief Executive John Legere is describing items in his office. “My T-Mobile Segway is amongst my top tools … My T-Mobile golf cart. I got a whole bunch of fun stuff … My ‘Yes Man’ … This is (Star Wars toy) Furbacca. He's just to scare people.”
CNBC had an inside tour of Legere’s office during filming for “The Brave Ones” and T-Mobile’s black and magenta-pink brand colors are everywhere, from a construction hat to Batman stickers. That include Legere himself, clad in a black tracksuit and pink high-top sneakers  — even his socks feature a picture of a Legere doll, a likeness of him with his swept-back dark hair. 
He’s far from your average suited-and-booted CEO and not only does he dress like one of his shop-floor staff members, he’s a Twitter and Facebook obsessive who schmoozes celebrities as well as deal-makers.
But for Legere (it’s pronounced “ledger”), wearing T-Mobile’s distinctive color palette is all part of a serious business strategy he introduced when he joined as CEO back in 2012 — and a way to stand out from much larger competitors AT&T and Verizon. “Magenta's cool. I mean, it scales. People like it. It's not like yellow, you know. And then we just overdid it. We took it to its extremes. And I think we've created a whole new brand around magenta,” he told “The Brave Ones.”

 Legere even claims that store staff love their uniforms: “One of the most satisfying moments you can witness any day at 8 p.m. in any city in America, which is, go watch the lights go out at a Verizon store. 
“Lights go out, the first thing those employees do is get out of those clothes as fast as they can. Watch a T-Mobile store close and out the door, dressed in as much magenta and T-Mobile as they can, are my employees. And if they change, it’s only to put more on. And that's brand and that's a big deal.”
Brand and marketing have been a large part of T-Mobile’s success since Legere came on board. “We were in a very difficult situation in the U.S. We needed nothing less but a marketing genius in order to turn the company around,” Rene Obermann, the former CEO of T-Mobile parent company Deutsche Telekom, who hired Legere, told “The Brave Ones.”
 “We were the fastest-shrinking wireless company in America. (We had) no iPhone at the time when everybody had the iPhone.” 
John Legere
 In 2011, T-Mobile made $20.6 billion in sales, but lost $4.3 billion overall. Legere described it as “a total mess” at the time. AT&T had tried to buy the company that year for $39 billion but failed, and Legere was hired to turn it around. 
“(For) a period of a couple of years, this company had been in waiting for a merger, which probably would’ve been the demise of T-Mobile's people and brand,” he told “The Brave Ones.”
“That merger didn't go through, but the company was declining. We were the fastest-shrinking wireless company in America. And we were also a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom, so not a public company. (We had) no iPhone at the time when everybody had the iPhone. Exactly zero people were covered with (high-speed wireless) LTE in America.”

 The challenge for Legere to start with was to shift the organization’s control away from legal and HR and towards employees — breaking the company’s old rules along the way. In his first three days in the job, he discovered that an Afghanistan veteran had been told not to display a platoon photograph on his desk in case it upset people who opposed the war, and that the company did not allow employees to have tattoos or facial piercings.
So he switched things around. “When I see something I disagree with, I ask why, and when I hear the answer, I ask why again. It’s a leadership technique you can learn from a five-year-old,” he wrote in Harvard Business Review in January.

Running man
 Legere was born in Fitchburg, Massachusetts in 1958, the middle child of five, and life was simple. “Dinner consisted of something in one pot. If you ever see me eat, you'll see that I eat really fast, because if you didn't, you didn’t get anything. My father had whatever money he had was in his pocket,” he told “The Brave Ones.”
He broke the rules from a young age. “I would sit in class and they would ask a question, and I knew the answer because I was pretty smart. But instead, I'd tell a joke and get myself in trouble.” 
Legere earned money making fries at a fast-food chain, running a ride at an amusement park, washing floors at a candy store, making plastic cowboy hats and peeling potatoes in a diner – the list goes on. Athletics was his real interest, so he put all his energy into running, which helped to give him his work ethic. “I always remembered coaches telling me: the harder the work, the harder you work, the more luck you'll probably have,” Legere said.
When it came to choosing a university, he turned down an offer from Harvard and picked the University of Massachusetts, based on its NCAA track and field ranking.

 Q:
Who's your role model?
 Click or tap for the answer
 A:
Truthfully, without being cliché: the reps and the front line (people) in the care centers.
 After graduating in 1980, Legere joined AT&T as an accountant and got an MBA in 1987 by taking night classes at Fairleigh Dickinson University. A master’s degree from MIT’s Sloan School of Management followed. But in the early years, he still had competitive athletics running in his blood. 
“I also went to the Program of Management Development at Harvard. But you know, most of that was later on. I still wanted to go to the Olympics instead,” he said.
Legere ran with the Olympic Torch in 1984, to mark AT&T’s sponsorship of the Games (that partnership is about to end after more than three decades, with Comcast taking over as telecommunications provider in 2018) and his exercise routine now includes his Peloton indoor bike. (“45 min on my Peloton, chicken in the oven for 45 min!! The delicious smell kept me going during the workout!!” Legere posted on his Facebook page in February, next to a selfie of himself in shorts.)
He ended up spending 18 years at AT&T, rising through the ranks of its accountancy program and running installation and maintenance in the Mountain States aged just 28. But he had little technical knowledge.
“I knew nothing. I remember leaning on a PBX (a type of telephone system) and asking the technician: ‘So you want to show me the switch?’ And he said: ‘Yes, sir. You're leaning on it.’ But you know, I learned to manage through other people. And then my first sales job was like a $400 million, $500 million unit,” he said.
 “But all of a sudden, I'm home, and it's the first time I ever had to think through the question:  ‘What do you do?’ I hated that question.” 
John Legere
 Eventually, he became president of the company’s Asia operations, before leaving for Dell in 1998 to run its Asia and EMEA regions. “I left AT&T because I realized that I had a lot more to give, and I wanted to break out of the big hierarchy,” he said.
The Dell role lasted a couple of years before Legere joined telecoms company Global Crossing in 2001 as CEO, taking it through a “really tough” restructuring and eventually selling it to CenturyLink (then Level 3) in 2011.
And then, for the first time in years, he was out of full-time employment. 
“I stopped being CEO and got divorced in the same month. I did well in the sale (of Global Crossing). But all of a sudden, I'm home, and it's the first time I ever had to think through the question:  ‘What do you do?’ I hated that question. And you know, I don’t know. I'm reading Eckhart Tolle’s (book), ‘The Power of Now,’ and I'm thinking, wow.
“My friends and my doctor said: ‘Dude, you’ve got to go back to work.’ I'm on (dating website) Match … but I did give some thought as to what I was going to do.”
Then a headhunter friend appraoched him with the T-Mobile opportunity. “She was a wonderful woman. So, yeah, I'll go. But the odds of me working for (parent company) Deutsche Telekom are, like, none, you know. I'm thinking, that's not going to happen.” 
But he went ahead and met the then Deutsche Telekom CEO Obermann. “Okay, here's the following, like, eight things,” Legere told him. “And if we can agree on these eight things, I'll come. But I'm really not that interested,” he said. 
His list included investing in better network coverage, doing a deal with Apple to be able to sell the iPhone to customers and merging with wireless carrier Metro PCS — all of which Deutsche Telekom agreed with.
On a holiday in Capri, Legere made a decision: he would take the job. “Because this has been, and still remains… it's so me and it's so core to what I was made to do. And to think that I even thought about it for more than two seconds is incredible.”

Manifesto man
 Back in his office during filming for CNBC’s “The Brave Ones,” Legere holds up a bright pink shirt. “When I was in the Philippines, in the call center, they gave me this shirt, which I have yet to find the right occasion to wear.” 
It is the call centers that gave Legere vital insights into T-Mobile’s operations when he took over from interim CEO Jim Alling in September 2012: he listened to the conversations his customer service teams were having.
 Q:
Any superstitions?
 Click or tap for the answer
 A:
Probably a ton. If I didn't have my Batman ring on, I would think something bad was going to happen
 “I got this resounding kind of feedback that people hated wireless. They hated the wireless companies. They would go to a store to buy a phone and they would come out with, like, all this stuff that they hated,” he told “The Brave Ones.”
“Nobody calls to say: ‘I love you.’ They call when they're so frustrated. And I heard the way that they were taking care of them. And it was a big part of me thinking that if I could get the whole company to behave that way and care about that customer so much, that we really could be different.”
 “Carriers locked customers into long contracts and treated them like crap. Their networks were terrible.”
John Legere
 So he wrote a manifesto. “We’re not like other wireless companies. Why would we be? They’re in the phone company business. We’re in the changing-the-phone-company business,” it started. Legere broke the rules by doing things like removing long-term contracts and global roaming charges, after an outburst at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2013 in which he snapped.
“I went on a rant. I said that if a Martian came to Earth and tried to understand the way the wireless industry works, he wouldn’t believe it—he’d go back to Mars,” he wrote in the Harvard Business Review in January. 
“Carriers locked customers into long contracts and treated them like crap. Their networks were terrible. ‘I saw more honesty on a Match.com ad than on AT&T’s coverage maps,’ I said.”
According to analyst Walter Piecyk, managing director at BTIG, initiatives such as scrapping contracts and paying termination fees to encourage people to switch from other networks are more than just gimmicks. 
“They are paying early termination fees in order to get customers to switch, and everyone followed, so if you look at the major changes that have occurred in the industry, from payment plans (to) turning off termination fees, no contracts, getting rid of roaming (charges), it’s a longer list of things that are precipitated by them doing it first,” he told CNBC by phone.
A major advantage for T-Mobile is that its core business is its wireless network, which protects it to a certain extent, Piecyk wrote in a blog post in September.
“T-Mobile is in an enviable position of building the bundle from scratch with services that consumers actually want and without having to sustain legacy businesses that are in structural decline.
“As a challenger, T-Mobile will continue to pick away at companies (including cable operators) that have to protect their high-margin, free cash-flow-generating businesses. We expect that free cash-flow to stunt the ability of these monopolists to respond, but more importantly, prevent them from making the structural changes to their businesses that would disrupt their entire business models,” he wrote. 
Those cable operators include Comcast, which announced wireless service Xfinity Mobile in April, although it said its aim isn’t to compete with the wireless carriers. “One thing we're looking at now is retention — it's key for us. It will be designed to support the core cable business,” said Comcast CEO Dave Watson at the time.

Social man
 Legere still visits his contact centers. “I listen to calls every week. I visit stores. And I have this massive social media that I do. So as I'm sitting there, I've got all this data (on customers), but if what I'm seeing doesn't match the data, what I'm hearing rules the day,” he told “The Brave Ones.”
He relies on social media for feedback to the extent that he’s on it all the time. “I probably do six to seven hours a day just on social,” he said.
“The benefit I have with social? There is no way that my peer CEOs are going to do this. There's absolutely no way. I sit at the restaurant, at the bar with my phone down, typing away. I lay in bed at night for two hours, an hour, and I wake up, and I'm hitting keys. 
“There's no way these country club-running guys (his competitors) are going to do it. Not to mention what comes in ... But it's a competitive advantage and I think it's worth billions. Billions.”
 Q:
What did you want to be when you were growing up?
 Click or tap for the answer
 A:
An Olympic athlete. And then, for a strange period, a podiatrist. I have no idea why.
 CNBC’s “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer calls him “a heroic figure in a landscape filled with people who are just part of a bland army,” while T-Mobile Executive Vice President of corporate services Dave Carey told “The Brave Ones”: “He can be charming on one hand and a raucous Las Vegas night club act on the other.”
Legere even has his own cooking show broadcast Sundays via Facebook Live, where he makes dishes in a slow-cooker, claiming more than 1 million viewers and featuring Legere-branded aprons, hats and pots. He counts rapper Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart among his followers. The pair — who have their own show “Martha & Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party” — have asked Legere to appear with them.
Legere is unafraid to sort out customers' queries himself. Among the comments on one of his Facebook posts (“You’ve got to be the best and the smartest CEO lol,” writes one. “Enjoying these new waves through the industry!” states another) is one from a disgruntled customer, to which he has replied with his personal email address.
 “I think investors care about one thing, which is making money.”
Walter Piecyk - managing director at BTIG
 Legere’s loud and proud nature also means he’s unafraid to send up competitors and calls them names in public. He told Cramer in April: “I've always told you that both dumb and dumber have been big contributors to the success of T-Mobile,” he said, referring to customers switching to his network from AT&T and Verizon.
He's also said that Sprint was ""once a legitimate rival, but it's become so weak that I usually feel bad kicking it when it's down."" Sprint and T-Mobile ended merger talks earlier this month.
But what do investors make of this out-there style? “I think investors care about one thing, which is making money,” according to Piecyk. 
“So if the management style is part of driving greater attention and customer growth and retention, and energizing the employee base, then there is no reason investors shouldn’t be anything but pleased with the results’,” he told CNBC by phone.
He praises Legere’s visible store visits and contact with staff. 
“Your visibility in understanding what the CEO was doing is very different than other companies where you have no visibility of what they are doing. You have no idea of whether they are actually visiting any of their own stores and energizing their own employee base … I think investors appreciate having the visibility into the thing that he’s doing to energize the employee base and to attract new customers, moving the overall company to profitability.”
For Legere, the future will be about market players converging (see the possible AT&T-Time Warner merger), but T-Mobile will keep on providing a ""monthly subscription to the internet."" And he's bullish about its prospects. ""Five years from now, T-Mobile will be easily the number-one wireless player in America. No question in my mind.""

35,2018-01-29,T-Mobile commits to 100 percent renewable electricity  ,"Getty Images
John Legere, CEO of T-Mobile.
 T-Mobile will move to 100 percent renewable electricity by the year 2021.
 The telecoms company said Monday that it had also finalized a contract for wind power from the Solomon Forks Wind Project in Kansas. Power generation there is due to begin at the beginning of 2019, and will supplement the energy T-Mobile receives from the Red Dirt Wind Power Project in Oklahoma.  John Legere, T-Mobile's president and CEO, said moving to renewable energy was the right thing to do and smart business. ""We expect to cut T-Mobile's energy costs by around $100 million in the next 15 years thanks to this move,"" he added.  T-Mobile has also joined the RE100, a group of global businesses committed to renewable power. Other members of the RE100 include Apple, Facebook and Google.  The RE100's head, Sam Kimmins, welcomed the news that T-Mobile was joining the initiative. ""It's great to see T-Mobile U.S. shifting to renewables for its power consumption,"" he said. ""As a large electricity consumer in the U.S., they can truly transform energy systems by bringing significant renewable capacity online — all of that while delivering real value to their customers.""
