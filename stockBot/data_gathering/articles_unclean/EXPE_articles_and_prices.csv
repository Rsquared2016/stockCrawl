Dara Khosrowshahi
 Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi ended the travel company's fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday with a remark that had some people doing a double take.
 When the CEO was asked for closing remarks, he responded by thanking the company's global employee base for the improved performance in 2016 and then added, ""Hopefully we will all be alive to see the end of next year.""
CNBC reached out to Expedia for comment. A spokesman responded, ""We do not have anything additional to share.""
 Still, Khosrowshahi's comment did result in several tweets, including one that called him a ""Trump critic.""

 Expedia CEO on earnings, travel industry   
 10:40  AM ET Fri, 28 April 2017 |  04:51 
 Timing was a major factor in Expedia's first-quarter earnings miss, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi told CNBC on Friday.
 ""The biggest issue there was Easter. ... Last year, Easter was in the first quarter. This year Easter is in the second quarter,"" he said on Squawk on the Street."" ""Stays came in lower, but it was purely due to a timing shift. When you look at the booking volume of the business, it's growing at very, very healthy levels and continues to accelerate.""
Expedia shares were dropping about 2 percent in midday trading on Friday.
 The online travel company reported, after the bell Thursday, first-quarter earnings of 5 cents per share, a penny shy of estimates. It did, however, beat expectations with $2.19 billion in revenue.
Expedia also reported gross bookings, a key metric, were up 14 percent year over year. But its marketing expenses also rose, up 22 percent year over year.
In addition to the Easter timing, Khosrowshahi said terrorism had a somewhat negative impact on travel. ""We saw London growth get a little bit weaker after the Westminster tragedy over there, but it seems to be coming back.""
The Expedia CEO said there have been ""spot disruptions"" among some of its partners as a result of President Donald Trump's travel ban, which has been put on hold by the courts.
In fact, ""the biggest issue that we see has to do with currency,"" he said, noting the weaker euro aided the amount of travel from the United States to Europe. ""The macro — which is more and more people are traveling, more people are coming online, and more people are using their phone to book travel — that remains a pretty significant tailwind for us.""
Khosrowshahi ended Expedia's fourth-quarter earnings call in February by saying, ""Hopefully we will all be alive to see the end of next year."" The company refused to elaborate at the time.
On Friday,  Khosrowshahi spoke about Trump's administration, telling CNBC, ""I think 100 days is early, you know. We took action, and we spoke when travel ... [felt] threatened and our travelers were thrown off by the travel ban, so we took a position there."" But he added, ""We want the U.S. to succeed. We want this president to succeed because he's the leader of our country.""
In January, the Iranian-American businessman, who once was a refugee, tweeted a New York Times story about Expedia supporting a lawsuit against the Trump immigration ban.

3,2017-05-24,The Philippines is experiencing the biggest growth in demand among SEA travelers: Expedia  ,"The Philippines is experiencing some of the largest volumes of increased demand from Southeast Asian travelers this summer, according to online travel platform Expedia.

Filipinos take pictures during sunset in Manila, the Philippines on April 26, 2017.
 Travel bookings to Cebu, famed for its white sandy beaches, for the June to August period this year increased by more than double compared to one year ago. Meanwhile, demand for travel to Manila and Kalibo rose by close to double on year, exclusive data from Expedia showed.
Reasons for the growth in travel demand to the Philippines are twofold, Expedia Asia CEO Jonty Neal told CNBC.
 From a supply perspective, travel destinations like Cebu have become more accessible for travelers in the region due to the increase in capacity of direct flights from low cost carriers, Neal said, citing budget airlines such as Cebu Pacific.
On the demand side of the equation, the travel preferences of millennials are taking hold.
""Millennials look for value and have a sense of adventure. They're stepping away from (the usual tourist hot-spots like) cities and beaches and going more regional,"" Neal said.

 Cheaper costs of travel have also contributed to the rise in travel demand to the Philippines. Airfares to Cebu have fallen by 50 percent while it now costs 30 percent cheaper to travel to Manila on year, data from Expedia showed.
This was due in part to the rise in low cost carriers and the weaker Philippine peso. The peso is 7 percent weaker against the dollar compared to a year ago. It hit a decade-year low earlier this year.
The growth in the popularity of the Philippines as a travel destination takes place against rising concerns over militant groups in the country. Members of the Abu Sayaff group clashed with police in Bohol, a popular resort island, last month. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte later declared martial law on Mindanao on May 24, 2017, in response to outbreaks of violence in the city of Marawi.
Still, the developments did not make a dent in Expedia's data, which tracked bookings made during the first quarter of 2017 for the June to August holiday period.
Neal also said he was was confident about the future of online travel for the region as a whole.
""There is stronger growth for online travel in Southeast Asia. There are a lot of options right on the doorstep (of Southeast Asian travelers)."" 
That growth fits into the wider of trend of the boom in online travel in the region — Asia is set to overtake the U.S. in digital travel sales this year.
Data from Expedia also reflected that the ten most popular destinations in Asia among Southeast Asian travelers remained crowd favorites, such as Hong Kong and Tokyo:
 Hong Kong Tokyo (Japan) Bangkok (Thailand) Denpasar (Indonesia) Singapore Taipei (Taiwan) Phuket (Thailand) Seoul (South Korea) Manila (The Philippines) Koh Samui (Thailand)

 That's exactly what happened to former Microsoft product manager and entrepreneur Rich Barton in the 1990s when he pitched beginning his own company outside Microsoft. 
But Gates had a different plan. Looking ahead at the risks Barton could face, Gates allowed him to bring his company idea to life within Microsoft. That start-up eventually became the billion-dollar online travel company Expedia.
 Gates possessed the one key characteristic that Barton says makes him, Jeff Bezos, Reed Hastings, Mark Zuckerberg and the late Steve Jobs the greatest kind of CEO: He's the company founder.

 Barton tells Ritholtz he focuses on CEOs who founded and still run the company. ""There are terrific professional management CEOs that come in later, there's no question,"" Barton tells Ritholtz. ""But a professional CEO never quite has the credibility of the founder.""
Gates, along with later-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, became Barton's first venture capitalists. Gates gave Barton a budget, the freedom to hire ""the most entrepreneurial people"" at the company to grow Expedia internally and the chance to make it its own company.
Unlike CEOs who later take over companies, founders ""have the license"" to make billion-dollar investment risks, Barton says.

Take Netflix for example, for which Barton sits on the board of directors.
Barton got dinner with Netflix founder and CEO Reed Hastings about 15 years ago, soon before the DVD-mailing service went public. Barton, one of the few web-savvy guys Hastings brought onto the board, thought the service was ""cool"" but saw no future in DVDs. Barton proclaimed it would die.
Yet, he recalls Hasting's confident, foreshadowing reply: ""We didn't name it 'DVD-by-mail-flix', Rich. We named it Netflix.""
""He is a visionary, long-term guy,"" Barton says. ""There are very few people who can do this.""

 Expedia filed the following memo with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 To:All Expedia EmployeesFrom:Barry Diller Re:DK Update As you probably know by now, Dara Khosrowshahi has been asked to lead Uber. Nothing has been yet finalized, but having extensively discussed this with Dara I believe it is his intention to accept. I also know the struggle he has been having out of both his abiding enthusiasm for Expedia's future as well as his loyalty to all of us. I know Dara would like to communicate now with all of you but I've asked him not to until this is fully resolved. If Dara does leave us, it will be to my great regret but also my blessing - he's devoted 12 great years to building this Company and if this is what he wants for his next adventure it will be with my best wishes. I say that because he deserves nothing less and I say that also because he will leave behind a tremendously talented corps of executives… We both will be back in touch very soon.  Sincerely,Barry Diller

Dara Khosrowshahi
 Uber's capacity to surprise has taken a turn for the better. On Sunday, the ride-hailing giant unexpectedly picked Expedia boss Dara Khosrowshahi to be its new chief executive, replacing ousted co-founder Travis Kalanick. He does not have the star power of General Electric Chairman Jeff Immelt, who pulled out of the running at the last minute. But he might be a superior choice.
The 48-year-old new boss is not much older than the entrepreneur he replaces. He is, though, much better placed to help the $68 billion startup go public. He was at the helm of Expedia when it was spun out of IAC 12 years ago. As such he knows both about the transition to public life, and about the demands of serving as a public-company boss.

Khosrowshahi boasts both tech and transport credentials, plus he knows how to keep shareholders happy. He led Expedia to deliver a roughly 760 percent total shareholder return as an independent listed company, Eikon data shows, or more than twice the return of the Nasdaq Composite index. That will be music to the ears of large investors like Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund that have staked their reputations investing uncharacteristically large sums with Uber.
SEE A CHART: Expedia delivered impressive total returns under Dara Khosrowshahi
The era of avoidable PR disasters could be over, too. Women represent half of the workforce at Expedia, and get paid the same as men in equivalent roles. Khosrowshahi's background — he is an Iranian-American, who moved to the United States as a child — bodes well for cultural sensitivity. He also seems well-liked by employees, with an impressive 93 percent approval rating on Glassdoor.
Of course, Expedia's market value of $22.6 billion mean it is barely one-third of the size of Uber based on the latter's last fund-raising. The ride-hailing firm has a still-fluid business model, unlike the travel company, which was profitable when it was hived off. And the new chief will have to carefully navigate relations not just with employees and upset shareholders, but with the unpredictable Kalanick himself, who still effectively rides shotgun.
Khosrowshahi is brave to take a front seat but the new CEO has a good chance of putting Uber on the right road.

Arianna Huffington recently spoke with CNBC about the importance of self-care.
 We still don't know if Dara Khosrowshahi will accept the job of Uber's boss — leading a company mired in human resources issues.  
If he does, the Iranian immigrant will walk into a company that's much less diverse than his current one, Expedia.
 Expedia, which includes brands like Hotels.com, Orbitz, Trivago, Travelocity, Hotwire and CarRentals.com, has been touting its efforts on pay parity and women in leadership for several years.
Expedia's U.S. workforce is 51 percent women and 49 percent men, according to data released in June of last year. That's compared to Uber's U.S. business, where 32.9 percent of workers are women, and 67.1 percent are men.
Neither company fares nearly as well when it comes to technology workers, but Expedia still has the lead.
Khosrowshahi's ability to build up a roster of women in leadership could become particularly critical to Uber, a company where sexual harassment allegations led to a scathing workplace culture investigation, and ultimately, a massive exodus of top employees. It's something that board members like Arianna Huffington have said Uber must fix urgently.

 To be sure, there are many different ways to measure progress in terms of diversity and inclusion — including the intersection of race and gender, the stratification of roles and policies like family leave. Even Google — a ""top company for women technologists""— has struggled to strike a balance when it comes to how much to emphasize gender equity in hiring and pay.
Khosrowshahi has very favorable reviews on anonymous employer review site Glassdoor, with a ""creme de la creme"" 93 percent approval rating. But on InHerSight, a similar, smaller platform that focuses on opportunities for women, Expedia doesn't have the same glowing reviews. One user wrote (edited): 
 The CEO Dara also made it a leadership-down sponsored initiative to try to promote more women to director level and higher roles ... which was great in theory, however, many male VPs still treat the company as a boys' club. A few examples of the boys' club: It was expected as a female that if my VP walked into the kitchen while I was in the kitchen that I would offer to step aside for him to get his coffee, because his time is more important than mine; or, offer to take his coffee mug and get his coffee and hand deliver it to where ever his next meeting would be. I also consider it a boys' club because in exec prep meetings they would often expect the females participating in the meeting to order and pick up dinner for the entire team while our male direct reports stayed to participate.  
Expedia was not immediately available to comment on that review.
Expedia subsidiary Egencia has admitted that the company still sees inclusion programs as in the ""early stages."" For instance, Melissa Hannigan, global director of talent acquisition for Egencia, said earlier this year that the company has been testing blind resume reviews and has been updating job postings.
""What we found is that many job adverts have a masculine bias to them. Words like 'manage' attract more male candidates whereas 'lead' attracts more females. Just like with blind resumes, we tested this across certain areas of the business and saw positive results and have now rolled it out company-wide,"" Hannigan said in a statement.

 });Ride-sharing company Uber has selected Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi as its new chief executive officer, just over two months after Uber CEO Travis Kalanick resigned.
 While Khosrowshahi currently has a 94 percent approval rating as one of the highest-rated CEOs on Glassdoor, the tech pioneer hasn't always felt confident in his ability to lead.
""Early on, I didn't know what I was getting into,"" Khosrowshahi says in a profile as a 2013 Ernst & Young (EY) Technology Entrepreneur of the Year. ""For the first year when I was running the company, I wasn't a particularly good CEO.""
 In the interview, he discusses the moment he gained confidence in his ability to effectively lead, bringing up the story of a young engineer who offered him some advice. ""Dara, you're telling us what to do, but you're not telling us where to go,"" he recalls in the EY interview.
""That really rung a bell for me,"" Khosrowshahi says, ""where I was just telling people what to do but I wasn't laying the vision of here's where we've got to go.""

 ""That really shifted my view of what a CEO has to do,"" Khosrowshahi says. ""A CEO of a multinational global company can't say what to do. You've got to plant the flag.""
Expedia began as entrepreneur and Glassdoor co-founder Rich Barton's internal project at Microsoft into the billion-dollar online travel company. Khosrowshahi was 34 years old when Expedia later spun off from its parent company IAC/InterActiveCorp, the New York Times reports.
Although he wasn't a part of Expedia's founding team, he says in a 2013 LinkedIn post that he felt lucky ""to be in the right place at the right time"" with taking over as the company's CEO.
For the future, Khosrowshahi would do well to take his own advice as Uber's CEO.  He writes that while at Expedia, the company has adopted a ""culture of celebrating failure"" because there is almost always ""another chance to get up and try again.""
""Taking big risks combined with having a team you believe in and that believes just as much in you as a leader make for long-term wins even in a game of inches,"" Khosrowshahi  writes.

 But Khosrowshahi has C-suite chops: He's been CEO of travel website Expedia since 2005, leading the company though brand expansions including Expedia.com, Hotels.com and Hotwire.
Now, Uber reportedly wants him to right the ride-sharing ship, replacing controversial co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick who left the company in June. In the top spot, Khosrowshahi will have a litany of issues to deal with, including a broken workplace culture, a legal battle with Google parent company Alphabet — and more.
 What's clear is the Iranian American business leader will have a challenge ahead of him. What's less well known to most is what Khosrowshahi is like as person and as a leader.
A dig back through his Twitter posts shines some light.

 Uber's new CEO has an inspiring message about immigration   
 5:29  PM ET Tue, 29 Aug 2017 |  00:41 
 Iranian-born Dara Khosrowshahi, who will soon become Uber's new CEO, did not hide his patriotism in a May conversation with CNBC's Jim Cramer.
 The Expedia CEO shed light on his personal experience as an immigrant to the United States on an episode of ""Mad Money.""
""I emigrated here when I was nine years old,"" Khosrowshahi said. ""My family had to flee Iran, ... the revolution, and we were very, very lucky to come to America and have opportunities presented to us. And that's ... one of the things that makes America great.""
 Khosrowshahi was a surprise choice to lead the embattled, privately-held ride-hailing company, coming in after HP Enterprise CEO Meg Whitman and former GE CEO Jeff Immelt dropped out of the running.
But  sources told CNBC that the board's ""dark horse"" candidate could be the perfect antidote to Uber's ousted CEO, Travis Kalanick.
""The power of immigration, the power of the American dream, if you think about the American dream, it is the best brand out there,"" Khosrowshahi told Cramer in May. ""It's stronger than Apple and Microsoft and Google combined, times 10.""

 So says Uber's new CEO pick, Dara Khosrowshahi, in a note he sent to his staff at Expedia, where he was CEO for more than a decade.
Of course he's scared. Who wouldn't be? Uber is one of the most fabled start-up stories of all time and, simultaneously, one of the most harrowing corporate unravelings. Replacing embattled founder Travis Kalanick to get Uber back on track is one big and terrifying task.
 What's notable is not that Khosrowshahi is scared, but that he admits his fear.
""I've been here at Expedia for so long that I've forgotten what life is like outside this place,"" he writes in the email obtained by Recode. ""But the times of greatest learning for me have been when I've been through big changes, or taken on new roles — you have to move out of your comfort zone and develop muscles that you didn't know you had.""

 Khosrowshahi also says the decision to make the move was ""one of the toughest"" of his life. 
 What Uber's new CEO pick is like as a leader (in 10 tweets)
 ""I've had the privilege to run Expedia for 12+ years now, and most of you who have been on this journey with me know it has not been easy going,"" he writes.
Indeed, Khosrowshahi passed on an opportunity to buy Booking.com in the early 2000s. Instead, his competitor, Priceline did. And Booking.com blew up. 
Such willingness to be vulnerable about your fears and missteps is the sign of a great leader.
In February, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg publicly apologized for mistakes his social media behemoth made in moderating content on the platform. His honesty was met with respect.
""I give an A+ to Zuckerberg for taking the time, and devoting the resources, to acknowledge a few of Facebook's blindspots — then do something about them,"" says Hal Gregersen, executive director of the MIT Leadership Center, in an interview with CNBC Make It at the time. ""Being uncomfortable and vulnerable, as his letter acknowledged yesterday, is one of the most powerful paths to creating inclusion.""

That willingness to be vulnerable takes courage and has helped both men build blockbuster companies.
And legendary Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz has also underscored the importance of being vulnerable as a leader. ""You have to be honest and authentic and not hide,"" he says in Harvard Business Review. ""I think the leader today has to demonstrate both transparency and vulnerability, and with that comes truthfulness and humility.""

 Expedia names CFO Mark Okerstrom as CEO   
 7:02  PM ET Wed, 30 Aug 2017 |  01:15 
 Expedia's chief financial officer will be promoted to CEO, the company said on Wednesday. 
 Mark Okerstrom will take over for Dara Khosrowshahi as president and CEO of the travel tech conglomerate. Khosrowshahi was recently named CEO of Uber. His job begins on Tuesday but Khosrowshahi will remain on Expedia's board. (Expedia owns CarRentals.com.)
""Prior to Dara leaving, Mark Okerstrom was his principal partner in operating the company — and therefore this transition is as natural as water flowing down a snow-packed mountain. There was no other candidate that the Board considered,"" Expedia Chairman Barry Diller, boss of IAC's media and tech business, said in a statement.  Khosrowshahi said Okerstrom  is ""a tireless, strategic, and steadfast leader."" 
 Okerstrom, already a familiar face for Wall Street, got a warm reception, as shares rose slightly after hours. He has an MBA from Harvard and cut his teeth at Bain & Company. He'll have to use those skills to keep a leg up on Priceline.
Priceline shares are up nearly 24 percent so far this year, while Expedia shares are up nearly 27 percent year-to-date.

14,2017-09-27,Cramer: Why Uber made the right call with its new CEO  Cramer: Why Uber made the right call with its new CEO  ,"After months of hearing about scandals at Uber and the privately-held company's very public search for a new CEO, CNBC's Jim Cramer finally found something to be pleased with.
 ""I spend a lot of time criticizing boards of directors for failing to fire chief executives who've so obviously done a poor job of creating value for their shareholders. That's why, when a company does something really right, I think they deserve praise,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""So let me break down why exactly I believe Uber made the right call when they hired Dara Khosrowshahi.""
The ride-hailing company hired Khosrowshahi, the former CEO of Expedia, after its co-founder and former CEO, Travis Kalanick, stepped down due to pressure from shareholders.
 Uber's search for Kalanick's replacement involved high-profile candidates such as HP's Meg Whitman and Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg, but looking back at Khosrowshahi's history at Expedia, Cramer insisted he was the right choice for the job.
""The two situations — Expedia 13 years ago and Uber right now — are more alike you than you think,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
In August 2005, IAC/InterActiveCorp, a large conglomerate of online businesses, spun off Expedia into a separate company. Khosrowshahi, then the chief financial officer of IAC, was appointed Expedia's new CEO.
In his 12 years, shares of Expedia climbed from $22.43 from the stock's first trading day to over $145 as of Wednesday's close, a 550 percent gain. Expedia's sales quadrupled while Khosrowshahi was CEO, from $2.1 billion in 2005 to $8.8 billion in 2016.
Cramer said the situation mirrors Uber's because back in 2005, online entities like Expedia and Priceline were still fairly new and on their way to transforming how consumers organized their travels.
Rather than physically visiting travel agents, people could book flights, find hotels and compare prices directly online.
""To put it into contemporary terms, Expedia and Priceline were the Uber and Lyft of the travel industry, and Khosrowshahi? Well, he played a major role in shepherding that transformation,"" Cramer said. ""When he took over at Expedia, the company had $15 billion in annual bookings; as of last year, [it had] $72 billion in bookings.""
And Khosrowshahi did not ignore that powerful secular trend. As Expedia's CEO, he orchestrated several strong acquisitions that contributed to his company's growth.
In 2013, Expedia bought a controlling stake in Trivago, a price comparison website that became a very high-growth asset for Expedia. Even though Trivago has since spun off to become an independent company, the deal still made sense for Expedia, Cramer said.
Expedia's $1.6 billion acquisition of Orbitz in February 2015 was even more of a game-changer for the company, and its $3.9 billion purchase of HomeAway in November 2015 put Expedia on a competitive playing field with the likes of privately-held rental giant Airbnb.
""Put it all together and Khosrowshahi did a lot of things at Expedia that he now can repeat at Uber. He built a company with tremendous scale that gives it a major leg up when dealing with hotels and rental car agencies and airlines,"" Cramer said.
The CEO also led Expedia through a difficult time. After the 2008 financial recession, travel lost popularity and Expedia came under pressure for several years before bouncing back.
But Cramer said Khosrowshahi's first months at Uber have been promising thus far. He's demonstrated a ""steadier hand"" than his feisty predecessor, issuing an apology to the people of London after the U.K. city revoked Uber's operating license.
""After months of flailing around, Uber finally made a great decision when they brought in Expedia's Dara Khosrowshahi to run the company,"" Cramer said. ""This unicorn still faces a lot of challenges — for starters, Khosrowshahi needs to figure out how Uber can turn a profit — but maybe, just maybe, when the company's ready to come public in a few years, it might actually be worth owning because this man's at the helm.""

 Expedia misses on top and bottom line   
 5:47  PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 |  01:02 
 Shares of Expedia dipped more than 7 percent in after hours trading after the company's third quarter 2017 earnings failed to meet expectations.
 This was the first earnings report for Expedia since Mark Overstrom took over as CEO, after Dara Khosrowshahi left to serve as the CEO of Uber.
The travel tech conglomerate reported earnings per share of $2.51 on $2.97 billion in revenue for the quarter, missing estimates of $2.62 earnings per share on $2.98 billion in revenue. Quarterly revenue was up 15 percent year-on-year, however.
 Expedia's bookings were light for the quarter. Gross bookings grew by about $2.1 billion, or 11 percent year-over-year to $22.2 billion total for the quarter.
The owner of Hotels.com, HomeAway and Orbtiz, Expedia faced a season challenged by extreme weather events. The company said it estimates a ""negative impact of approximately $15 million to $20 million from the recent natural disasters,"" referring to hurricanes that wreaked havoc in popular tourist and business travel destinations in recent months.
Homeaway, the vacation rentals marketplace, remained a growth engine for Expedia. It accounted for $305 million in revenue for the quarter representing a 45% increase year-over-year for the business.
Overall nights stayed through all Expedia lodgings brands, including Homeaway, increased just 16% year-over-year.
The number of properties available via Expedia's global lodgings business increased to 500,000 total as of the end of September. The company also reported that 1.5 million online listings were now available on HomeAway, a direct Airbnb challenger.
The company's executives have said they will focus on long-term opportunities for growth in international markets, and a more aggressive approach to marketing and technology.

 Expedia CEO responds to stock decline after earnings miss   
 10:53  AM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  03:53 
 Expedia CEO Mark Okerstrom told CNBC that the company's stock decline on Friday is a ""concern"" but he is still ""incredibly optimistic"" about the future of the business.
 Shares of the travel company fell Friday, one day after it reported quarterly earnings that failed to meet Wall Street's expectations.
The stock was down about 18 percent intraday, trading around $120 per share. The stock is down more than 5 percent over the last 12 months, according to FactSet.
 Expedia's bookings were light for the quarter, and it faced challenges from extreme weather.
Okerstrom said he believes investors are reacting to short-term issues, including recent hurricanes and struggles with hotel price comparison site Trivago. Expedia has a majority stake in that company.
""But when you put those aside, what we believe and what we see ... we see an incredible opportunity ahead of us,"" Okerstrom told ""Squawk on the Street"" on Friday. He said the company has been making investments in HomeAway as well as its core business.
""We've seen our ability to add new properties go from 30,000 about three years ago. This year, we'll add about 85,000. Next year, we're really going to ramp that up,"" he added.
The stock decline is a ""concern,"" Okerstrom said, ""but I'm not running a stock, I'm running a company.""
""When we look at the company ... we look at the strength that we are seeing right now in operations. We look at the size of the opportunity ahead of us. We look at the track record that we've displayed,"" Okerstrom said. ""We're incredibly optimistic for the future.""
