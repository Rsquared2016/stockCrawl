0,2017-09-11,"Buy Amazon, short Valeant among the top picks out of last year's Delivering Alpha  Film executives weigh the pros and cons of selling to Netflix versus Amazon  How companies are fighting threats from Amazon and digital disruption  ","David A. Grogan | CNBC
Bill Miller
 At last year's Delivering Alpha conference, Bill Miller of Miller Value Partners opened with a quote read by someone at a party honoring Marxist revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky decades after his death: ""Proof of Trotsky's farsightedness is that none of his predictions have come true yet.""
 One year later, some of Miller's predictions at that conference were successful, as were some picks by other prominent investors who spoke on the ""Best Ideas"" panels. But some ideas may need a bit longer to pan out.
Regardless, as this year's event draws near – on Sept. 12 – it's clear that the tips from investors during the conference are worth tracking. Returns on last year's picks are based on what the stocks and bonds did from Sept. 12, the day before last year's conference, through Sept. 8 of this year. The managers may have traded in and out of these positions since then.
 Robert Bishop of Impala Asset Management touted Teck Resources, a mining stock that's skyrocketed 43.5 percent over the last year. He said demand from China had been improving and that metals were largely in a supply/demand deficit, including copper, nickel and aluminum.
The gains were even higher before China Investment Corp. sold about half of its stake in Teck Resources on Sept. 5, sending shares down nearly 7 percent in Toronto. But the stock was certainly among the biggest winners of last year's picks.
Miller, who changed his firm's name earlier this year from LMM to Miller Value Partners, urged investors to go long the S&P 500, which is up 16 percent since then, and he recommended investors short the 10-year Treasury. Yields are about 40 basis points higher from the date before last year's conference.
Miller's best long pick was Amazon, which he said would grow 25 percent to 30 percent a year for the next three to five years. Shares of Amazon gained 27 percent over the last 12 months.
While the stock is down from its peak over the summer, Amazon has enjoyed quite the run-up over the last 12 months, fueled by investor hunger for growth and the company's seeming ability to turn any market it touches into gold.
Miller said at last year's conference that unlike Facebook and Google, which are each competing for the advertising market, Amazon is targeting the retail market, which is 10 times the size of the ad market. That gives the company a much larger total addressable market to tackle in the long run, he said.
Miller and Kynikos's Jim Chanos each took opposing bets on shares of the pharmaceutical company Valeant.
Miller was long, Chanos was short, and Chanos turned out to be correct. The stock plummeted 52 percent since last year's Delivering Alpha conference. If Miller is patient, this pick could still work. He said he was expecting Valeant to return 25 percent to 30 percent over the next five years. He still has four to go.
Most analysts say they believe Valeant's recovery -- following a scandal involving drug-price hikes, the use of specialty pharmacy Philidor Rx, a federal investigation, and a series of management changes -- still needs more time.
Chanos' record wasn't perfect, either. He urged investors to short Tesla, citing corporate-governance concerns about its merger with SolarCity, given that both companies were founded and led by Elon Musk. But the electric car maker's stock is up 77 percent over the year.
Chanos will be back again at this year's conference with some new ideas for the audience. Other investors presenting their ""Best Idea for Alpha "" include Leon Cooperman, the chairman of Omega Advisors; Jeffrey Smith, a chief executive officer of Starboard Value; and Mick McGuire, the founder of Marcato Capital Management.

 Netflix and Amazon are racing to expand their original video offerings, and most filmmakers, production houses and distributors say that it's creating new opportunities — and bringing in more money — for their movies. 
 While there are positives for both services, several independent film production houses and distributors told CNBC Netflix and Amazon have distinct advantages that make them a fit for some films more than others. Here's what they said: 
The case for Netflix
 Netflix pays more than other film distributors for movies, according to multiple film executives.  However many films will not be able to go to theaters.  Netflix's targeting abilities could help find more interested viewers for movies. But some say the audience wanes in about two weeks because there is so much content on the service.  
All the sources said Netflix pays more for distribution rights for films than its competitors. In return, most will have to forgo any additional revenue generated from being in theaters because most of Netflix's movies are on its platform only. The majority of filmmakers will probably make more money overall if they take the Netflix deal, barring the few films that become blockbuster hits, one production executive said.
But not every film will make its mark in theaters, the executive added. For example, an independent romantic comedy with no well-known actors would probably not last long in theaters nor would it get wide exposure. But that same film may have more exposure to a larger audience on Netflix.
In addition, Netflix's algorithms help target users based on taste and could theoretically get the film directly in front of interested viewers for weeks after it is release. But a couple of executives noted unless a film is a breakout hit, popularity usually wanes after about two weeks because of the volume of content being added to Netflix. Still because of Netflix's huge subscriber base, it could mean the movie gets more views than it would have if it only ran in theaters. 
The case for Amazon
 Amazon is more open to letting its films debut or run in movie theaters than Netflix, according to film executives.  The company currently has a better reputation for marketing movies that have awards buzz.  However Netflix is hiring independent film industry veterans to help with marketing efforts and is allowing more theatrical releases for films with award potential, though not before they debut on its platform.  
Amazon does consistently offer one thing that filmmakers want: A theatrical run. Although it may not make financial sense in some cases, most filmmakers want to see their films in theaters. 
Theatrical releases are especially important for films short-listed to win awards. Amazon currently has the most liberal policy and reputation for allowing theatrical releases, even allowing films to premiere in theaters before heading to its service, sources said. However Netflix is increasingly allowing critically-acclaimed films to have a limited theatrical release. 
To win Oscars and other awards, a film needs a strong marketing team and plan to get the movie in front of the right people. Currently, the general consensus is that Amazon knows how to run an Oscar marketing campaign, and will put the money behind worthy films. Last year it took home Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language film ""The Salesman,"" as well as Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor for ""Manchester by the Sea.""  Its film division is led by notable independent film industry veterans Ted Hope and Bob Berney.
One source noted that Netflix is still seen as more of a technology-first company, rather than a media company. An executive noted Netflix has a reputation for putting more marketing dollars behind its fully-owned properties, not those it purchased from other production companies. 
However Netflix has been hiring experienced film execs to convince production companies their films will have competitive distribution and marketing, including bringing former vice chairman Scott Stuber on board in March. It also garnered some Oscar nominations last year for ""13th"" and won the 2016 Best Documentary (Short Subject) for ""The White Helmets."" 
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. Netflix declined to comment.

 The specter of digital disruption has quickly become one of the most concerning issues for business leaders around the world. In 2015, less than one percent of executives believed digital disruption could have a transformative impact on their industry. Now, Airbnb is more valuable than Hilton, Tesla is more valuable than Ford, General Motors and BMW, and Amazon's takeover of Whole Foods just put tremendous pressure on competing grocery chains' stocks.
 These tangible examples have moved digital disruption from a secondary concern to a top-of-mind issue at the board level. According to new research from the Global Center for Digital Business Transformation, a joint IMD and Cisco initiative, more than three-quarters of executives now believe the impact of disruption on their industries will be ""major"" or ""transformative."" What a difference two years can make.
Which industries are most vulnerable?
 Executives who thought – or still think – they are safe from disruption will face a rude awakening. No industry is safe.
The media and entertainment industry is seeing the greatest disruption as the level of competition among industry incumbents intensifies thanks to inroads from Amazon, Facebook, Snapchat and Netflix.

 Moody's: Amazon is still a long way from dominating retail   
 4:11  PM ET Fri,  1 Sept 2017 |  01:55 
 Only slightly behind media are technology products and services, retail, financial services and telecommunications. The businesses in these markets share several characteristics that make them particularly exposed to digital disruption. For one, their core products and services are highly information-centric and can be readily digitized.
How can companies respond to the forces of disruption?
Despite the increased awareness about digital disruption, 40 percent of survey respondents still feel their leaders do not understand the threat, or are responding inappropriately. There is still a large gap between acknowledging the need to transform and actually achieving transformation.
When faced with a disruptive competitive threat, it can be hard to know what to do because you are on unfamiliar terrain. However, four distinct strategies can provide a framework to conceptualize your options.
1. Harvest
This is a defensive strategy designed to maximize gains from a declining business or market. Domino's has been employing this tactic by driving greater efficiencies through digital technologies. Despite strong performance through the 1990s, Domino's struggled in the early to mid 2000s. However, the company's leadership determined an online presence that was both user friendly and efficient could improve the customer experience and yield more sales. By 2015,  the company was processing approximately half of all orders online, sales were 30 percent more than in store purchases, and labor costs decreased due to efficiencies created by the technology.
2. Retreat
The Harvest strategy is about maximizing value in threatened segments. However, when the costs of maintaining a business clearly outstrip the benefits, companies should focus on strategic retreat. This strategy emphasizes withdrawal into a market niche that serves a small subset of existing customers with specialized needs. For example, when General Electric faced intense competition in its consumer appliances business,  it shed GE Capital's assets and sold its appliances division – exiting a business that brought in $19.6 billion in 2015, or nearly 17 percent of GE's total revenue. GE is now using the proceeds of these sales to focus on its  industrial internet strategy.
3. Disrupt
While Harvest and Retreat are defensive strategies, incumbents can go on the offensive and become disruptors themselves. When a market opportunity that can be profitably exploited is detected, companies should focus on creating new value for customers using digital technologies and business models.  Look no further than Otto for an example of a disruptive strategy. The company, which was recently acquired by UBER, disrupts the freight industry by automating trucking. Currently, labor represents 40 - 75 percent of operational costs for the industry. If Otto can completely automate its trucks, it will be able to offer its services at a drastically reduced price and cut out the competition.
4. Occupy
Although the disrupt strategy represents catalytic activities that introduce market disruption, the Occupy strategy focuses on sustaining the competitive gains associated with that disruption. Occupy rejects the ""build it and they will come"" approach, and is premised on the reality that the company that introduces a disruption may not end up winning in the end.  Walmart has employed this strategy to succeed in retail. Over the past few years, Walmart has invested billions in multi-channel capabilities to combat ecommerce competitors like Amazon. In executing this strategy, Walmart's stores become a key asset as nearly ninety percent of Americans live within ten miles of one.
The pace of disruption is accelerating across industries as a result of faster digital technology innovation cycles, an explosion of well-funded start-ups and the emergence of Chinese giants such as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu. Digital transformation requires action. Just talking about digital change, hiring a chief digital officer or starting an ""innovation hub"" won't save your business. A true, holistic change to your business model is needed to survive and thrive in the digital era. The time for strategic action is now – because no one knows what the next two years will bring.

 Whole Foods' foot traffic surges over 25 percent   
 10:50  AM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  00:45 
 Amazon buying Whole Foods and slashing prices on organic produce and pasta sauce, among other items, is reportedly bringing increased foot traffic to the grocery chain.
 Across the U.S., Whole Foods stores saw a spike of more than 25 percent in foot traffic on Aug. 28 and 29, the first Monday and Tuesday that the merger was complete and as discounts were starting to roll out, location intelligence company Foursquare told CNBC.
Bloomberg first reported the statistics on Monday.
 The volume of shoppers in stores was compared to the prior Monday and Tuesday, Aug. 21 and 22, Foursquare said, when Amazon had yet to announce its promised price cuts. The data were pulled from shoppers' mobile phones.
The products that shoppers have been most excited to see marked down at Whole Foods stores include avocados, bananas and various meats. A store check by CNBC on Aug. 28 found that some items had been discounted by more than 40 percent. And Amazon has promised ""more to come.""
According to Foursquare, New York Whole Foods locations saw a lower surge in foot traffic — only 15 percent — on the first two days post-acquisition. And Chicago supermarkets saw the highest growth in shoppers — 35 percent.
To be sure, time will tell if the numbers hold, as this is still early days of the Amazon-Whole Foods combination.
Amazon is readily looking for other ways to boost sales, such as by putting Whole Foods' private-label line, 365 Everyday Value, on Amazon.com.
According to One Click Retail, an e-commerce firm that has been tracking Amazon sales, the internet giant had more than 2,000 Whole Foods items on its website in the first week that it bought the grocery chain.
Through Amazon's Fresh, Prime Now and Prime Pantry platforms, the company saw $500,000 in sales on Whole Foods items in ""week one,"" One Click Retail found. Top sellers were coconut water, deli turkey breast and frozen fruits and vegetables, the firm added, based on its analysis.
A representative from Amazon didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for confirmation of these statistics.
As Amazon looks to lower the average shopper's ticket at Whole Foods, a war on prices is heating up among other players in the grocery industry.
A recent price survey at grocery stores by Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Gromm found that Wal-Mart is losing its competitive edge on discounting from players such as Target and AmazonFresh. Target just last week unveiled its plans to cut prices further.
Meantime, Kroger flaunted the success and opportunity in growing its private-label line on a recent call with analysts and investors, while German grocery players Lidl and Aldi remain in expansion mode. Everyone wants a piece of the pie.

 Could Boston be Amazon's second home?   
 12:46  PM ET Wed, 13 Sept 2017 |  00:55 
 Amazon is publicly seeking a home for its second headquarters, and a report from Bloomberg on Tuesday says some execs are already pushing for Boston. 
 The execs reportedly like that Boston is near prestigious schools like MIT and Harvard, which would no doubt help to fill its ranks with highly educated alums with different areas of expertise, whether engineering or the arts.
In CNBC's own analysis of where Amazon might put its new HQ, Boston was ranked fifth.
 The city is also near an airport, one of Amazon's other requirements, and along public transit. Boston has its own train line but is also close to Amtrak for easy access to the rest of the northeast seaboard.
This doesn't mean Boston is going to win out, but it sounds like some execs inside certainly hope that's where Amazon ends up.

 });Famed short seller Jim Chanos said Tuesday he was short on the grocery industry even before Amazon's $13.7 billion deal for Whole Foods. 
 In an appearance on CNBC's ""Halftime Report,"" Chanos said two German companies were already in the process of disrupting the industry before Jeff Bezos' Amazon showed up: ""Aldi and Lidl.""
""(They) should scare investors much more than Amazon,"" the founder and managing partner of Kynikos Associates said on ""Halftime Report"" at the 2017 Delivering Alpha conference, presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor.
 ""They are just disrupting the model for the East Coast and South on,"" Chanos added.
The grocery wars in the U.S. have heated up.
Lidl, one of the world's largest retailers, in mid-June opened its first 10 U.S. grocery stores in Virginia and the Carolinas.
Aldi, which tracks closely with Lidl, has recently said it plans to invest about $5 billion globally in its growth over the next five years.
Chanos said the grocery industry is a business with ""razor-thin margins"" and declining returns on capital. Amazon's deal with Whole Foods didn't help that any, he said.
""For an industry with tiny, tiny margins and then having Amazon show up with Whole Foods just was sort of the last straw,"" he said.

 Amazon came under fire in May when its newly released Echo Show looked almost identical to an existing voice-controlled video device made by Nucleus, a startup Amazon invested in through its Alexa Fund.
 Nucleus CEO Jonathan Frankel took to the press to show his frustration about getting copied by his own investor — a notion that Amazon shrugged off, saying the idea for the Echo Show came way before investing in Nucleus.
But in private, Amazon made a more concerted push to diffuse those concerns.
 After the Nucleus incident, Alexa Fund representatives called a handful of its portfolio companies to say a clear ""firewall"" exists between the Alexa Fund and Amazon's product development teams, CNBC has learned. The calls were meant to reinforce that the fund does not share information about portfolio companies with other parts of Amazon.
But it also was a reminder that the fund shouldn't be blamed if Amazon happens to come up with a competing product.
""It sounded like they were disarming themselves from liability in a way, saying they would have no idea if Amazon was working or not working on something competitive,"" said Carlos Herrera, CEO of PetNet, a startup backed by Alexa Fund.
Despite those efforts, Alexa Fund continues to sit in a tricky position. The fund, launched in 2015 with $100 million, works closely with other teams at Amazon, which could make it a double-edged sword for startups receiving money from it, according to more than a half dozen portfolio companies and investors we spoke with.
Like most corporate venture funds, Alexa Fund's main goal is not to maximize returns, but to serve in the best interest of its parent company — in this case, investing in startups that help expand Alexa's voice technology ecosystem. 
But to do so, Alexa Fund encourages its portfolio companies to work with other teams at Amazon for engineering, product, and marketing support, and requires a lot of information sharing. At least three portfolio companies said the product teams were directly involved in the funding process and their approval was needed to get the investment.
""I can't imagine there's no information sharing. That was part of the due diligence process,"" Herrera said.
In an email statement, Amazon told CNBC that the Alexa Fund has ""measures"" in place to ensure ""appropriate treatment"" of confidential information, and that Amazon independently designs and builds its own devices.
""We do not incorporate any Alexa Fund portfolio companies' confidential information into Amazon products,"" Amazon said in a statement. Amazon also said that Alexa Fund portfolio companies often ask for introductions to teams within Amazon, and any such information sharing is ""to help the companies with their Alexa integrations.""
 'They're like nuclear power'
 Alexa Fund is run by Paul Bernard, director of worldwide corporate development. Bernard works alongside a small group of partners for the fund, but the team has far-reaching connections within the company. Startups we spoke with said they worked with various teams within Amazon, including Amazon Web Services (Amazon's cloud division), Lab126 (Amazon's hardware lab), and the Dash team (which builds Dash buttons that make reorders easy).
The fund has mostly invested in very early stage startups so far, with an estimated average size of investment in the range of $250,000 to $500,000.
But after investing mostly in very early stage startups in its first two years, Alexa Fund has recently started to make bigger bets. In just the past three months, Alexa fund has announced participation in two major rounds: a $300 million Series B round in Essential, the new hardware startup from Android co-founder Andy Rubin; and a $50 million Series B round for TrackR, a device that users can attach to their keys to help find them when they're lost.
The fund currently has $57.5 million left in the bank, according to Pitchbook.
Given Amazon's massive reach in so many areas, it's always a possibility that Amazon could come out with a competing product. But most of the startups backed by Alexa Fund said the benefit of taking on a well-known investor with infinite resources far outweighs the risk of getting copied.
Ring CEO Jamie Siminoff said Amazon has been a great partner since investing in his smart doorbell startup last year. He said he works ""very closely"" with Amazon, but as CEO, it's his job to make sure he doesn't share any proprietary information that could potentially hurt his business.
""To say Amazon will not compete with you is lunacy because they compete with everybody,"" he said. ""They're like nuclear power. They are very, very powerful and you can get amazing, clean energy from them but there's also the possibility of getting human radiation if you're not careful."" 
Christian Smith, president of TrackR, a location tracking startup that just closed a $50 million round last month with participation from Alexa Fund, argued Amazon has always been clear about the information ""firewall."" Rather, he blamed the Nucleus team for failing to create a strong enough product that's hard to replicate.
 """"They're like nuclear power. They are very, very powerful and you can get amazing, clean energy from them but there's also the possibility of getting human radiation if you're not careful.""""
-Ring CEO Jamie Siminoff, on Amazon
 ""I view that as a business development failure on the Nucleus team's side,"" Smith said. ""We would welcome it if Amazon entered our space because the more players there are, the bigger the market is going to grow.""
Regarding Nucleus, Amazon told CNBC via email that the company had been working on Echo Show and Alexa calling and messaging for a long time, and that work ""was already well underway before we had our first discussion with Nucleus and was not influenced by those discussions.""
 Reputational harm
 Another issue is how other investors perceive the Alexa Fund. 
Rob Rueckert, who spent 15 years at Intel Capital before joining Sorenson Capital, believes the Echo Show has set a dangerous precedent that could undermine Alexa Fund's credibility and hurt its future prospects of finding new investment leads.
""Your reputation is most of what you have when you invest,"" said Rueckert, who has not invested in the same round as Alexa Fund before. ""If this becomes a pattern, then other investors won't even entertain [Alexa Fund], and Amazon will no longer have a fund that's reliable. It would be the death knell for that fund.""
One Nucleus investor, who declined to be named out of fear of retribution, said Amazon's failure to disclose its plan for a competing product with other co-investors in Nucleus seriously harms its reputation. He said every investor and entrepreneur should think twice about the potential conflict of interest stemming from information sharing at Amazon.
""If I see another deal in front of me, and if I see Alexa Fund is in there, that to me would be a non-starter in terms of looking at the deal,"" this investor said.
At Intel Capital, investors tried to be extra careful not to let trade secrets flow across the firewall into its parent company, Intel, in order to avoid a potential conflict, Rueckert said. If a portfolio company asked for help from Intel's business side, meetings were held separately to ensure no confidential information inadvertently got passed around, he said.
But given the ever-growing reach of Amazon, it's hard to completely rule out any kind of conflict, according to Arjun Sethi, a partner at Social Capital, who's invested in TrackR. He said his experience working with Alexa Fund has been ""very positive,"" although he pointed out every investor and entrepreneur need to be cognizant of the risk of working with them.
""A company always has to ask the question: Am I willing to take the risk of taking that capital from Amazon? It's incumbent upon investors and the companies to understand what that risk looks like,"" he said.

Amazon Fire TV
 Amazon has stopped selling the Fire TV amid rumors it's planning to introduce new devices. The dedicated landing page for the Fire TV says it's ""currently unavailable"" with no date of when it might be back in stock. You can still buy a refurbished one, however. The Fire TV is also no longer depicted in the carousel on the Fire TV page. So yeah, we're probably getting a new Fire TV very soon.
AFTVNews  leaked an image of two new Fire TV devices this past week. One of the rumored gadgets is a dongle that'll plug into an HDMI port and work like the Fire TV streaming stick. The second, flagship device will feature Alexa built-in. It's a cube. Both new models will reportedly support 4K and HDR content. The square dongle will be less powerful than the current top-of-the line Fire TV with 2GB of RAM, 8GB of internal storage, and a 1.5GHz processor. It might cost between $60 and $80.
The flagship Fire TV will feature the same buttons as an Echo Dot, including a mute button, action button, and volume controls. It'll also include a built-in IR blaster, so it'll be able to control older TVs that don't support the HDMI-CEC standard. It'll likely cost more than $100.
 Of course, now that the actual Fire TV listing is down, we have to think Amazon will announce these new gadgets sooner than later.

 When Amazon acquired Whole Foods last month, it bought more than a grocery business; it also purchased 400-plus stores that could serve as return points for Amazon orders.
Now, a startup called Happy Returns is building a nationwide network of return points inside malls and mom-and-pop stores in an attempt to give other e-commerce sites a similar footprint.
 The company has struck deals with several mall companies like Simon and Westfield to accept returns at existing Guest Services counters or to rent out space for a Happy Returns return desk in their shopping centers. The startup now has 40 return locations across 14 metro areas in the U.S. and is working on adding many more.

The end goal is to play matchmaker between online retailers and brick-and-mortar stores to benefit three constituencies: E-commerce sites, by reducing their return costs — Happy Returns charges them a per-order fee that's lower than the cost the site would pay to offer a free mailed-in return to its customer; malls and brick-and-mortar stores, by boosting their foot traffic; and online shoppers by giving them a way to get quick refunds without the need to print out a return label or find a box in which to ship an order back.
""We've been saying for two years, returns are an overlooked friction point in the e-commerce experience,"" co-founder and CEO David Sobie said. ""If you ask people what they want in returns, it's free, fast, easy and in-person.""
To help fund the expansion of their returns network, Happy Returns recently raised a $4 million Series A led by Upfront Ventures. The venture firm's partner Greg Bettinelli has joined the startup's board, as has Bonobos co-founder and former Trunk Club CEO Brian Spaly.
In addition to the 30 mall locations, Happy Returns has also partnered with 10 small brick-and-mortar shops that want extra foot traffic to their stores and which are not competitive with any of Happy Returns' e-commerce partners. This experiment may not work, as finding the right type of shop that is interested is time-consuming.
But if it does, this approach will help Happy Returns reduce costs as it scales its network; the startup does not pay these shops like it does with malls — the stores are simply interested in getting potential new customers into their shops. About one in four who are coming to return a package end up buying something from the shop.
Another challenge to the model is that Happy Returns relies on its e-commerce partners to market the return option to online shoppers. So far, most haven't built it into the return flow on their sites, making it harder for online shoppers to discover. But if Happy Returns continues to grow its network of return sites and truly does reduce return costs in the process, you'd expect more e-commerce partners to more prominently feature the option.

Devin Wenig, CEO, eBay
 As Amazon, Wal-Mart and Target work faster than ever to beef up their e-commerce operations, one of America's earlier internet marketplaces has fallen off some shoppers' radars.
 But don't count eBay out of the race to the top.
The company is partnering with Spring, a New York-based fashion e-retailer, to bring hundreds of big-name accessories and apparel brands to ebay.com.
 Shoppers will now be able to browse the looks of David Yurman, Rag & Bone, Mango and Chloe on eBay's website, the same site that lets customers bid on toys, power tools and motorcycles. Like its retail rival Amazon, eBay's in the business of everything.
EBay's latest move shows the e-retailer is still trying to grow its online marketplace and shed from its image any perception of poor quality or too much hassle. Today, more than 80 percent of merchandise sold on eBay is new, and nearly 90 percent of items bought on the website are purchased without a bidding component.
It also reflects a bigger shift in the industry. 
""The Spring and eBay partnership is evidence of a growing trend in which retailers are partnering — instead of competing — with other retailers,"" Jill Ramsey, vice president of merchandising at eBay, said.
""With Spring, we can bring even more coveted merchandise to our buyers, making it easier than ever to discover their own version of perfect.""
The Spring storefront on eBay's website will function like a boutique, the companies explained, where shoppers should be pleased to find more of their favorite brands in one place. At least that's the goal, as consumers today are faced with more options of places, both online and offline, to ring up purchases.
""Spring's mission is to bring top brands to consumers at a variety of tastes, style and prices,"" Spring CEO Alan Tisch said about his company.
""Our new partnership with eBay helps further this mission and expand our reach,"" Tisch added. ""Both Spring and eBay are committed to offering unparalleled selection across the best brands — including the newest, hottest styles, sold-out or hard-to-find merchandise, and great deals for every price and style.""
Founded in 2014 by Tisch, his brother, David, and Octavian Costache, Spring's selection of products from more than 1,500 brands online today includes those by Michael Kors, Coach and Urban Outfitters.
It's not the exclusivity factor that sets Spring apart from other retailers or online players — Coach and Michael Kors, for example, can be purchased via many outlets.
Spring, though, has managed to curate an assortment of hundreds of fashion-forward brands, all within one site, and now it hopes to bring that same concept to eBay, making the internet marketplace a ""dedicated destination"" for women looking for Bobbi Brown makeup or a pair of Tory Burch sandals.
And both eBay and Spring agree that the more than 300 fresh brands coming to ebay.com should likewise benefit from the partnership. It's something that's expected to put their logos in front of more faces, maybe in front of some shoppers who weren't in the market for those products before.
As eBay's Ramsey pointed out, the idea of a big company deciding to partner with a niche name in the retail space is nothing new.
Wal-Mart has been on its own acquisition spree, buying e-retailers Moosejaw, ModCloth, Jet.com, and most recently announcing plans to acquire Bonobos. While its smaller competitor, Target, was keeping quiet for a while, the company last month announced plans to acquire a transportation logistics company to help speed deliveries. Target is also partnering with smaller brands to roll out exclusive products in its stores and online.
On Tuesday, Target announced its latest collaboration, with a couple featured on the home renovation network, HGTV. Chip and Joanna Gaines will be designing Hearth & Hand, an exclusive line of home and lifestyle goods, for Target stores and Target.com.
Amazon has indicated a similar interest in working with retailers, such as Sears and Kohls, to either sell the retailers' brands on Amazon.com, or work to get more Amazon-branded merchandise, such as the Echo, into brick-and-mortar stores that the internet giant doesn't have.
 Tisch told CNBC that Spring will become more of a partner with eBay, and will help curate fashion catalogs for eBay customers ahead of the holidays. He added that in working with eBay, the two are sure to face more competition from Amazon in the market for apparel and accessories in the future.
But unlike Amazon, which has shown interest in rolling out its own private-label lines, Spring is sticking with growing its relationships with existing brand names.
On Wednesday, eBay's stock was climbing near 1 percent and is up almost 30 percent in 2017. The stock hit a fresh intraday high of $38.50.

 Analyst: Whole Foods will add millions of Prime members   
 10:53  AM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  00:50 
 Now that Amazon officially owns Whole Foods Market, one top Wall Street firm predicts the internet giant expanding into the physical grocery store market will boost its other businesses.
 Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating for Amazon shares, saying millions of Whole Foods shoppers will likely sign up for Amazon Prime.
Amazon's ""price cuts, Prime Now and other investment will pressure profitability, but we also see Whole Foods Market driving faster Prime sub growth,"" analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients Thursday.
 Nowak reaffirmed his $1,150 price target for Amazon, representing 15 percent upside from Wednesday's close.
The analyst estimated 38 percent of Whole Foods customers, or about 5 million households, are not Amazon Prime subscribers.
""We expect Amazon to convert half of these shoppers between now and the end of 2019,"" he wrote. ""We see AMZN's Prime member growth and engagement, Echo device sales, and consumer web traffic/interest driving solid top line trends and GMV [gross merchandise volume] per customer growth.""
Nowak also predicts Whole Foods sales will grow by 12 percent annually through 2022. It will reach 3.3 percent market share of the US grocery market during the next five years from an estimated 2.1 percent at year end 2017, according to the analyst.
""Growth will come from new shopper growth, which we see inflecting from more competitive pricing and increased convenience,"" Nowak said.
Amazon is crushing the market so far this year. Its shares have risen 33 percent year to date through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's 12 percent return.

 Barclays says it's ""time to take a fresh look"" at VMware.
 Analyst Raimo Lenschow upgraded the virtualization software company to overweight from equal weight, arguing that fears over cloud-based platforms are overblown. Especially in light of the company's partnership with e-commerce giant Amazon.
""The company faced questions about its long term prospects given the changing infrastructure landscape due to the shift to the public cloud,"" wrote Lenschow on Thursday. ""However, we now have a better understanding of how the cloud and VMware could potentially work together.""
 Even more importantly, VMware's partnership with Amazon Web Services ""changes everything,"" the analyst said.

 Amazon is skewing the whole country's retail sales data and likely behind last month's drop   
 3:57  PM ET Fri, 15 Sept 2017 |  00:57 
 The surprise drop in August retail sales is being blamed on Hurricane Harvey and Amazon.
 Retail sales fell 0.2 percent, but without autos, sales were actually up 0.2 percent in August. Some of the 1.6 percent decline in auto sales was blamed on Harvey.
But there was also a surprising dip in a category that rarely falls— online shopping. Nonstore retail sales, the bulk of which is internet shopping, fell 1.1 percent.
 ""One possible, at least logical, explanation is that the 1.8 percent rise in July non-store retail sales was boosted by the July 11 Amazon Prime Day, so the apparent ensuing weakness is a return to a more normal sales activity post the Prime Day sales,"" wrote Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies. He notes that nonstore sales were up 8 percent year over year even with the sharp August decline.
Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, also pointed to Amazon. He said details of July sales show that the sub category of internet shopping was up 2 percent, and probably the result of Amazon's self-proclaimed one-day shopping holiday.
Amazon has said its third annual Prime Day was its ""biggest day ever,"" with sales surpassing its 2016 Black Friday and Cyber Monday results. Prime Day sales grew by more than 60 percent from 2016.
Stanley also blamed Harvey for the drop in auto sales, which took a dip at the end of the month. Harvey also could have been partly to blame for some of the jump in gasoline sales, which were up 2.5 percent. Stanley said prices were already slightly higher in August ahead of the hurricane, which dumped unprecedented rainfall on the heart of the refining industry. 
Goldman Sachs economists, in a note, said Harvey likely added to sales declines in a number of discretionary categories—clothing, electronics and building materials.
Sales for September should also show the impact of Irma, which hit Florida on Sunday and caused the evacuation of coastal towns in Florida and other parts of the Southeast.
September could show more impact from storm preparations since residents had more time, ahead of Irma, which crashed through the Caribbean before slamming Florida. Harvey appeared fairly quickly, transforming rapidly from a tropical depression into a powerful hurricane. 
""In my numbers, I took half a percent off of consumer spending in Q3 and added it back in to Q4,"" Stanley said. ""I think that's broadly how I'm thinking about the hurricane effects. There will be ongoing impacts.""

Apples are displayed at a Whole Foods store in New York City, August 28, 2017.
 Amazon's price slashing has made Whole Foods' prices more competitive with, and in some cases cheaper than, rivals Ralphs and Sprouts in the greater Los Angeles area, according to JPMorgan analysts.
 Amazon wasted no time trying to scrub Whole Foods of its ""Whole Paycheck"" image. On its first day officially owning Whole Foods, Amazon cut prices on a number of items across the store.
JPMorgan's Ken Goldman and Thomas Palmer recently visited Whole Foods, Ralphs — which is a Kroger property — and Sprouts stores in the greater Los Angeles area to check prices and speak to store managers and employees about any changes being made. The LA market is the single largest one for all three retailers, Goldman and Palmer said in a note to investors Monday. 
 At each store, they compared prices on a number of natural and organic foods, as well as items Amazon advertised it had lowered prices on. 
For products on JPMorgan's natural-and-organics-focused shopping list, Ralphs is now 4 percent less expensive than Whole Foods, and Sprouts is now 5 percent less expensive, Goldman and Palmer wrote. Ralphs and Sprouts were about 11 percent less expensive on average than Whole Foods before Amazon acquired it. 
The change was even more pronounced on items Amazon advertised it had cut prices on. For those products, Ralphs is now 4 percent more expensive than Whole Foods; it used to be 20 percent less expensive. Sprouts is now 1.3 percent more expensive than Whole Foods; it used to be 24 percent less expensive.
However, the items Goldman and Palmer compared were heavily focused on natural and organic foods, they noted. Before Whole Foods' price cuts, JPMorgan found their conventional products were 20 percent more expensive than those at Kroger and Sprouts. 
Sprouts has said it's always committed to being competitively priced. Ralphs, meantime, offers customers an entire ""savings center"" for shoppers on its website. 
Goldman and Palmer wrote they did not notice promotional or merchandising changes at the Ralphs and Sprouts stores they visited.
""We would expect that over time, Whole Foods' competitors will likely have to lower prices on certain items, especially in produce; otherwise they will see their traffic under pressure,"" Goldman said in an email. 
JPMorgan's findings suggest Amazon's price cuts are having an effect at Whole Foods. News coverage of the changes buoyed their effectiveness, Goldman and Palmer wrote.
From their store visits, it does not appear Amazon has made many more cuts since the initial ones that were advertised on its first day officially owning Whole Foods. That did not surprise them. 
""Additional price cuts so soon after the first wave — and without accompanying press releases — would probably not have as much effect on customer traffic and purchase habits (which are the main purpose for price reductions),"" Goldman and Palmer wrote.
They ""don't really know"" when Amazon will cut prices again, Goldman said in an email. Amazon will likely want to do some diagnostics and testing first, he said, although the information isn't clear. 
Amazon has promised ""more to come"" in partnering with Whole Foods, adding that Prime members will eventually see integration with their loyalty program in stores. For now, Whole Foods has mainly marked down produce and items from its cost-conscious, private-label brand 365.  Whole Foods is also in the midst of rolling out 365-branded stores across the United States, which will give Amazon an expanded real estate footprint but on a smaller scale.
Whole Foods declined to comment.
Wall Street has hammered grocery stocks since Amazon announced in June it would acquire Whole Foods, wiping out billions in market value from grocery retailers. Kroger's shares have fallen 12.7 percent since the day before the announcement. Sprouts' stock price has tumbled 16.3 percent in the same time period.
 Correction:  For products on JPMorgan's natural-and-organics-focused shopping list, Sprouts is now 5 percent less expensive than Whole Foods. For items where Amazon advertised it had cut prices, Sprouts is now 1.3 percent more expensive than Whole Foods.

The new iPhone 8, iPhone X and iPhone 8S are displayed during an Apple special event at the Steve Jobs Theatre on the Apple Park campus on September 12, 2017 in Cupertino, California.
 Apple's smartwatch and iPhone announcements last week set off a wave of excitement among consumers and investors.
 But they also highlighted a harsh reality for start-ups — it's nearly impossible to compete with big brands in consumer electronics.
Those following in the footsteps of DJI, GoPro, Fitbit or Keurig are now finding it hard to raise funds beyond an early seed round. With well-funded companies like Juicero failing and Intel shutting down its wearables division, investors have cooled on consumer electronics in 2017.
 ""Investments in consumer hardware are down partly because some of the consumer and internet-of-things devices haven't really delivered,"" said Cyril Ebersweiler, a veteran hardware investor and general partner at SOSV. ""Other start-ups are doing well but taking longer to scale than most investors would like.""
At HAX, a hardware-focused accelerator funded by SOSV, a majority of start-ups in the latest batch are focused on anything but consumer devices, Ebersweiler said. Instead they are making niche health and medical devices, or industrial hardware like systems for use in logistics, farming and manufacturing.
The same thing was seen at Y Combinator, another prestigious accelerator, where hardware start-ups in the last batch included zero consumer electronics companies, but did include companies working on autonomous and unmanned aerial vehicle tech.
So which hardware companies are in a good position to raise venture capital these days? A midyear report from Osage Partners' Natasha Azar said: ""'Big swing' investments are on the rise in areas such as quantum computing ... edge processors, robotics and non-traditional computing.""
Ebersweiler said this could become a lasting cycle. When investors don't make big, follow-on investments in them, hardware start-ups won't go after the biggest opportunities in consumer markets. That's because it takes a lot of money to manufacture and market devices (let alone hire great tech talent) when you're up against Apple, Amazon and Google.

 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella could have worked at Amazon   
 4:08  PM ET Mon, 18 Sept 2017 |  01:02 
 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella could have gone down a very different career path. 
 Nadella has spent almost his entire career working up the ranks at Microsoft. But at one point, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos tried to get him to jump ship, according to a profile of Nadella in Fast Company.
""Early on, Jeff Bezos was trying to recruit him [to Amazon],"" North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a former Microsoft manager, told the magazine. ""It was my job to re-recruit him.""
 While Nadella was being groomed as Burgum's protege, then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer had different plans, Fast Company reports.  Ballmer reportedly wanted Nadella to run Microsoft search engine Bing.
""Steve was very clear,"" Nadella told Fast Company. ""He just said, 'Look, this is the most important challenge I have. I don't think this is maybe even a smart decision for you, but I want you to do it. Think wisely, and choose. And by the way, if you fail, there's no parachute. It's not like I'm going to come and rescue you and put you back into your old job.'""
Though Bing may not have the same glamour as Amazon, Nadella took the challenge — and it's lucky for Microsoft that he did. While Nadella's appointment as CEO was met with some skepticism, shares of Microsoft were trading at all-time high levels on Monday, dating to its IPO in March 1986.

 Amazon Web Services just made its biggest pricing change in years   
 4:05  PM ET Mon, 18 Sept 2017 |  01:00 
 Public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services on Monday said that on Oct. 2 it will start charging its customers by the second for use of its popular EC2 virtual slices of servers in its data centers.
 The move is historically significant. Since AWS became available in 2006, it has charged by the hour. Then, in 2013, Alphabet's Google, which had introduced its direct competitor to AWS a year earlier, said it would start charging by the minute, after a 10-minute minimum. Microsoft's Azure followed suit shortly thereafter.
Now Amazon is hitting back by becoming even more granular when it comes to making people pay only for the computing resources they use, with a one-minute minimum.
 The price change is only applicable for Linux virtual machines, AWS' chief evangelist, Jeff Barr, wrote in a blog post.
While the per-second pricing could mean companies will end up paying less money for certain workloads, the change might also lead companies to be more experimental with their use of EC2 instances for certain types of computing.
 Source: Amazon Web Services
Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services and Infrastructure.
 It's a classic Amazon move: lowering prices to gain market share.
Microsoft actually introduced one service that charges by the second earlier this year, but it's for working with containers — a newer technique that's not as widely used as virtual machines.
AWS fetched Amazon a $916 million operating margin on $4.1 billion in revenue in the second quarter of this year. In that quarter, Amazon had 30.3 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to Canalys. It has long been the market leader in the space.
Cutting prices is a common tactic Amazon uses to compete with Microsoft, Google and other cloud infrastructure providers. Other competitive methods include opening more data centers around the globe and introducing new services.
""How can you use it to improve your support for continuous integration? Can it change the way that you provision transient environments for your dev and test workloads? What about your analytics, batch processing, and 3D rendering?"" Barr suggested in his blog post.

 });SayKara CEO Harjinder Sandhu with two employees in the office.
 Karl Kaufmann, an emergency room physician at Washington's Valley Medical Center, spends a lot of time at the end of a shift doing administrative work, like typing words and checking boxes into electronic medical records. 
 But recently, he's been testing out a virtual medical scribe called SayKara. 
SayKara was developed by a group of former employees from companies like speech recognition giant Nuance and Amazon. The team is based in Seattle and is launching this week after several years quietly developing the technology and securing a $2.5 million seed round from local investment firm Madrona Venture Group. 
 ""I use SayKara in two ways, both to recap a patient visit and to incorporate the pertinent details of a patient interaction into the medical record,"" said Kaufmann. Similarly to Amazon Alexa, SayKara starts working when a physician says a hot word, like ""OK Kara"" or taps on the app that runs on iOS devices, including iPhone and iPad. 
Kaufmann was one of the first to try out SayKara, which aims to be an alternative to human scribes and existing dictation tools like Nuance's Dragon. The goal is to accurately transcribe audio to text, parse the information to make it structured, and insert it cleanly into an electronic health record. 
Voice is rapidly becoming big business in health care, as medical systems look for new ways to help doctors focus on the patient interaction, rather than the computer. Studies have shown that doctors today spend about a quarter of their time on the patient visit, with nearly half on desk work and charting in the electronic health record.

 Cramer: Google has more work to do to compete with Amazon's Alexa   
 10:40  AM ET Wed, 23 Aug 2017 |  02:16 
 As a result, hospitals are already tinkering with Amazon's voice technology Alexa. And businesses like Augmedix are leveraging Google's Glass hardware to offer electronic health record support with a remote scribe. 
But SayKara says it's taking a different approach. Unlike Amazon, it is narrowly focused on the health-care space. And unlike more established competitors like Augmedix, it doesn't rely on human transcribers, which are expensive and take months to train. 
SayKara CEO Harjinder Sandhu says the first inspiration for the technology was Amazon Alexa, but that the team realized early on it needed to focus on the needs of the medical sector to get it right. In order to sell to hospitals, SayKara needs to meet compliance, security and privacy requirements, and ensure that it doesn't make seemingly small mistakes that can actually have an enormous effect (a difference is ""hypo"" versus ""hyper""). 
""The hurdles in health care are very high,"" admits Sandhu. 
But Sandhu believes that the current technology is good enough for physicians to use. ""We're taking the state of the art in speech recognition and machine learning and we're applying it,"" he explained. ""The key is to couple it with deep knowledge of how physicians work and the information that is relevant to them."" 
The company hasn't figured out a price yet, but Sandhu maintains that it cost a fraction of a human scribe.
Ralph Pascualy, former CEO of Swedish Medical Group, is one of the first to sign up to use the tool. In his view, so much of his doctors' time is wasted in medical records that any company that can eat ""even halfway into the problem"" is worth the cost. He also appreciates SayKara's approach in not claiming to replace doctors, but to help them with specific challenges. 
""Unlike some AI tools, this company isn't attempting to boil the ocean,"" he said. ""I think physicians will be more comfortable with that.""

 Kohl's opens its doors to Amazon's returns   
 11:23  AM ET Tue, 19 Sept 2017 |  00:47 
 Amazon expanded its partnership with Kohl's on Tuesday with the launch of a new service that lets Amazon.com customers return their purchases through select Kohl's stores in the U.S.
 The partnership is the latest in Amazon's retail expansion efforts. The e-commerce company has been aggressively growing its physical presence in recent years, which now spans hundreds of Whole Foods stores to its own grocery pick-up spots and over 40 miniature pop-up stores located in the middle of shopping malls.
Here's a full list of Amazon's growing physical footprint:
 Whole Foods: With the acquisition of Whole Foods, Amazon now owns over 400 grocery stores nationwide. Bookstores: Amazon has opened 11 bookstores since 2015 and is scheduled to open two more soon. Amazon Go: Still in beta, Amazon Go is a completely cashier-less store that makes check-out free shopping possible. Pop-up stores: There are currently over 40 Amazon pop-up stores across the country, mainly designed to showcase its hardware products. Kohl's: Through its partnership with Kohl's, Amazon sells some of its hardware in-store and lets its online purchases make returns through select Kohl's shops. AmazonFresh pick-up spots: Amazon has only opened two locations in the Seattle area, but the pick-up spots could cause more people to try its Fresh service. Lockers: Amazon has pick-up lockers in thousands of retail stores, including select Whole Foods stores. College pick-ups spots: Dozens of schools have set up on-campus pick-up spots for Amazon deliveries. Trucks: Amazon runs a ""Treasure Truck"" in six U.S. cities that sell certain items at a discount. 
So why is Amazon so focused on growing its physical presence? 
One person familiar with the matter previously told CNBC that Amazon is seeing an uptick in online sales in the regions where it already has a physical outpost. While sales from each bookstore or pop-up store may not be incremental, they are fueling more purchases on the Amazon.com website. In fact, Amazon already sold about $500,000 worth of Whole Foods branded products online in the first week of making them available, according to Bloomberg.
But perhaps the bigger reason is to collect as much purchase data as possible and make better offers to its core Prime users. According to James Thomson, a former Amazon employee who now runs Buy Box Experts, Amazon's expansion into physical retail space will help gather more relevant data and learn more about specific shopping behavior. 
""As Amazon becomes relevant in more overall purchase decisions, it will be able to combine all of the search and purchase behavior to develop even more refined offerings and shopping experiences for Amazon customers,"" he said.

 As cities gear up to pitch themselves to house Amazon's second headquarters, Philadelphia is making sure Amazon knows it's serious.
The city sent a staffer to Seattle on Monday and are sending out others next week to ""to ensure we really understand the Amazon culture and what they're looking for in a new city/ culture,"" said a spokesperson for the City of Philadelphia. 
 Responses to Amazon's request for proposals are due October 19th and over a dozen cities across the country have said they are looking at submitting a bid.

 Amazon has stated a few preferences for the bids they are considering. The company is looking at metropolitan areas with more than one million people, with a stable and business friendly environment, urban or suburban locations that can attract talent and communities that ""think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options.""
The new campus is expected to employ as many as 50,000 people and cost over $5 billion to build and run.
In a previous statement the City of Philadelphia said they would provide Amazon ""with a perfectly located East Coast hub where they have access to a rapidly growing millennial talent pool,"" given the company's preference for a city with over 1 million people.
""We're also much more affordable than other nearby east coast cities with similar population sizes, they added.

 Retailers taking steps to avoid being Amazon roadkill   
 6:49  PM ET Tue, 19 Sept 2017 |  00:58 
 In the dog-eat-dog world that is the retail sector, CNBC's Jim Cramer says there's only one ground rule.
 ""Don't just stand there. Do something before the grim reaper comes to get you,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""That's how I feel about this amazing Kohl's-Amazon deal that allows you to return merchandise that you bought at Amazon to a Kohl's, which will box it and send it back to the online behemoth for free.""
Cramer has always liked Kohl's thanks to its reliability, conservative attitude and strategic locations. Strip malls are ideal for returning purchased items, he said. And because the Amazon deal will only go into effect at 82 Kohl's stores in Chicago and Los Angeles, Cramer figured the inevitable expansion to the East Coast would be welcome.
 The ""Mad Money"" host even recommended that investors consider buying the stock now given its 5 percent dividend yield, the promise of the deal and the retailer's strong balance sheet.
But Kohl's isn't the only company taking steps to avoid being crushed by Amazon. Cramer noticed Macy's introducing new fashions and upgrading its stores to avoid falling behind, an initiative he called ""a work in progress.""
Children's Place has also managed to stave off competition from Amazon. Cramer credited CEO Jane Elfers for recognizing that offering more sizes meant more business given how quickly children grow and how much easier it is for them to try clothes on rather than order them online.
Cramer also didn't want to write off Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, three discount retailers that have the capacity to sell goods at lower prices than they go for on Amazon.
The ""Mad Money"" host had a harder time defending food and drug retailers like Walgreens or CVS, however. He said Amazon's tie-up with Whole Foods positioned the e-commerce giant to ""crush"" the food industry.
Cramer also argued that Amazon could easily go into the prescription drug business, which is why he gave up on the stock of Walgreens for his charitable trust.
""Don't rule out the newfound alliances with Amazon or the more aggressive style of those we think are being left behind, including, by the way, Wal-Mart with its fast-growing Jet.com business,"" Cramer said. ""It's not over until the fat lady sings. Right now, I'm not hearing anything from her yet, that is, if there's ever going to be a song at all.""

 Amazon's online shopping algorithm can guide users to purchase potentially lethal bomb-making ingredients, according to an investigation by U.K. broadcaster Channel 4.
 The news organization said its investigations team had found that Amazon's algorithm guided users to the ""necessary chemical combinations"" by suggesting other ingredients that could be used to make explosives and incendiary devices. It found that ingredients that could be used to make such devices were suggested for purchase under the ""Frequently bought together"" section of Amazon's online marketplace.
For example, ""ingredients for black powder and thermite are grouped together under a 'Frequently bought together' section on listings for specific chemicals,"" Channel 4 News said on its website.
 The broadcaster also said it was able to create a ""shopping basket"" on Amazon with up to 45 kilograms of ingredients for black powder (also known as gunpowder) even though current U.K. rules limit an individual to only purchase 100 grams of black powder for private use without storage.
In addition, Channel 4 News said: ""On listings for some of these chemical components, Amazon's 'Customers who bought this item also bought' section also offered steel ball bearings, push button switches and battery connectors and cables.""
Amazon told CNBC in a statement that it adhered to selling guidelines and complied it U.K. laws but that it would review its website.
""All products sold on Amazon must adhere to our selling guidelines and we only sell products that comply with U.K. laws.""
""In light of recent events, we are reviewing our website to ensure that all these products are presented in an appropriate manner. We also continue to work closely with police and law enforcement agencies when circumstances arise where we can assist their investigations.""

Televisions in a Best Buy at Columbus Circle in New York, Sept. 18, 2017.
 While running errands the other day, I ducked into a local Best Buy to pick up a pair of new headphones. What I saw inside was shocking.
Happy-looking people were huddled around tables filled with the latest gadgets from Microsoft and Apple. The video game aisle was bustling. Blue-shirted employees were helping a customer pick from a glowing wall of flat-screen TVs. There was a line — a line! — at the checkout counter.
Many people, myself included, assumed that the entire big-box retail sector would eventually fall under Amazon's steamroller. I knew Best Buy had spent the past several years playing defense against Amazon, finding some  initial success by cutting costs and reducing prices to match its online rivals.
 More from New York Times:   And this year, the Emmy goes to … politics   In Geneva, 'Dirty Money' of another kind — flushed down the toilet   Richemont opens an innovation lab in Switzerland
But Best Buy's rebound has been surprisingly durable. Revenue figures have beaten Wall Street's expectations in six of the last seven quarters. The company's stock price has risen more than 50 percent in the past year. Workers are happy. And judging from several other visits I paid to Best Buy stores, the chain appears to have avoided the bleak fate of other big-box retailers.
How do they do it?
To find out, I called Hubert Joly, Best Buy's chief executive.
An upbeat Frenchman who spent more than a decade at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Mr. Joly, 58, explained that Best Buy's turnaround was years in the making, and that it involved reshaping nearly every piece of the business. It's a fascinating playbook for companies hoping to survive in the Amazon age.
Here are the keys to Best Buy's turnaround, according to Mr. Joly:
 1. Price, price, price
 When Mr. Joly took over in 2012, Best Buy was bleeding out. A former chief had  resigned after admitting to an improper romantic relationship with an employee. The company's systems were outdated and many stores were losing money. Many of the products that drew customers to stores, such as new CD and DVD releases, were becoming obsolete.
The most worrisome trend in big-box retail was ""showrooming"" — customers were testing new products in stores before buying them for less money online from another retailer. To combat showrooming and persuade customers to complete their purchases at Best Buy, Mr. Joly announced a price-matching guarantee.
""Until I match Amazon's prices, the customers are ours to lose,"" Mr. Joly said.
Price-matching costs Best Buy real money, but it also gives customers a reason to stay in the store, and avoids handing business to competitors.
 2. Focus on humans
 Mr. Joly also realized that if Best Buy was going to compete with Amazon, which has spent billions building a speedy delivery system and plans to use drones to become even more efficient, it needed to get better at things that robots can't do well — namely, customer service.
In his first months on the job, Mr. Joly visited Best Buy stores near the company's Minnesota headquarters to ask rank-and-file employees about the struggles they encountered. (Among their gripes: an internal search engine that was returning bad data about which items were in stock.)
Best Buy fixed the search engine. It also restored a much-loved employee discount that had been suspended and embarked on an ambitious program to retrain its employees so they could answer questions about entirely new categories of electronics, such as virtual reality headsets and smart home appliances.
""The associates in our stores are much more engaged now, much more proficient,"" Mr. Joly said.
Customers had always loved Best Buy's Geek Squad, its army of specially trained tech support experts who could be hired to mount TVs and install other appliances at a customer's home. But sometimes, people needed help before they bought big and expensive gadgets. So it started an adviser program that allows customers to get free in-home consultations about what product they should buy, and how it should be installed. The service started as a pilot program last year and is now being rolled out nationwide.
Best Buy has ""really come through the valley by making investments around the customer experience,"" said Peter Keith, a retail analyst with Piper Jaffray.
 3. Turn brick-and-mortar into showcase-and-ship
 When Mr. Joly arrived at Best Buy, the company's online ordering system was completely divorced from its stores. If a customer placed an order on the website, it would ship from a central warehouse. If that warehouse didn't have the item in stock, the customer was out of luck.
Mr. Joly realized that with some minor changes, each of Best Buy's 1,000-plus big-box stores could ship packages to customers, serving as a mini warehouse for its surrounding area. Now, when a customer orders a product on Best Buy's website, the item is sent from the location that can deliver it the fastest — a store down the street, perhaps, or a warehouse five states away. It was a small, subtle change, but it allowed Best Buy to improve its shipping times, and made immediate gratification possible for customers. Now, roughly 40 percent of Best Buy's online orders are either shipped or picked up from a store.
Best Buy also struck deals with large electronics companies like Samsung, Apple and Microsoft to feature their products in branded areas within the store. Now, rather than jamming these companies' products next to one another on shelves, Best Buy allows them to set up their own dedicated kiosks. (Apple's area inside a Best Buy, for example, has the same sleek wooden tables and minimalist design as an Apple Store.) It's a concept borrowed from department stores, and it's created a lucrative new revenue stream. Even Amazon has set up kiosks in Best Buy stores to show off its voice-activated Alexa gadgets.
Granted, Best Buy has a last-man-standing advantage in these partnership deals. Many of its big-box rivals (Circuit City, Radio Shack, HH Gregg) have gone bankrupt or shut down completely. Which means that if Samsung wants to show off its newest line of tablets in a big-box electronics store, it has basically one choice.
 4. Cut costs quietly
 Almost every business turnaround plan includes cutting costs. Under Mr. Joly, Best Buy has used the scalpel as quietly as possible, gradually letting leases expire for unprofitable stores and consolidating its overseas divisions. He trimmed a layer of middle managers in 2014, and  reassignedroughly 400 Geek Squad employees within the company. But he has never announced a huge, public round of layoffs, which can crater employee morale and create a sinking-ship vibe.
""Taking people out is the last resort,"" Mr. Joly said in 2015. ""Because you need to capture the hearts and minds of the employees.""
Best Buy has also found more creative penny-pinching methods. Once, the company noticed that an unusually high number of flat-screen TVs were being dropped in its warehouses. It revamped the handling process, reducing the number of times TVs were picked up by a clamp lift and adding new carts to prevent TV boxes from falling over. The changes resulted in less broken inventory and bigger profits.
 5. Get lucky, stay humble and don't tempt fate
 Mr. Joly didn't explicitly tell me this, but it is obvious: Best Buy has benefited from some serious good fortune.
It's lucky that the products it specializes in selling, like big-screen TVs and high-end audio equipment, are big-ticket items that many customers still feel uncomfortable buying sight unseen from a website. It's lucky that several large competitors have gone out of business, shrinking its list of rivals. And it's lucky that the vendors who make the products it sells, like Apple and Samsung, have kept churning out expensive blockbuster gadgets.
""They're at the mercy of the product cycles,"" said Stephen Baker, a tech industry analyst at NPD Group. ""If people stop buying PCs or they don't care about big-screen TVs anymore, they have a challenge.""
Mr. Joly knows that despite Best Buy's recent momentum, it's not out of the woods yet. To succeed over the long term, it will need to do more than cut costs and match prices. Walmart, another big-box behemoth, is  investing billions of dollars in a  digital expansion with the acquisition of e-commerce companies like Jet and Bonobos, and could prove to be a fierce rival. Amazon has been expanding into brick-and-mortar retail with its acquisition of Whole Foods, and is moving into Best Buy's  home installation and services market.
Mr. Joly is optimistic about Best Buy's chances against these Goliaths, but he's not ready to celebrate yet.
""Once you've had a near-death experience,"" he said, ""arrogance, if you had it in your bones, has disappeared forever.""

 Amazon announces new $150  tablet with Alexa   
 11:22  AM ET Tue, 19 Sept 2017 |  00:52 
 Amazon announced an inexpensive new Fire HD 10 tablet on Tuesday.
 It costs just $150 and offers solid improvements over the previous generation Fire HD 10. It's not as advanced as more expensive tablets, like the iPad, but has some compelling new features, including longer battery life (up to 10 hours) and faster performance for gaming and watching movies.
One new function is ""hands-free"" Alexa, which means you can call up Alexa without opening a separate application. You can use Alexa for any purpose you might typically use the personal assistant on an Amazon Echo, including controlling your house or checking the weather. Amazon says this feature will hit in a software update on Oct. 11.
 Amazon
 The tablet has a sharp 1080p display but only 32GB of storage on the base model, which isn't a lot if you're planning on downloading a lot of movies. There's a microSD card slot for adding more storage, or you can opt for the slightly more expensive 64GB Fire HD 10.
Preorders for the new Fire HD 10 begin on Tuesday.

 });Last week, Hillary Clinton released her new book, ""What Happened,"" a first-person tell-all that documents her surprising loss to Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential election.
 Now the book is ranked No. 1. on Amazon's Best Sellers list and has already sold more than 300,000 copies in Amazon e-book, hardback and audio CD form, according to The Associated Press. Hardcover sales were the highest opening of all nonfiction releases in five years, the AP says.
The book is beating out New England Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady's ""The TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance,"" which comes in at No. 2, as well as two novels from 1986: Margaret Atwood's dystopian classic, ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" and Stephen King's horror classic, ""It: A Novel."" 
 Both ""Handmaid's Tale"" and ""It"" are seeing spikes in popularity after being once again adapted for the screen. ""Handmaid's Tale"" reemerged, via the streaming service Hulu, as an award-winning TV series. And, according to IMDB, the 2017 cinematic remake of ""It,"" now in theaters, has grossed more than $189 million worldwide.
Clinton's is not the only political memoir at the top of the list. Hovering around No. 10 is NBC News correspondent Katy Tur's ""Unbelievable: My Front-Row Seat to the Craziest Campaign in American History,"" in which Tur chronicles more than a year of traveling along with Trump on the 2016 presidential campaign. That memoir is also the No. 1 best seller in the category of Humor and Entertainment.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signs copies of her new book 'What Happened' during an event at a Barnes & Noble bookstore, Sept. 12, 2017, in New York City.
 ""What Happened"" is currently selling as an e-book for $14.99, in hardback for $17.99 and on audio for $25.99.
In different formats, it holds all three top slots in the Politics & Social Sciences category. The book also tops the Barnes & Nobles Bestseller nonfiction list, selling for $17.99. 
In the wide-ranging book, Clinton reflects on her uniform, the pantsuit, her ""dumb mistakes"" and regrets, and the time she reached out to NASA as a child and was told little girls couldn't grow up to be astronauts. 
She also looks back on advice given to her by successful leaders in various fields. At one point, she mentions that President Barack Obama, concerned that she might burn out, advised her to ""work smart, not just hard."" He told Clinton to make sure to pace herself.

 She also recalls an early, ominous conversation with her friend, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, during which Sandberg warned Clinton that the candidate should be prepared to face brutal criticism not only from her political opponent, but also from the country at large: ""They will have no empathy for you,"" Sandberg reportedly told her. 
Indeed, Clinton's book, like the reception of Clinton herself on the campaign trail, has been polarizing. The President himself weighed in. The day after the ""What Happened"" debut, Trump taunted Clinton on Twitter about her election loss:
""Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!""
 TWEET
 In response, Clinton offered Trump a copy of her 1995 children's book, ""It Takes a Village.""
""If you didn't like that book, try this one — some good lessons in here about working together to solve problems,"" she wrote. ""Happy to send a copy.""

 Kohl's opens its doors to Amazon's returns   
 11:23  AM ET Tue, 19 Sept 2017 |  00:47 
 Amazon is growing its partnership with department store chain Kohl's.
 Earlier this summer, the two companies announced that Kohl's would begin selling Amazon devices, such as the Echo and Fire tablets, at 10 of its stores.
On Tuesday, Kohl's said it will begin accepting Amazon.com returns at certain U.S. locations. The retailer will pack and ship eligible items — back to an Amazon fulfillment center — for free.
 ""This is a great example of how Kohl's and Amazon are leveraging each other's strengths – the power of Kohl's store portfolio and omnichannel capabilities combined with the power of Amazon's reach and loyal customer base,"" said Richard Schepp, Kohl's chief administrative officer.
As an added bonus, customers visiting Kohl's for Amazon returns can use ""designated parking spots"" near store entrances. In this partnership, ""convenience"" for consumers is key, Kohl's has said.
Kohl's shares were up 2.7 percent midmorning Tuesday.
Starting next month, the Amazon return service will be available at 82 Kohl's stores across Los Angeles and Chicago. Kohl's hasn't said when the service will expand to other markets, but this looks to be just the beginning of Amazon using retailers' real estate to its advantage.
In acquiring supermarket chain Whole Foods, Amazon has launched a similar service, where shoppers can return purchases made on Amazon.com at the grocer's more than 400 stores.
Notably, for Kohl's this deal could lure consumers into stores to make a return, where they might later shop. And falling foot traffic has become a threatening trend for many retailers this year.
""The test ... is an intelligent way for Kohl's to: (a) leverage unutilized parts of its store footprint and (b) help improve frequency (and potentially drive sales higher) in its stores,"" Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom wrote in a note to clients.
""All told, we like the moves Kohl's is taking as it continue to think outside the box and forward think on how to evolve in today's quickly changing backdrop,"" Haskett added.
Sears marks another retailer that recently signed a deal with Amazon, aiming to sell more of its appliances, and those with Alexa capabilities, through the internet giant's platform.

 Amazon is taking on the drug supply chain, says report   
 12:53  PM ET Thu, 21 Sept 2017 |  00:51 
 Amazon is ramping up conversations with a group of drug middlemen known as pharmacy benefits managers or PBMs, according to analysts from Leerink Partners. PBMs are a critical part of the drug supply chain, as they negotiate prices with drug manufacturers on one end, and manage pharmacy benefits for insurers on the other.
 The report, which was previously spotted by Axios, also outlines the ""disruptive"" potential posed by Amazon across the multibillion dollar pharmacy benefits and pharmacy arena. 
Citing an anonymous analyst, the report states that Amazon may ""indeed be in conversations with some middle-market PBMs now, in an effort to get into various contract arrangements."" 
 That suggests that Amazon is a ""bigger threat"" than many expect, but that it won't be right away. Leerink estimates that it will take about 18 to 24 months for Amazon to get pharmacy licenses in all 50 states. 
CNBC reported in May that Amazon was looking to hire a general manager to lead its pharmacy business. And that it had already hired Mark Lyons from Premera Blue Cross, a local insurer, who was tasked with building an internal PBM.
In the ensuing months, analysts and investors asked players across the supply chain were asked about the Amazon threats. Some described Amazon has a potential partner, while others were skeptical that the e-commerce company would move into a highly-regulated space.

A shopper viewing an amazon.com webpage
 Amazon said on Wednesday that it was reviewing its website after a British television report said the online retail giant’s algorithms were automatically suggesting bomb-making ingredients that were “Frequently bought together.”
The news is particularly timely in Britain, where the authorities are investigating a terrorist attack last week on London’s Underground subway system. The attack involved a crude explosive in a bucket inside a plastic bag, and detonated on a train during the morning rush.
The news report is the latest example of a technology company drawing criticism for an apparently faulty algorithm. Google and Facebook have come under fire for allowing advertisers to direct ads to users who searched for, or expressed interest in, racist sentiments and hate speech. Growing awareness of these automated systems has been accompanied by calls for tech firms to take more responsibility for the contents on their sites.
 Amazon customers buying products that were innocent enough on their own, like cooking ingredients, received “Frequently bought together” prompts for other items that would help them produce explosives, according to the Channel 4 News.
Although many of the ingredients mentioned by Channel 4 News are not illegal on their own, the report said there had been successful prosecutions in Britain against individuals who bought chemicals and components that can produce explosives.
Amazon said in a statement that all the products sold on its website “must adhere to our selling guidelines and we only sell products that comply with U.K. laws.”
“In light of recent events, we are reviewing our website to ensure that all these products are presented in an appropriate manner,” the statement continued. “We also continue to work closely with police and law enforcement agencies when circumstances arise where we can assist their investigations.”
The company declined to comment further.
Other tech companies have been in the spotlight for the algorithms that fuel their websites.
ProPublica, a nonprofit news outlet, revealed last week that Facebook had enabled advertisers to seek out self-described “Jew haters” and other anti-Semitic topics. In response, Facebook said it would restrict how advertisers targeted their audiences.
Buzzfeed also reported on how Google allowed the sale of ads tied to racist and bigoted keywords, automatically suggesting more offensive terms. Google said it would work harder to halt the offensive ads.
Facebook has also come under scrutiny for potentially being used to influence people during the American presidential election last year. It disclosed this month that fake accounts based in Russia had purchased more than $100,000 worth of ads on divisive issues in the lead up to the vote.
Last week’s attack at Parsons Green train station was the fifth terrorist attack in Britain in a matter of months. Several people have been arrested in the investigation of the explosion, in which dozens of people were wounded.

 });Amazon is working on its first wearable device: a pair of ""smart glasses"" that would allow its virtual assistant Alexa to be summoned any time, anywhere, according to people familiar with its plans.
The device, which would tether wirelessly to a smartphone, is designed to look like a regular pair of spectacles so that it could be worn comfortably and unobtrusively, the people said. A bone-conduction audio system would allow the wearer to hear Alexa without having to insert headphones into their ears.
The glasses are not Amazon's only upcoming Alexa product launch. The Seattle-based group is also said to be expanding its ""smart home"" hardware line-up with a new home security camera system. The internet-connected camera would tie into its Echo products, for instance allowing people to view the video feed on Echo Show's screen, and letting Amazon customers see when their orders from the site have been delivered to their doorstep.
 Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1.
One or both of these products could be launched before the end of the year, alongside updates to existing Echo devices, according to the people with knowledge of Amazon's plans.
Amazon declined to comment.
While Amazon has had its fair share of failures — including the Fire phone, whose high-profile flop ended in a $170m writedown — the success of the Alexa devices has emboldened Amazon's push into the home.
Proximity to customers, and the ability to listen to them and respond to their needs, makes the Echo devices a key portal for Amazon. The company has sold ""tens of millions"" of Alexa-enabled devices worldwide.
Its plans for Alexa show Amazon is willing to take risks in new technologies and double down on areas of proven success.
Internet-connected security cameras are already a mainstay of the smart home. Products from big companies including Alphabet-owned Nest and Netgear, and start-ups such as Ring, August and Lighthouse, have shown a home camera can be a popular accessory even as other smart-home devices struggle to connect with mainstream consumers.
Amazon's secretive Lab 126 product development team has been given the task of studying the smart-home market to see what other devices might make sense for the company to build.
Launching a pair of smart glasses, however, is an unexpected and riskier move, given the category is almost entirely unproven among consumers.
Google Glass was introduced with huge fanfare in 2012 but was scrapped before a full consumer launch because of concerns about privacy, price and performance. Other smart glasses experiments remain in their infancy, including Snap's Spectacles that can shoot short bursts of video, and Vue, a start-up that raised $2.2m on Kickstarter last year for what it pitched as ""the world's first pair of smart glasses that are stylish and discreet"".
A wearable, always-on Alexa communicator could allow Amazon to overcome one hangover from its failure in the smartphone market. While iPhone users can call Siri, and Android users can summon Google's Assistant, simply by speaking their name, the Alexa app can only be accessed by unlocking the phone and opening an app.
In 2014, Amazon hired Babak Parviz, founder of Google Glass, who has been closely involved in its Alexa spectacles project. Several other Glass researchers, engineers and designers also have moved to Amazon's labs, analysis of LinkedIn profiles shows.
Amazon's glasses are likely to do away with the camera and screen that made Glass so controversial among privacy campaigners. Dropping those features would also improve the poor battery life that plagued Google's headset.
The glasses also could provide a platform for Amazon to move into the emerging market for ""augmented reality"" goggles. Microsoft, Magic Leap, Apple and Facebook are working on various headsets that would display digital images in front of the viewer's eyes.

 These high-flying life sciences stocks make Netflix and Amazon look dull   
 11:44  AM ET Wed, 20 Sept 2017 |  00:54 
 The giants of the internet economy are typically cast as the leading fetish objects for growth investors. But compared to the TAMP stocks, FANG looks a bit dull.
 What's TAMP,  you ask? That would be Thermo Fisher Scientific, Agilent, Mettler-Toledo and PerkinElmer, just a few of the seldom-discussed names that have powered the obscure S&P 500's life sciences tools & services subsector to a 41 percent year-to-date gain.
By comparison, FANG – Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet – are up less than 36 percent this year on an equal-weighted basis. 
 The life sciences tools group — which also includes Illumina, Waters and Quintiles IMS — totals more than $170 billion in market value (about equal to the size of Intel). The companies fall within the health-care sector, but they neither discover cures nor deliver care. They provide lab equipment, testing supplies, analytical devices and services to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, as well as some chemical and industrial customers.
Part of their appeal to investors in an aging and slow-growing world: They profit from the volume of new-drug investigations and lab tests, favorable demographics and the total amount of health care delivered globally but they don't have direct regulatory risk from drug-price controls or an Obamacare repeal.
It helps, too, that the companies generally are steady long-term performers that have done many bolt-on acquisitions in their chosen product areas and tend to convert mid-single-digit sales growth into low-double-digit per-share earnings expansion.
A strong and sustained rally in a cluster of stocks will always have a tidy fundamental story behind it, and here's the case for the lab-products names, according to analyst Paul Knight at Janney Montgomery Scott:
""Even with a sector showing strong performance in 2017, the fundamental backdrop for life science tools is becoming a 'Goldilocks' situation. Asia is the largest tools market and growth is in double digits, industrial demand is increasing with robust PMI indicators at seven-year highs, and currency tailwinds are developing.""
S&P 500/Life Sciences Tools & Services versus S&P 500 (YTD)
 Source: FactSet
More drug investigations and approved treatments, of increasing complexity, are expected. The booming field of immunotherapy development is a growth engine in itself, requiring complex material-handling and storage processes.
It all nets out to a dream growth-investor arrangement: Long-lived demographic forces, resistance to the economic cycle, stable business-to-business supply relationships, global distribution, and a ""razors and blades"" recurring-sales model.
The fact that these attributes have propelled such gaudy share-price gains, though, makes it worth asking whether professional investors are crowding into these names to hide from policy or macro threats that might, at some point, fade away.
In the current phase of the bull market, ""reliable growth companies"" that play a middleman role in de facto oligopolies have hogged a lot of the oxygen, at the expense of more cyclical plays, and especially consumer-facing companies whose moats are seen to be drying up.
Retail, media, branded-clothing and packaged-food stocks are suffering, as investors implicitly shun businesses that require consumers to make an active, conscious decision to spend on a product. Internet platforms, payment processors, aerospace, semiconductors and, yes, health-care tools companies have been enriched at their expense.
The result, for the life-sciences supply names, is valuations at the very high end of the stocks' own historical range. The TAMP stocks and their peers are now fetching between 20 and 40 times projected earnings for the coming year, compared to around 18 for the broader market. And, remember, these are companies generally growing not much faster than nominal world GDP, with admittedly attractive profit margins.
Technical analysts tend to love the group, identifying what look like sturdy long-term uptrends, even if some appear a bit stretched in the short term (note that the sector shed 1 percent on Tuesday in a largely flat market).
The risk to investors at these prices for the likes of Mettler-Toledo, PerkinElmer or Illumina is not that the companies stumble or laboratory volumes roll over. The stocks, instead, could be exposed to a change in investor preferences and outlook on the world.
If the bull market sputters, of course, it would not be kind to once-sleepy growth stocks at premium multiples. And if, instead, confidence grows in the economic-growth outlook and central banks do allow interest rates to rise, fewer investors might feel the need to hide in this corner of the health-care sector.
The question is not whether these are good businesses. They are. The riddle is always what assumptions motivated the last buyer of the stock of a fine business, and what price might be too high to pay for one.

 The company announced a hiring blitz in New York on Thursday. One job posting was for a user experience designer for ""Amazon Live,"" a start-up that ""leverages interactive streaming video to create new shopping experiences for customers,"" according to the job posting.
""This is a strategic initiative for the company with strong buy-in from top management,"" the posting said. 
 A handful of products on Amazon are listed as ""Amazon Live"" products. They are almost all beauty products with videos, similar to beauty product demonstrations that commonly appear on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. (A spokesperson for Amazon said that the service isn't new, and that it supports livestream shopping experiences.)
Amazon already has a variety of ""how-to"" videos on its platform, ranging from short cooking tutorials to home improvement to gadget reviews. Though some seem more like advertisements, others are hosted by professionals like journalists, aestheticians or professional make-up artists, and others are hosted by popular social media personalities.
But most of these videos are pre-recorded — not ""live"" or ""interactive"" as the job posting suggests. Amazon bought Twitch,  a live video platform for gamers, more than three years ago, but there hasn't been much overlap between Twitch and Amazon's retail business so far.
The existence of the start-up — which so far has flown under the radar — could signal an expansion of Amazon's quiet push into more social-media-like initiatives. This expansion of the Amazon Live team comes as Amazon is also recruiting YouTube personalities to sell Amazon-listed products through an ""influencers"" program.
Still, it wouldn't be the first time that Amazon dabbled in using video to sell beauty and fashion. It launched its first daily livestream show last year called ""Style Code Live,"" a ""What not to Wear""-like show that seems to have fizzled out. Some episodes of that show are also listed under the ""Amazon Live"" channel, which does not seem to appear in the Amazon channel directory.

 Amazon is bringing 2,000 jobs in advertising, fashion to New York City   
 12:50  PM ET Thu, 21 Sept 2017 |  00:46 
 Amazon is growing in New York City.
 The internet giant announced Thursday that it plans to bring more than 2,000 jobs to the city over the next three years, promising to create roughly 6,000 jobs across New York state by 2019.
Next year, Amazon will open a new office in Manhattan, which will be located aside the giant Hudson Yards development project. The company said this is all part of its ""ongoing job creation efforts.""
 Amazon will take 360,000 square feet of space at Brookfield's 5 Manhattan West.
In March, organic grocer Whole Foods Market — which is now owned by Amazon — announced it would anchor the ground-level retail space of 5 Manhattan West. Brookfield also recently worked on the location for Amazon's new European headquarters in the U.K., at Principal Place.
Once in New York City, Amazon plans to house its advertising team there, which focuses on marketing, product, design and engineering. Full-time positions are also up for grabs to work for Amazon Web Services and Amazon Fashion, the company said.
""We're excited to expand our presence in New York – we have always found great talent here,"" added Paul Kotas, Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide advertising.
Meantime, Amazon is in the midst of scouting a location for its second headquarters — a search that the company announced earlier this month.
A spokesperson for New York City mayor's office had told CNBC: ""New York City has the most innovative and diverse tech sector in the nation. ... We are very interested in the possibility of Amazon locating a headquarters in the five boroughs, and believe the city's competitive advantages position it well.""
On Thursday, a source familiar with Amazon's plans said that the 2,000 jobs coming to New York were decided upon prior to Amazon's HQ2 announcement, and shouldn't be seen as any kind of endorsement for New York City in that search.
Amazon is also planning to open a fulfillment center in Staten Island. It currently houses a Fashion photo studio in Brooklyn, along with two Amazon Books locations in New York City.

 Olo CEO Noah Glass: Providing restaurants new online business through Amazon   
 11:57  AM ET Fri, 22 Sept 2017 |  03:15 
 Amazon bought grocery chain Whole Foods, and now it wants to work with more restaurants as it moves further into the food industry.
 The internet giant has partnered with Olo, a New York-based food delivery service, to list Olo's clients on the Amazon Restaurants food delivery section of Amazon.com.
GrubHub, a rival Chicago-based restaurant takeout service, saw its shares fall more than 6 percent on the news, before regaining some ground to a drop of nearly 2 percent.
 ""Amazon's obsession with providing great customer and restaurant experience supports the evolving expectations and behaviors of today's consumer,"" said Noah Glass, CEO of Olo, about the deal.
 Amazon Restaurants has integrated into Rails, Olo's application programming interface, which allows for restaurants to list their menus on third-party marketplaces.
Through the integration, Olo's restaurant partners will be featured on Amazon Restaurants, enabling orders through the delivery provider to go directly through a point-of-sale system.
Some of Olo's clients include Chipotle, Denny's, Shake Shack and Wingstop.
The goal of this partnership is to simplify the process for restaurants once customers' orders come in, while also allowing for companies to limit the amount of orders that they take during peak hours, Olo said in a press release.
 ""This integration will enable Amazon Restaurants to onboard new restaurants with ease, as well as quickly add more new choices and delivery options for customers,"" added Gus Lopez, general manager of Amazon Restaurants.
""We are excited to leverage Olo's digital ordering technology and continue rapidly growing our network of restaurants to give Amazon Prime members more options for fast delivery from their favorite brands,"" Lopez said.
GrubHub shares have been on a tear this year, up more than 35 percent in 2017. Last month, Yelp announced it was selling Eat24, its online food-ordering business, to GrubHub. The brands Seamless and MenuPages are also owned by GrubHub.
The race is on to get food delivered from popular restaurants to customers, and more quickly than ever before.

 Olo CEO Noah Glass: Providing restaurants new online business through Amazon   
 11:57  AM ET Fri, 22 Sept 2017 |  03:15 
 Amazon showed it remains committed to the restaurant delivery business Friday by announcing a new partnership with Olo, a restaurant ordering software maker.
 The partnership will give Amazon access to the thousands of restaurant customers using Olo's software, potentially opening up a huge untapped market for Amazon Restaurants, its food delivery service. GrubHub, the leader in this space, saw its stock drop by as much as 7 percent after the announcement.
But for Amazon Restaurants to really grow, it may first need to solve one major concern: It's too expensive.
 According to Cowen & Co. analyst Thomas Champion, some investors have expressed concerns over Amazon Restaurants' high take rate, which is reported to be close to 30 percent. That means Amazon charges restaurants 30 cents for every dollar made from each food delivery.
Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

 The 30 percent take rate is substantially higher than what some of the competitors in the food delivery space charge. The NY Post reported last year that market leaders such as GrubHub and Seamless charge somewhere between 12 and 24 percent, while upstarts such as DoorDash and Postmates have a take rate in the range of 15 to 23 percent.
In fact, Ruby Tuesday, which is running a pilot program with Amazon Restaurants, said in its most recent earnings call that Amazon's food delivery program is indeed costly. Ruby Tuesday CEO James Hyatt pointed out it's something every restaurant will have to test before deciding if they should build their own delivery network or not.
""It is a little expensive,"" Hyatt said, referring to delivery programs by Amazon, Uber and Lyft. ""It is a bite of the apple there for sure, and it seems to be something that every brand is going to have to measure right now, which I think you see some of the brands determining that they want to make that an internal mechanism instead of using a third-party.""
Amazon may be able to lower its take rate once it reaches broader scale, and its partnership with Olo could be one way to solve the problem. 
But Cowen's Champion said it shouldn't be a major concern to incumbents such as GrubHub, at least for now, pointing out that Amazon Restaurants is still only the fifth-most-used delivery service with less than a third of GrubHub's usage, based on a recent survey.
""It remains an expansive $40 billion-plus market in the US, with solid growth characteristics. We expect the delivery market to remain competitive and we think GrubHub will compete just fine,"" he wrote.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a company conference in London in November 2014.
 Microsoft on Monday announced updates to its Azure public cloud that make it a more formidable challenger to market leader Amazon Web Services.
 Microsoft unveiled a piece of hardware full of hard drives that companies can fill up with data before sending it off to Microsoft data centers. Companies would use this service for sending massive amounts of data they want Microsoft to host, but that would be too slow or costly to upload over the internet. AWS did something like that in 2015.
Microsoft is also introducing a service that will ease the migration of databases from on-premises data centers into its cloud, and it will start letting people reserve computing resources for future use — at lower prices than they would ordinarily pay. AWS announced a database migration service in 2015 and reserved instances in 2009.
 And following the 2016 introduction of AWS' Shield service, which stops applications from being overwhelmed by distributed denial-of-service attacks, Microsoft is now coming out with a comparable tool — the same technology that Microsoft uses to keep Office 365 and Xbox Live running.
AWS held 34 percent of the market for cloud infrastructure services in the second quarter, and Azure, its closest competitor, had 11 percent, according to Synergy Research Group. Microsoft has consistently sought to keep up with AWS by matching prices for core computing and storage in Azure, and making its cloud services available from more places around the world alongside AWS.
Earlier this year Alphabet's Google cloud — which had 5 percent of the cloud infrastructure market, according to Synergy — showed off Cloud Dataprep, an app for easily cleaning up data and getting it ready for deep analysis. Now Microsoft is responding with a data cleaning tool of its own that ""learns your data preparation steps as you perform them,"" a Microsoft spokesman wrote in an email.

 Amazon can't compete with off-price retailers, JPMorgan says   
 3:02  PM ET Mon, 25 Sept 2017 |  00:56 
 Here's a bright and booming sector within retail.
 Off-price retailers — TJ Maxx owner TJX, Ross Stores and Burlington — are expected to see incremental sales growth of $18 billion to $19 billion by 2021, according to JPMorgan. And that boost will primarily stem from the demise of department store chains, analyst Matthew Boss wrote in a Monday note to clients.
""We expect off-price will be the primary beneficiary of this brick & mortar sales volume up for grabs and benefit from the plethora of close-out merchandise for several years,"" Boss said.
 And when it comes to the growing threat of Amazon, the Street shouldn't be worried about off-price players losing market share, Boss added.
Shares of Ross Stores were climbing more than 3 percent Monday, following JPMorgan's report.
TJX's stock was up more than 1 percent, while shares of Burlington were up close to 2.5 percent on the day. Burlington has been the biggest gainer of the three of late, having climbed more than 8 percent in 2017.
Here's the argument for off-price retail: Amazon's encroachment into the apparel industry more closely resembles a full-price department store, instead of a Ross or TJ Maxx model, JPMorgan's Boss said. He cited the internet giant's Prime Wardrobe pricing structure as an example, saying the fashion focus at Amazon instead looks to mirror companies like Macy's and J.C. Penney.
Since 2011, department stores have lost roughly $25 billion in sales on a combined basis, and are on pace to lose another $22 billion in sales over the next five years, should the downward trend continue, JPMorgan found.
Off-price retailers, on the other hand, have gained $14 billion since 2011, the firm said.
JPMorgan has upgraded Ross Stores to overweight, giving the stock a fresh price target of $74 per share, up from $65. The stock was trading near $63 per share Monday morning.
An important point to also be made is just how difficult the off-price model — offering a treasure-hunt type experience — would be for Amazon to copy online, Boss emphasized in his report. He cites ""high barriers to entry"" to tapping into the concept successfully.
""The model is difficult to replicate with over 1,000 buyers worldwide currently sourcing from 18,000 vendors in 100+ countries,"" he said.
Ross Stores' management team has also stepped up defending its turf.
""If I was Amazon, I don't think I'd be looking at the off-price space as my big opportunity,"" Ross Stores chief operating officer, Michael O'Sullivan, said at an investor conference earlier this month.
""I think within the world of retail, especially given the economics ... I don't think off-price is really the place where I'd focus my energy,"" O'Sullivan added about Amazon. ""Doing a treasure hunt online is much more hit or miss, because you are not actually seeing — or you're seeing it, you're just not experiencing the product in a same way that you would if you were in a store.""
Amazon didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
At a time when many retailers are shuttering stores to get back to a ""healthy"" footprint, off-price companies have plans to open more doors in the years ahead. TJX even recently rolled out an entirely new nameplate, Homesense, in the United States.
JPMorgan has called out Ross' long-term store target of 2,500 locations as being ""conservative.""
""The growth runway for ROST is well beyond 10 years,"" he said, adding that — based on meetings with Ross' management team — JPMorgan believes real estate landlords are more willing to partner with Ross today, especially given the ""fall-out"" in the sporting goods and office space.
Ross Stores, TJX and Burlington are each forecasting same-store sales growth to close out the year — not something many retailers can promise in such a volatile market today.

Jeff Bezos
 Business leaders in Tucson, Ariz., have tried to mail Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, a 21-foot cactus. The largest conference room in the Tulsa, Okla., mayor’s office has been converted to a war room, with 50 volunteers poring over videos of Mr. Bezos.
In Philadelphia, hundreds of Wharton Business School students have a new fall semester assignment: pitch the city to Amazon. And the mayor of Ottawa flew to Seattle last week to walk as close to Amazon’s headquarters as is publicly accessible.
“It’s like ‘The Amazing Race,’” said Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa. “You’ve got this cast of characters running toward the Holy Grail.”
 Amazon, on the hunt for a place to build a second headquarters where it plans to invest $5 billion and create 50,000 jobs, has begun an enormous competition among cities across North America. With a loose set of requirements like proximity to an airport and walkability, the e-commerce behemoth has set officials on a journey to sell their towns, with the aim of getting in on what some are calling one of the largest economic development deals of the century.
That sometimes means going to extreme lengths to draw Mr. Bezos’ eye. Is Mr. Bezos impressed?
“We’re energized by the response,” said Adam Sedo, an Amazon spokesman. “We invited cities to think big, and we are starting to see their creativity.”
For Jeff Cheney, the mayor of Frisco, Tex., a city of 160,000 about a half-hour drive from Dallas, the courtship includes offering to build his city around Amazon.
“Our city’s only about 60 percent built out, so we’ve got a lot of available land where we can build to suit,” Mr. Cheney said. “We play to win. We’re innovators. We’re forward thinkers, and we’re serious.”
City applications are not due until Oct. 19, but Mr. Cheney has already sent a video letter to Amazon. The video opens on him holding an Amazon box and saying, “Amazon, you’re growing your business, and we want to grow with you.” Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, is seen talking about catching the “Frisco Flu,” which the mayor’s office said was a phrase Mr. Jones came up with. Mr. Cheney also gets a Jamba Juice (Jamba Juice is based in Frisco).
Mayoral letters to Amazon are actually becoming a YouTube subgenre.
Mark D. Boughton, the mayor of Danbury, Conn., posted a video on Sept. 14 calling himself a “proud Amazon customer” and asking Alexa, the Amazon virtual assistant, where Amazon should build its second headquarters. “Danbury,” a female voice responds.
It seems Alexa might be suffering a software glitch, because when Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, posted a video on Sept. 15 asking, “Alexa, where is the most interesting company in the world going to locate?” there was a different response. “Obviously, Washington, D.C.,” said Alexa.
In Canada, the selling point is, well, Canada.
“Amazon has something like 9,000 engineering jobs they can’t fill. Our immigration policy is much more liberal,” said Mr. Watson, Ottawa’s mayor. “That’s where we have an advantage.”
Another city offering access to Canadian immigration as part of its deal is, surprisingly, Detroit. Working with nearby Windsor, Canada, which is an eight-minute drive away, Detroit is portraying itself as the best of both worlds.
“There’s, you know, the immigration issue — we avoid that,” said Dan Gilbert, a local business leader in Detroit who was asked by the city’s mayor, Mike Duggan, to lead the effort to land Amazon.“You’ve got Canada and the U.S. And people will come from all over.”
Mr. Gilbert, the founder of Quicken Loans, has also built an Amazon war room, where more than 40 people are trying to analyze what the online retailer “likes and doesn’t like.” They are also trying to read Mr. Bezos’ psyche. “He’s got hundreds of hours of videos on YouTube you can watch,” Mr. Gilbert said.
Mr. Gilbert is the largest private property owner in downtown Detroit, and he said he would move his tenants to temporary locations to make room for Amazon so the company does not have to wait for new offices to be built.
Competitions for factories or stadiums are typically more private, but this one is playing out in the court of public opinion, said Lauren Hitt, who is managing the public side of the campaign for Philadelphia.
“The competition started that Thursday morning when he announced it,” Ms. Hitt said of Mr. Bezos. “The next weeks are basically going to be a sustained campaign.”
Philadelphia’s effort includes students from the Wharton School writing variations on the very same pitch: why Amazon should come to Philadelphia. This was the school’s idea, said Ms. Hitt. Dozens of start-ups have also been asked to submit testimonials about the city’s innovation economy and advice on how to approach Amazon.
And Philadelphia, which sent a delegation to Seattle last week, is sending a larger delegation this week to “get into the Jeff Bezos mind-set and ethos,” Ms. Hitt said.
The city would also consider overhauling its tax system for Amazon.
“Having Amazon would mean global things for our tax system,” Ms. Hitt said. “We do have business taxes, but that’s something that could be looked at in the scope of Amazon coming here.”
G. T. Bynum, the mayor of Tulsa, which set up its own Amazon war room in his office, echoed Philadelphia’s sentiment on taxes. He said he “doesn’t worry at all” about tax incentives going too far. “These are 50,000 jobs with the most innovative company in the world.”
“Whatever it takes,” he said.

Tax policy experts are more skeptical of Amazon’s bidding process and how much cities stand to benefit.
“Why are they doing this whole dog and pony show? Amazon wants something for nothing,” said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan think tank. “They would like a package of tax incentives for something they were going to do anyway.”
Art Rolnick, an economist at the University of Minnesota, called Amazon’s bidding process — and the broader practice of cities competing for stadiums and factories — “blackmail.”
“If you look at it from a national perspective, it’s zero returns. Minnesota might win one, Wisconsin wins the next one. The company wins each time,” Mr. Rolnick said. “It’s corporate welfare.”
But Mr. Gardner acknowledged that many cities really have no other course than to try and win Amazon. “If you ask any mayor, they’ll say their first job is to bring good jobs to the city,” he said. “And Amazon is promising to bring a lot of jobs.”
Joe Snell, a business leader with an economic development group in Tucson, was behind the recent shipment to Mr. Bezos of the local saguaro cactus, which he said was symbolic of the region’s people.
“It’s a hearty plant. It can grow up to 40 feet. And that’s Tucson,” Mr. Snell said. “We’re a community that’s growing. We’re adaptive. And we’re durable.”
Amazon said it could not accept gifts but thanked Tucson on Twitter. The company then returned the plant to the city. That was a good outcome for the cactus, which would suffer in the Seattle rain.
Still, Mr. Snell had achieved his goal.
“We wanted to cut through the noise, and they definitely noticed it,” he said. “And when they choose Tucson, they can come out and experience a million saguaros.”

President Donal Trump (R) and his daughter Ivanka (L) chairs a a workforce development roundtable discussion at Waukesha County Technical College during his visit in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on June 13, 2017.
 President Donald Trump will issue a new directive Monday to supercharge the U.S. government's support for science, tech, engineering and mathematics, including coding education, three sources familiar with the White House's thinking told Recode.
To start, Trump is set to sign a presidential memorandum at the White House later today that tasks the Department of Education to devote at least $200 million of its grant funds each year to so-called STEM fields, as the administration seeks to train workers for high-demand computer-science jobs of the future.
And on Tuesday, Trump's daughter and advisor, Ivanka, is expected to head to Detroit, where she will join business leaders for an event unveiling a series of private-sector commitments — from Amazon, Facebook, Google, GM, Quicken Loans and others — meant to boost U.S. coding and computer-science classes and programs, the sources said. The exact total of their financial pledges is unclear.
 The new White House emphasis on STEM and computer science amounts to something of a policy coup for the tech industry, which long has implored the U.S. government to prioritize education in those high-demand fields.
In the eyes of Code.org, one of the organizations working with the White House, not even half of U.S. high schools offer computer science classes. To that end,  Apple chief executive Tim Cook urged Trump to make coding a requirement in public schools when he joined the president and other tech leaders at the  White House's so-called ""tech week"" this June.
A month later, Cook and other business leaders, including Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson and Microsoft President Brad Smith, huddled with the Trump administration — including Ivanka — on a private call to discuss ways to rethink federal policy through a tech lens, sources told Recode this week.
But the White House's announcement nonetheless comes at a perilous moment for tech, corporate America and the Trump presidency.

A month ago, scores of executives, including tech giants,  resigned their posts on two councils advising Trump on business and manufacturing issues, citing Trump's early refusal to blame the violence in Charlottesville, Va., on neo-Nazi demonstrators. More recently, the leaders of Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have  openly criticized the president for ending an immigration program known as DACA, which protects children brought to the United States illegally from being deported.
Many of those tech giants are now lobbying the White House and Congress intensely to restore the legal shield for roughly  800,000 beneficiaries, known as Dreamers. And those participating in the White House's computer-science announcement this week could find themselves under immense, new pressure — particularly from their employees — to use the opportunity to continue  trying to advance immigration reform and other, related issues.
Some of the tech giants promising new dollars for coding education came to the table as a result of the Internet Association, the Washington, D.C.-based lobbying voice for the Valley. Other participants include Accenture, Intuit, Salesforce and Pluralsight, an online education company.
Ivanka Trump, for her part, has focused recently on issues like  workforce development. ""By supporting computer science curriculum in our schools, I hope that all children will have the opportunity to become fluent in this language of the future,"" she posted to Instagram in June — along with a photo in which she's sitting with her daughter, Arabella, learning how to code.
But that, too, hasn't come without controversy. Earlier this year, a prominent advocate for more women in tech — Girls Who Code — slammed Ivanka for  being ""complicit"" in advancing Trump's agenda.

 });David Mitroff, a marketing expert and founder of Piedmont Avenue Consulting, uses Amazon Prime for both business and personal use almost every day, ""if not twice a day,"" he says.
 And Mitroff doesn't like what he sees in the future of the small-business community as a result of his own growing reliance on the tech and retail giant's e-commerce offerings.
""I do worry more and more as I use it ... yet I still use it,"" Mitroff said. ""I do worry that local stores will close or there will be no place to go touch things and see things in person. Sometimes I try to stop myself from ordering and go to the nearby store. However, it is so much more efficient as a small-business owner. When I need more printer paper or office snacks or anything ... It is scary that literally across the street or around the corner I can buy most of the things I need, however it is so easy to place the order and get back to work.""
 Mitroff is not alone, and business reliance on Amazon filters down through the ranks of small-business managers.
""Do I want to get on the road and ride bumper to bumper to get to the store for a few items, such as stationery and a couple of boxes of Lipton tea?"" said Belinda Foster, director of marketing at PR firm AWJ Platinum. ""I find myself opening up a browser on my tablet, and with a click of the wrist, I shop within a 10-minute time frame. ... I find that I have less stress throughout the day, thanks to shopping online. ... I see it as a stress buster.""

 Matt Ham, president and owner of Computer Repair Doctor, said his business spends roughly $11,000–$12,000 per month buying office supplies and parts through its Amazon Prime account.

 Small-business owners who say their businesses are helped by Amazon are more likely to live in households that subscribe to Amazon Prime than those whose businesses compete with Amazon for customers (68 percent vs. 54 percent).
 Finding ways to become more competitive through Amazon 
 The CNBC/SurveyMonkey data also shows that small-business owners aren't exhibiting a broader fear of innovation. Only 8 percent of small-business owners said technological innovation will have a negative effect on their business in the next year, while 42 percent said it will have a positive effect (49 percent answered ""no effect""). 
Some are finding ways to use Amazon as much as it uses them — specifically, to size up the competition and test out new products.
""We can see what everyone is doing, what they are selling and how well they are selling,"" said Sean Allan of SiamMandalay, which creates educational puzzles and games. ""If you know where to look, it's all there. I can see how well a product sells, as well as how many they sell in a day."" 
Wayne Perry of natural health product manufacturer GSC Products said the company has been using Amazon not just to buy ingredients and supplies but to test new products and as a price control, which in turn allows it to better price for its other sales channels.
 ""The thing that truly freaks me out is that sometimes I place an order at 9 a.m. or even 10 a.m. and have the items in my hand the same day, before I leave the office.""
-David Mitroff, founder of Piedmont Avenue Consulting, who uses Amazon Prime once, if not twice, most days
 Whenever GSC launches a new brand or product, it limits initial sales to its own Amazon store and several large Amazon sellers who use Amazon fulfillment, professional Amazon sellers (not stores) who sell hundreds if not thousands of product offerings in their catalogs. ""We can tell within four months if it's a winner or loser,"" Perry said. 
If the product is a winner, then GSC will push it out to the bigger Amazon sellers network so they can handle fulfillment through Amazon and ""the headaches that come along with that,"" Perry said. GSC then concentrates on wholesaling the product to other web retailers and traditional stores. By working with small groups of large Amazon sellers, it can make sure that Amazon doesn't undercut the pricing in brick-and-mortar stores. ""That's become a huge problem these days, because brick-and-mortar retailers won't take your products if a consumer can simply look on their phone and find it way cheaper on Amazon,"" Perry said.
GSC can also adjust pricing for products that are selling slowly and get an idea for what the MSRP should be on other web sales platforms and in stores, but it's not always about lower prices. ""We have learned that certain products sell better at a higher price, believe it or not. Amazon teaches you so much about consumer buying habits without having to spend thousands on focus groups and you're making money while testing your products,"" Perry said.
 In general, do you think that Amazon is good for small businesses, bad for small businesses, or has no effect on small businesses?

More from the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey:Small-business confidence drops, even among conservatives
The small-business owners who use Amazon frequently don't mince words about the worst-case scenario in this fast-evolving ""frenemy"" relationship.
""Prime shipping and the one-stop-marketplace nature of Amazon is so powerful, it's ridiculous to think we can compete,"" Allan said. ""The biggest buying and selling advantage is Prime shipping. Next-day delivery anywhere in the country on nearly any product ... How can you compete with that?"" 
Mitroff said he does see the retail world changing, with stores designed more for demonstrated products that will be delivered to your office or home. And for specialized products — or when education or appreciation of art is needed — the sales process is different. But for generic products, it's all about being delivered on demand. 
""The thing that truly freaks me out is that sometimes I place an order at 9 a.m. or even 10 a.m. and have the items in my hand the same day, before I leave the office,"" he said.

Robert Kirkman
 In August, production company Skybound signed a first-look production agreement with Amazon. The company was co-founded by Robert Kirkman, who is behind top TV shows like AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" and Cinemax's ""Outcast,"" and the deal ensures that his future shows will go to Amazon first.
Why'd he make the move? According to Skybound managing partner Jon Goldman, it's because Amazon has all the pieces in place to help TV shows expand beyond television and become entire franchises, something its competitors such as Netflix aren't as adept at doing.
 ""There are more aspects to IP (intellectual property) than just the TV show,"" Goldman said to CNBC. 
For example, a franchise such as ""The Walking Dead"" isn't just a TV show, but can come with merchandise, video games and comic books, he explained. With Amazon's retail business built in and its close relationship with the gaming community through Twitch, it was a cultural fit and allowed Skybound to expand its own properties. 
""We don't view a TV show as the tip of the spear and everything follows,"" Goldman said. ""We consider everything primary.""

Shoppers at a Kroger supermarket in Peoria, Ill.
 Kroger is now making it a priority to partner with local brands at its supermarket stores across the U.S., right as Amazon-owned Whole Foods prepares to step back similar efforts.
 Just last week, Kroger announced plans to roll out a website aimed at luring more local brands to its stores.
Currently, Kroger sources from thousands of local suppliers, but it's looking to grow that number, according to Mike Donnelly, Kroger's executive vice president of merchandising and procurement.
 Kroger, which owns other supermarkets including Ralphs and Harris Teeter, is now inviting local vendors to join its team. Kroger's new website reads: ""Kroger Loves Local"" and ""We Are Local.""
Food sampling and in-store education about local brands will continue to be a part of the Kroger shopping experience, a Kroger spokeswoman told CNBC. The chain also wants to grow the dialogue around shopping and eating local.
Retail rival Whole Foods is meantime looking to follow a different strategy, simplifying operations and cutting back on some local initiatives. Beginning next year, the organic supermarket chain will reportedly no longer allow brand representatives to promote their products, nor can they check stores to make sure items are stocked and displayed correctly, according to The Wall Street Journal.
It's long been the norm for local brands to set up tables throughout Whole Foods stores during peak selling hours, offering samples and educating shoppers on niche items. It's served as a way for smaller brand names to market themselves, when they might not be noticed on a shelf at first glance.
""Whole Foods once found a way for local brands to have a great American story come to life ... [they] allowed brands to come into aisles, to tell their stories,"" Mike McDevitt, CEO of Baltimore-based meal-kit company Terra's Kitchen, told CNBC.
""While it's great to hear that the doors of Kroger are being open [to local brands] now, they're probably going to be cracked open, not wide open,"" McDevitt said. Whole Foods, he said, was becoming too difficult to manage from a national, profit-driven perspective.
""All Whole Foods Market stores will continue to sell local products, and our buyers remain committed to discovering and incubating local and innovative brands,"" Whole Foods spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan told CNBC in a statement.
Whole Foods will also begin to centralize its decision-making regarding brands' product assortment, the Journal reported.
Instead of allowing brands to pitch their products on a local scale, for example, Whole Foods' top executives will choose a higher percentage of the inventory moving forward, the publication said, citing conversations between Whole Foods and third-party brand representatives during a series of recent closed-door meetings.
A Whole Foods spokeswoman had told the Journal that ""having brand advocates in stores is distracting to employees and inefficient."" The new system, she told the publication, aims to cut costs and take a ""national approach.""
Time will tell if Whole Foods shoppers agree — or even notice — Amazon's push to nationalize the chain.
A study by location intelligence company Foursquare found a 25 percent increase in foot traffic at Whole Foods stores over the first two days, Aug. 28 and 29, that the company was owned by Amazon. 
Since then, though, traffic has dropped off, Foursquare told CNBC in a follow-up study. In its second week under Amazon's wings, from Sept. 4 to Sept. 10, traffic was only up about 8 percent when compared with an ""average"" week in August 2017.
To be sure, Kroger has taken a beating ever since the Amazon-Whole Foods deal was announced in mid-June. Its stock is down more than 40 percent in 2017 alone.
Yet, Kroger isn't giving up without a fight, recently announcing new initiatives like its plans to open a ""comfort food"" restaurant, called Kitchen 1883, at a store near its corporate headquarters in Cincinnati.
Kroger is also growing its meal kits business, which it calls Prep+Pared. The company has been adding the kits to additional Kroger stores this month. Just last week, grocery chain Albertsons announced it would acquire meal kits business Plated, sending Blue Apron shares higher on speculation that there's hope for that sector after all.
""Kroger is making a wise move strategically in reaching out to local and emerging brands as the number of such brands are growing, and consumers are interested in having access to such brands,"" Brittain Ladd, a retail strategy, supply chain and logistics consultant, told CNBC. ""Kroger continues to prove they're the best grocery retailer in the United States, and they will continue to fight for their customers and brands,"" Ladd added. ""Amazon has no choice but to implement strategies that will increase operational efficiencies.""

Diagram showing Amazon ""Alexa"" technology on an Echo device
 Amazon's voice technology Alexa has a lot of opportunity to be used in health care, whether it's for remote monitoring of sick patients or in helping doctors take notes during patient visits. 
 But there's one big problem.
Alexa is not yet HIPAA-compliant, meaning it doesn't meet the federal rules that protect patient privacy when it comes to their personal health data. 
 Not all health app developers will be subject to HIPAA, but the law requires that ""covered entities,"" such as doctors and health plans, as well as their business associates, are compliant.
That means that health developers can build Amazon Alexa skills around things like recommending nutritious food, but not to record patients' lab results or other types of health information in a clinical setting.

 Amazon acknowledged this problem on Monday at an event called the ""diabetes challenge,"" where it worked with a series of partners to promote use-cases for Alexa for patients with diabetes. The finalists include a personal assistant or coach for patients with diabetes, and a virtual nutrition assistant. 
For the challenge, Amazon is partnered up with the drug maker Merck and strategy firm Luminary Labs. 
At the event, Amazon Web Services' health lead Oxana Pickeral publicly acknowledged the gap -- and implied that Amazon would be taking steps to fix it.
""While Alexa and Lex (the technology powering Alexa) are not HIPAA-eligible, this (challenge) has provided us an opportunity to envision what is possible,"" she said. 
It's worth noting that it took some time for Amazon Web Services, its cloud service, to become compliant so it could work with covered entities that manage personal health information. But now, it is the dominant cloud provider for health care.

 VMware exec on the 'new hardware economy'   
 6:53  PM ET Tue, 26 Sept 2017 |  00:59 
 Twenty years ago, the hardware economy was responsible for massive hard drives and clunky PCs. But one VMware executive told CNBC that there's a new iteration at work.
 As more and more companies turn to cloud-based solutions in order to cut costs and connect with an increasingly digital world, Sanjay Poonen, VMware's chief operating officer of customer operations, said many are embracing a hybrid approach to the new technology.
""As you think about companies and their future, they have to decide how much data center capacity they want to use now,"" Poonen told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Tuesday. ""Some people feel they run a data center very well. We can help them modernize it with software, and that's what we do very well. Some of the companies say, 'Listen, I don't want to expand a lot of my data centers. I want to use the new hardware economy.' If you talked about the hardware economy 20 years ago it was Dell, HP, IBM, Fujitsu, Cisco. The new hardware economy is not just those players, but [Amazon Web Services], [Microsoft] Azure, Google, IBM.""
 VMware, a cloud infrastructure, data center and virtualization company, recently partnered with Amazon Web Services, the online giant's cloud computing arm, to provide customers with a more integrated solution.
""If you could get the benefit of both worlds, the same tools that you've known at VMware for managing and automating that, but get the data center capacity on the fly, that's what we've brilliantly innovated here,"" Poonen said.
VMware's central aim is to help high-profile customers like Coca-Cola and Nike manage on-premise and private cloud operations, pair those functions with the public cloud and develop technology across the data center, the cloud and the mobile landscape.
The company's 500,000 customers include an assortment of retailers, almost all of whom use the cloud giant's AirWatch technology in their stores to help secure devices they sell, the COO said.
Poonen added that Nike plans to build out data centers and many of its ""next generation, consumer-facing apps"" with VMware.
""The key thing ... is to become a trusted advisor to your customer, and that's what we're doing,"" he said.
And when it comes to concern about a slowdown in cloud growth or companies' hesitation to make the move to ""new hardware,"" Poonen said it's overblown, especially considering VMware's position.
""We think there's going to be a good amount of spending in the private cloud on-premise and into the public cloud. And we feel we're one of those quintessential companies that can bridge both sides of that chasm. And, you know, we'll have to see [what] the future holds in terms of public spending and also private spending, but we feel optimistic and that's what we've seen in both our results the last several quarters and how we look into the future,"" Poonen told Cramer. ""I think there's innovation to be had in tech.""

 Famed talk-radio host Mike Francesa loves trading stocks on top of keeping up with the latest sports news.
CNBC's Scott Wapner asked Francesa which stocks he is buying now.
 ""I'm a big tech guy, so I'm a big Nvidia guy, I'm a big Amazon guy always,"" Francesa said on CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" Tuesday.
""I tell you one that Josh [Brown] gave me that did really well, ALB [Albemarle]. I still own it … He made me a lot of money with that stock,"" he added.
The radio legend's picks are crushing the market this year so far – Albemarle is up 50 percent year to date, Nvidia is up 64 percent and Amazon is up 25 percent through midday Tuesday compared with the S&P 500's 12 percent return.
Francesa hosts the popular ""Mike's On: Francesa on the FAN"" sports talk radio show on New York station WFAN. He is slated to retire on Dec. 15 after three decades with the station.

 Twilio drops on competing product from Amazon web services   
 7:34  PM ET Tue, 26 Sept 2017 |  00:22 
 Shares of Twilio were sharply lower on Tuesday afternoon after an announcement from Amazon saying that its Pinpoint system now allows users to trigger 2-way SMS messaging.
 Twilio fell 6.6 percent into the closing bell, though shares pared losses after hours. 
Amazon's Pinpoint lets app managers ""determine which push notifications to send, decide when to deliver the notifications, and track the results of your campaign."" (It's worth noting that AWS has had SMS texting capability through its Simple Notification Service since 2011.)
 ""This is a continuation of our technology partnership with Amazon. Two-way SMS is another capability being utilized by Amazon Pinpoint as part of our existing relationship,"" said a Twilio spokesperson.
Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson, who used to work at Amazon, said in a tweet that he's ""excited that Twilio is now helping to power engagement on @AWS Pinpoint.""
 Tweet
 Twilio was heralded as one of the major IPOs of 2016 when it went public. But, despite some strong quarterly earnings reports, shares have fallen more than 57 percent over the past 12 months, as the company lowered its revenue expectations after its largest customer, Uber, said it would change the way it handled in-app communications, according to Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White.

 Billionaire investor Sam Zell: Retail landscape looks like a 'falling knife'   
 8:49  AM ET Tue, 26 Sept 2017 |  04:17 
 Amazon's recent $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods won't really change brick-and-mortar retail, billionaire real estate investor Sam Zell told CNBC on Tuesday.
 ""I don't mean to be disrespectful of Amazon, but I don't think Amazon reinvented the wheel. I don't think buying Whole Foods is going to make it easier for Amazon to fulfill its objectives,"" Zell said on ""Squawk Box.""
The founder and chairman of property specialist Equity Group Investments believes physical Whole Foods stores five years from now ""will be half the size they are today or maybe even smaller."" Zell also chairs five NYSE-listed companies, including three real estate investment trusts.
 ""Basically, Amazon is buying depots, not retailers,"" argued Zell, suggesting that Amazon benefits more from having local locations for shipping and online purchase pickups rather than from running actual stores.
 Brendan McDermid | Reuters
Apples are displayed at a Whole Foods store in New York City, August 28, 2017.
 Known for seeking out and investing in diamonds in the rough, Zell described the real estate side of the retail business as ""a falling knife.""
""I'm generally a contrarian. I generally rub my hands together at the opportunity for serious dislodgement,"" he said. ""[But] an area that's in this much disarray, with so many weak players, it's not an area where I would want to deploy capital at this time.""
Zell did say that in many cases the locations of retail stores are desirable, even if the objectives of the businesses are not.
""The basic regional mall is becoming a mini-downtown, and becoming much more diverse. And therefore saving itself,"" he said. ""The local corner strip center is still convenience. Everything in between is an oxymoron.""
The real problem has to do with supply, Zell said. ""The U.S. has four or five times the amount of square footage per person of retail as anywhere else in the world."" As the industry deals with a correction, retail is going to be ""less comfortable for the next few years,"" he added.

 Amazon gets its most bullish Wall Street call yet: $1,400 price forecast

 Amazon shares are faltering this month along with many of its large-cap technology company peers. But the pullback is a buying opportunity, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Wells Fargo Securities began coverage of Amazon with an outperform rating on its shares and a price target of $1,400, which is 49 percent above Tuesday's closing price. It is also the highest target out of the 42 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet.
Wells' analyst predicts the internet giant will be able to use artificial intelligence and data analysis to dominate new industries.
 ""Given a strong customer experience, scaled infrastructure investments, high user engagement, and lead within Cloud, we believe AMZN is among the best positioned to apply these neural network advances [artificial intelligence] across new verticals/industries,"" analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We see this lead in data, coupled with the company's edge in compute efficiency, as increasingly feeding insights into supply chain, for its retail, video, and other efforts, and through AWS, for its partners.""
Amazon shares have rallied 25 percent this year through Tuesday, compared with the market's 12 percent gain. But the stock is down 4 percent this month compared with the S&P 500's 1 percent gain.
Amazon Web Services has 46 percent of the ""infrastructure-as-a-service"" commercial cloud computing market. Sena noted that the research firm IDC estimates the total public cloud computing market will grow to more than $200 billion by 2020. He also predicts the company can gain market share in the apparel, over-the-counter medicine and grocery product categories, which represent another $130 billion of potential sales in the U.S.
The e-commerce giant operates on a so-called flywheel model in which low prices, repeat shoppers and a positive experience for buyers and sellers create a self-perpetuating cycle of growth. ""We see Amazon's famous flywheel as spinning with increasingly impenetrable force, where customer experience, frequency, and data will only grow,"" he wrote.
Amazon shares are up 0.7 percent in the Wednesday premarket session after the report.

 Amazon's Alexa voice technology is being used in a bunch of new hardware devices, including an upgraded Echo, a box for making phone calls and even in some upcoming BMW cars.
 To develop all of that technology, Amazon has quietly assembled a team of over 5,000 people working on Echo and the Alexa ecosystem, Amazon's hardware chief Dave Limp said during an event on Wednesday.
That's more people working on Alexa products than consumer device makers Fitbit and GoPro have combined. Fitbit has a little over 1,700 employees, while GoPro has about 1,500. 
 It's also a huge increase from last year for Alexa. In May 2016, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in an interview with Recode that there were ""more than 1,000"" people working on Alexa and Echo. 
Amazon has over 382,000 employees, so Alexa and Echo represent a tiny portion of the entire company. But rapid hiring growth reflects Amazon's willingness to invest heavily in expanding the Alexa voice platform.
That number is likely to keeping increasing. According to Amazon's jobs site, there are almost 1,500 openings for jobs related to Alexa and Echo.

Keep in mind that this is different from Echo to Echo calling, which Amazon rolled out earlier this year and works more like a conventional intercom system.

 Here's a look at five new products that Amazon just released   
 7:58  PM ET Wed, 27 Sept 2017 |  01:42 
 Amazon announced a bunch of new products on Wednesday that show that Echo and Alexa are more important than ever.
 While Amazon may have failed at the smartphone, it seems to have found incredible success with the Echo. It more than doubled down on Wednesday with five various Echo hardware products, showing the increasing importance the product has for Amazon, and its attempt to get Echos in as many households and rooms as possible.
Here's a rundown of everything Amazon introduced:
 A new Amazon Echo
 Amazon
 Amazon said it offers much better sound than the original Amazon Echo, thanks to support for Dolby Audio, which means it'll compete more directly with products such as the Sonos Play:1 and even Apple's upcoming HomePod, the latter of which is due out before the holidays. 
The new Echo is built out of metal and sports cloth around the entire body, though different shells, which can be swapped on, will be available for purchase. Google offers different colored shells for the Google Home, so this is a similar approach.
The new Echo costs $99.
 Alexa in BMW cars
 Amazon also announced that its smart voice assistant Alexa will be coming to BMW cars starting next year. This should give users full access to Alexa right from their dashboards no matter where they are.
 Amazon Echo Buttons
 Amazon
Amazon Echo Buttons used for family game night
 Amazon also unveiled tiny ""Echo Button"" devices that can be configured to work and control an Amazon Echo. In one instance, Amazon showed how a family might play a game like ""Trivial Pursuit"" using the buttons to chime in for answers. The buttons will cost $19.99 each.
 Echo Connect
 Amazon
The Amazon Echo Connect lets you use your Echos to call landlines
 The Echo Connect is a $35 box that will allow you to place phone calls to landlines or other contacts using your existing Amazon Echo units. The Echo already supports calling between Echos, but that acts more like an intercom system. Preorders for the Echo Connect begin on Wednesday.
 Amazon Echo Plus
 Amazon
The new Amazon Echo Plus, which doubles as a smart home hub
 The Amazon Echo Plus looks like the original Echo (a tall cylindrical unit) but will double as a hub for the smart home. Amazon said it will work with 100 smart home products out of the box. This means, instead of having to buy an Apple TV or a SmartThings hub, you should just be able to buy the Echo Plus as the foundation for controlling your home's lights, locks, cameras and more. The Echo Plus is priced at $149.
 New Fire TV with 4K, HDR and Dolby Atmos support
 Amazon
The new Amazon Fire TV supports 4K and HDR
 Amazon also unveiled a new Fire TV dongle that plugs into the back of a TV (it uses HDMI). It will support 4K content and high-dynamic range video (otherwise known as HDR, it allows movies and TV shows to look more as they were intended to and creates deeper blacks and brighter bright colors) and Dolby Atmos audio support.
 Echo Spot
 Amazon
The Echo Spot is like a smaller Echo Show
 The Amazon Echo Spot was also announced. It's a round version of the Echo Show and has its own 2.5-inch display that can provide visual information (such as the weather or a clock face). It also provides access to Alexa and supports optional video-calling support. The Echo Spot will cost $129 when it ships in December.

Ty Montgomery of the Green Bay Packers celebrates with fans after scoring a touchdown during the third quarter against the Seattle Seahawks at Lambeau Field on September 10, 2017 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.
 Amazon's first NFL live-stream will take place Thursday night at 8:25 PM ET/5:25 PM PT. The Green Bay Packers are hosting the Chicago Bears in an NFC North match-up.
 The game is the first of the 10 NFL matches Amazon will be streaming this year as part of a $50 million deal.
But Amazon's NFL stream isn't available to everyone — you must be an Amazon Prime member to watch it.
 Amazon Prime is a paid membership program that gives access to free two-day shipping, a bunch of online video and songs, as well as online storage space. It costs $99 a year or $10.99 a month. If you just want access to Amazon's video streaming service, it would cost $8.99 a month.
You can use this link to sign up for a free trial.
Once you're a Prime member, you'll be able to watch the game on any kind of device, including your own laptop, smartphone, or tablet. It's available on Amazon.com or through Amazon's Prime Video app.
Tonight's game marks Amazon's first step into sports live-streaming and shows the e-commerce giant's growing video ambitions. 
Amazon is expected to invest $4.5 billion in its video streaming business this year, which is slightly below Netflix's $6 billion content budget, according to JP Morgan. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said last year that the company would ""nearly double"" its investment in video, too.
And if the NFL stream turns out to be a success, expect Amazon to move into other sports categories as well. According to Manchester United's vice chairman Ed Woodward, Amazon is likely to make a strong push for a bid to win streaming rights for the English Premier League.
""Absolutely, I think they'll enter the mix. I think, anecdotally, there were strong interests in the last cycle,"" Woodward said during Manchester United's most recent earnings call, when asked about Amazon and Facebook potentially making a bid. ""We're going to see an increasing engagement from these — and we would welcome the interest.""
Amazon also released a funny ad that should get you geared up for tonight's game:

 Whole Foods CEO says Amazon helped escape high-priced image   
 7:30  PM ET Thu, 28 Sept 2017 |  00:36 
 Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods has instantly helped the high-end grocery chain shed its ""whole paycheck"" nickname, said CEO John Mackey,  according to a report in Food Business News.
 At a conference last week, Mackey said he couldn't elude the moniker and even compared himself to the magician Harry Houdini, who's best known for his sensational escape performances.
""One reason the merger came about is Whole Foods was in a trap, and I couldn't quite figure how to get out of that trap,"" Mackey said at SNAC International's Executive Leadership Forum, which Food Business news covered. ""We escaped the trap. I feel a little bit like Houdini."" 
 Mackey's comments suggest that Amazon will likely continue to cut prices at Whole Foods. Despite getting steep discounts — by as much as 43 percent– on select products in August, Whole Foods only put a 1.2 percent average price cut on the 114 products tracked by Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom one week after the deal closed.
If Amazon does cut prices broadly, some analysts believe it will help attract more more middle- and low-income consumers. That's important for Amazon, which needs to expand Prime memberships beyond higher-income households.
Mackey didn't say much about Amazon's long-term pricing plan for Whole Foods at the event. He compared it to a musician who hasn't finished writing the song, according to the report.
""We're still figuring out what we're going to do,"" Mackey said.

A customer shops for produce at a Whole Foods Market.
 One month after the Amazon-Whole Foods deal, some initial enthusiasm is wearing off, and skepticism among customers, suppliers and investors is rising.
 Early stats from inMarket, a location data research firm, shows that Whole Foods' share of visits — its stake of total grocery traffic in the US — jumped 16 percent week-over-week in the first three days after Amazon officially took over. The following week though, foot traffic was down 3.6 percent week-over-week on average.
Wall Street initially cheered the news as well, but one month on, enthusiasm has waned. Amazon shares are lower by 3 percent since the beginning of September. While much can be attributed to a broader sell-off in tech names, RJ Hottovy, analyst at Morningstar, says that investors have taken a wait-and-see attitude toward the acquisition. ""Price cuts are great, and it's brought back traffic,"" he says, ""but is it sustainable?""
 Whole Foods suppliers are also expressing mixed feelings about the deal.
Under Amazon's management, brand representatives will no longer be able to promote their products in-store at Whole Foods — a potential blow to upstart brands that use in-store reps to educate customers on new products. One supplier who works with brokers tasked with visiting local stores tells CNBC that it may move away from some broker relationships. The supplier wished to remain unnamed because it hadn't yet spoken to its partners.
Kyle Garner, CEO of Organic India, which sells teas, spices and wellness supplements in Whole Foods stores, says that a centralized model could hurt his business. Under the previous model, he says, Organic India could prove itself in one or two regions and then use the data to expand nationally. He says the changes could make it harder for up-and-coming brands to compete.
""We are a national brand, but not one of the larger ones,"" he says. ""Our ability to drive a strong relationship at the national level may be difficult.""
Lindsay Rosenberg, founder of Cherryvale Farms, has been selling to Whole Foods regionally since 2012 and is hoping to sell nationally next year. She also thinks it will become difficult for upstart brands to launch at stores under the new model.
""Whole Foods was the only place in the past we could go where we could afford to launch on a regional level. We couldn't go to a Safeway or Kroger,"" she says. But she says suppliers will find other ways. ""Young brands are going to get creative — go online or find other retail outlets that do appeal to their audience.""
Some suppliers aren't worried, however. Paddy Spence, CEO of LA-based Zevia soda brand, says the Amazon-Whole Foods partnership is providing the best of both worlds.
""Even though they're taking away local reps, the education isn't going away,"" he says. ""Whole Foods has succeeded by educating shoppers about the attributes of the products they sell, and I don't see that changing. That's what's allowed Whole Foods to succeed, and it's a big component of what's allowed Amazon to succeed.""
In a statement, the company reiterated its commitment to local suppliers.
 All Whole Foods Market stores will continue to sell local products, and our buyers remain committed to discovering and incubating local and innovative brands. Local suppliers and products are crucial to the success of the company and our ongoing work in category management helps streamline processes that ensure each store has the best possible curated selection of local and national products available for shoppers.  
Meanwhile, other supermarkets are looking for openings to steal unhappy suppliers. Earlier this month, Kroger announced plans to roll out a website aimed at luring more local brands to its stores.

 Roku CEO on IPO: Our goal is to power every TV in the world   
 1:47  PM ET Thu, 28 Sept 2017 |  04:57 
 Amazon and Apple are not a threat to streaming platform Roku, its CEO told CNBC as the company gears up to begin trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday.
 Roku aggregates different streaming providers, such as Amazon Video and Netflix, in one platform. It sells hardware that can plug into a television or licenses its software that is built into sets.
But the company has heavyweight competitors. Apple TV, for example, also allows users to access other streaming services as does Amazon's Fire TV stick.
 Anthony Wood played down the threat these tech giants posed, however.
""Roku's position in this ecosystem is being the platform that ties together the customers, the advertisers, the user, and we've been competing with big companies for a long time very successfully… we do it by winning customer reviews,"" Wood told CNBC in a TV interview Thursday.
""We have built a purpose-built operating system for TV, it is the best way to stream and that's how we get customers.""
 David Orrell | CNBC
Anthony Wood
 But while many of these video services work together, their relationship is often fraught. When Apple launched a new TV app, Netflix was not originally included in it. And earlier this week, Google pulled its YouTube video service from Amazon's Echo Show device.
When asked if he feared a similar situation could happen with Roku, Wood said that it's large scale would make that unlikely.
""I don't know why they would do that. We are the largest platform for distributing content in the United States. If you want to reach the OTT (over-the-top) audience at scale you need to be on Roku,"" Wood said.
Over-the-top content refers to streamed content over the internet.
While Wood was optimistic that the company will be able to compete in the crowded market, Roku's initial public offering (IPO) prospectus recognizes the risks posed by the titans.
""These companies have the financial resources to subsidize the cost of their streaming devices in order to promote their other products and services making it harder for us to acquire new users and increase hours streamed. These companies could also implement standards or technology that are not compatible with our products or that provide a better streaming experience on competitive products,"" the prospectus said.
 'Next generation' advertising
 Roku is loss making but the company has been growing customers and revenue. It now has 15 million monthly active accounts and generated $199.7 million in revenue during the first six months of this year, a 23 percent jump from the same period of 2016.
The company set its IPO price at $14 per share, giving the video streaming device maker a $1.3 billion stock market value when it debuts Thursday.
Advertising makes up a large chunk of Roku's profit, and this is an area where Wood sees potential for the firm.
""Advertising is our bread and butter. As the world moves to streaming, that means all TV advertising is moving to streaming. There is a huge opportunity to become the next generation advanced TV ad platform,"" Wood told CNBC.
 var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.mpsinit=mps._queue.mpsinit||[];

 });Depending on the day, and twists and turns of the news cycle, Amazon is either the greatest thing or the worst thing to happen to American businesses.
 President Donald Trump dubs Amazon a ""no-tax monopoly"" and said that it is doing ""great damage to tax-paying retailers."" He repeatedly criticized the company and its founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, throughout his presidential campaign and into his presidency.
But Linda McMahon, Trump's head of the Small Business Administration, takes a sunnier view of the internet giant. Visiting Amazon's Seattle headquarters in July, she praised the company for providing ""opportunities for small businesses,"" saying the company helps foster entrepreneurship.
 It's not just the Trump administration that's split on what Amazon means to Main Street businesses. Even small business owners don't know if Amazon is good or bad for small businesses, according to the latest CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey.
The challenges are manifest, as Amazon increasingly becomes all things to all people: bookstore, clothing retailer, grocer (through the recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market), movie producer and whatever is next. Up against Amazon's loyal and growing customer base, its low prices and fast deliveries and its wealth of analytics and consumer data, mom-and-pop stores are thought to face an existential threat.

 });
 Nonetheless, small-business owners are divided about equally on whether Amazon has a generally positive or negative effect on the climate for small businesses in the country. A little more than a third (35 percent) say what's been called the ""Everything Store"" is ""good for small businesses,"" while a few more (42 percent) still say it is ""bad for small businesses."" About 1 in 5 (21 percent) say Amazon ""has no effect on small businesses.""
 83% of business owners say they're 'not affected' by Amazon
 One big reason for the divided attitude toward Amazon is that when asked about their own business relationship to Amazon, small-business owners express little direct concern. A mere 8 percent say their business ""competes with Amazon for customers,"" with a similar proportion (7 percent) saying the internet giant ""helps drive customers"" to their business. An overwhelming 83 percent say as of yet their own business is ""not affected by Amazon.""
These results indicate that despite headlines, from the perspective of small businesses, Amazon is neither all good nor all bad — at least so far. After all, a clear majority of the 2,282 randomly selected small-businesses owners interviewed in this survey (58 percent) are members of Amazon Prime, the company's signature membership program. That's even higher than reported membership among other American adults (46 percent).
Fittingly, small-business owners who say they compete with Amazon directly are more likely to view the online retailer negatively (74 percent) and say Amazon is bad for small businesses in general. But even among this group, 54 percent subscribe to Amazon Prime, with another 27 percent making some purchases on Amazon.
More from the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey:Economic confidence slips, even among conservative business owners
On the other side, a majority (63 percent) of small-business owners who say Amazon helps drive customers to their businesses see Amazon as having a broader salutary effect. Nearly 7 in 10 (68 percent) of these small-business owners subscribe to Amazon Prime, and almost everyone else makes some purchases on the platform.
Of those small-business owners who see their businesses as helped by Amazon, 72 percent expect their revenue to increase in the next year. That optimistic view is far more entrenched than it is among those who find themselves in direct competition with Amazon (56 percent of whom see more revenue ahead) or among those who do not yet see a direct effect (50 percent).
The view across industries, however, might offer a glimpse ahead as Amazon continues its expansion. Small business owners in the retail trade — the area where Amazon began to operate as a threat way back in 1995 — take a particularly negative stance. In retail a slim majority (52 percent) call Amazon ""bad for businesses,"" far more than see it as ""good for businesses"" (31 percent). About a quarter (26 percent) of these small-business owners see themselves in direct competition with the company, the highest of any industry. Still, twice as many (52 percent) of them subscribe to Amazon Prime.
So stay tuned.

 Elon Musk issues yet another warning against runaway artificial intelligence   
 1:37  PM ET Mon, 17 July 2017 |  01:03 
 The ""really interesting project and technology that we're working on is about how to bring together these AI agents or computation agents and humans in a way that they form sort of collaborative teams to go after tasks,"" says Kurtoglu.
""What we're talking about here is more of a symbiotic team between an AI agent and a human in a way that they solve the problems together. It's not one of them tells the other one what to do, but they go back and forth. And they can formulate the problem, they can build on each other's ideas and things of that nature.""
Kurtoglu's vision is particularly relevant, as Silicon Valley leaders like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg debate the future of AI. Zuckerberg is optimistic that AI will make our lives better. Musk has threatened that AI poses a catastrophic risk to humanity and says Zuckerberg's optimistic perspective is naive.
 TWEET
 The way forward: Trust and privacy concerns remain
Kurtoglu says there are barriers to overcome on the path towards widespread partnership between humans and their artificially intelligent robot partners, namely trust and privacy.
For humans to be willing to work easily with robot assistants, the robots need to be able to tell humans how and why they arrived at decisions. Currently, that is not the case.
""We're trying to build trustable AI systems. And one way to get there is for the AI systems to be explainable,"" says Kurtoglu. ""So imagine an AI system that explains itself. So if you're using an AI agent to do medical diagnostics and it comes up with a seemingly unintuitive answer, then the doctor might want to know why, right? Why did you come up with that answer as opposed to something else? Today these systems are pretty much black boxes, so you put the input, it just spits out what the answer is.""

 ""It scares the s*** out of me,"" billionaire Mark Cuban says of AI   
 1:37  PM ET Tue, 25 July 2017 |  00:59 
 Even still, trust will come slowly for humans, says Kurtoglu, because it will require a change in behavior. That does happen, though.
""So it seems a distant past, but I remember, I remember very vividly when I first moved to the U.S. I was trying to do online shopping for travel and I was supposed to get my credit card information. And I was like, 'Should I really trust this?' because it wasn't the common way of booking,"" says Kurtoglu, who was born and raised in Turkey.
""Then I did it. I think with time, as the adoption curve goes up and whatnot, there's a certain level of trust that builds in, but I think the rate at which these algorithms are advancing now, they're going to be everywhere. I think it's going to be significant.""
 ""We're trying to build trustable AI systems. And one way to get there is for the AI systems to be explainable.""
-Tolga Kurtoglu, CEO of Silicon Valley innovation shop, PARC
 The other issue with working side-by-side with a robot the sees, listens and responds to a human is that the robot will see and listen to all of a human's behavior. That results in a loss of personal privacy and an increase in cybercrime, Kurtoglu says.
""We need to think about the signs in technology that would then make our data, our workflow, more secure and more private as well as the personal data more secure and more private,"" he says.
As artificial intelligence increasingly becomes a part of the world we live in, Kortoglu says there will always be a place for human intelligence. 
""There's still the complexity in the world. There's still those edge cases, if you will, or cases that are very, very complex, where humans are really good intuitively or experience-based to look at the situation at hand and make a judgment, where computers can't.""

 The Motor City woos Amazon for HQ2   
 8:13  AM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 |  03:31 
 As cities across the United States fight for a chance to be the home of Amazon's second headquarters, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan contended Friday on CNBC that his city has the assets envisioned by Jeff Bezos, founder of the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant.
 Although there's some great competition from other cities, the Motor City and Amazon's goals align, Duggan said on ""Squawk Box.""
""The vision that Amazon has outlined of building a headquarters woven into an urban area"" would fit the transformation that's ""happened here in the last few years,"" he added.
 Earlier this month, Amazon said it plans to open another headquarters in North America, looking for pitches from cities and states for what it calls HQ2. Amazon's current home base is in Seattle.
Detroit was one of the areas hit hardest by the Great Recession, and its unemployment was running nearly three times as high as the national average in 2009 at a staggering 28 percent.
In 2010, Quicken Loans founder and billionaire Dan Gilbert moved the company's headquarters from outside Detroit in Michigan to the urban core of the city as a part of revitalization efforts.
""Dan Gilbert and Quicken have probably bought 12,000 to 15,000 employees down here over the last four or five years, filling in office buildings, weaving an integrated community,"" Duggan said.
The Democratic Detroit mayor also said the city lost many people throughout 1970s, '80s, and '90s so there's plenty of room ""to build 8 million square feet of new office space, which is the ultimate goal and weave it into the downtown."" Amazon said it initially wants half-a-million square feet with the ability to expand to 8 million.
""It's hard to believe that three years ago we were in bankruptcy but we restructured our balance sheet. We shed our debt and we put the money in the police, in fire, in park, in services. And the results over the last few years have been unbelievable,"" Duggan said.
Quicken's Gilbert also appeared Friday on ""Squawk Box,"" saying Amazon could benefit from Detroit's proximity to Canada.
""You could have two countries right there,"" Gilbert said. ""Amazon is a transportation company to some degree. They're about the movement of goods and maybe services.""
Gilbert said he hasn't personally made a pitch to Amazon's Bezos for Detroit yet, but said going ""down the checklist"" it fits.

 });When it comes to dealing with the threat posed by Amazon, small businesses don't have to be the next David hoping to outperform Goliath — if you can't beat the giant, try joining it.
 Why? Here's one recently revealed reason: Small-business owners who say that Amazon helps drive customers to their business have more confidence than those who say their business competes with Amazon for customers, according to a new CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey. It's not by a wide margin — 59 percent vs. 56 percent, respectively. And it's also still a relatively small subset of business owners — almost equal proportions of entrepreneurs say their business competes with Amazon for customers (8 percent) or Amazon helps drive customers to their business (7 percent).
Among small-business owners, there's still a general perception about Amazon that tilts to the negative, even if they say it doesn't flow through to their actual business experience. Forty-two percent of small-business owners say Amazon is bad for small businesses, according to the survey, but a large majority (83 percent) say their business is not affected by Amazon.
 But there is a notable difference between businesses that consider Amazon a competitor and those that consider it a sales driver when it comes to revenue expectations over the next 12 months.
 In the next 12 months, do you expect your business’s revenue to increase, stay the same, or decrease?

 CNBC | SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey, Q3
 Some businesses may be missing opportunities to sell through Amazon. Amazon's Marketplace — which connects 2 million merchants with 300 million shoppers — has grown to account for more than half of all goods sold on the site.

 Becoming an Amazon seller and featuring products or service directly on Amazon can not only lead to increased sales and business confidence but also get around another issue small-business owners struggle with — their web presence. CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey data shows that only about half of all small businesses have a website. The majority of small businesses across the nation continue to rely on word of mouth to communicate with new and existing customers, the survey has found.
More from the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey:
""If you can do it, have a landing page or landing site,"" said Gabriel Shaoolian, founder and CEO of digital marketing company Blue Fountain Media. An online presence can make you visible to Google and lay out an overview of your company and values. ""But in terms of the e-commerce function, before you go off and do it on your own, have an Amazon website.""
Here are some tips for bringing Amazon' into your business, and your business onto its platform:
 1. Understand the basic fees and options before anything else. 
 To become a seller on Amazon, businesses must first determine how much they'll sell, whether it be more than 40 items a month (professional account) or fewer (individual account), according to Amazon. Professional accounts charge a monthly subscription fee of $39.99 and include referral and selling fees, while individual accounts will see Amazon charge $0.99 per sale. Businesses can also use Fulfillment by Amazon to handle shipping, other logistics and even returns.
 2. Consider making more of Amazon's might if you are in launch mode. 
 More ambitious start-ups looking to launch a brand-new product can also try applying for Amazon Launchpad, which simplifies the development, marketing and retail for new products from start-ups. It includes help in managing inventories and fulfilling orders.
The results of using Amazon can sometimes be phenomenal: South Carolina-based ornament company Palmetto Engraving received 18,000 orders from Amazon after being featured on Amazon during a Black Friday sale, said Palmetto Engraving's vice president Dennis Solomon. Until then, their biggest spike in sales were 200 orders through online retailer Etsy.
Tuft & Needle, a mattress industry disruptor, began its operations entirely online and notched 100 million in sales in 2016, said Jeff Wells of Tuft & Needle. Wells is the vice president of Amazon Strategy at the mattress disruptor, a position dedicated exclusively to managing the company's approach to selling on Amazon. A full 25 percent of the company's sales are made through Amazon; the company, in fact, lumps together the remainder of online sales because of its comparative insignificance.
 3. Be prepared to stand behind your product or service.
 To stand out in a sea of competitors, it's critical to make a good product, Wells said. Paying for advertising on Amazon will help results show up higher and shouldn't be discounted. But the Amazon dynamic also means users can leave negative feedback that can sink aspiring brands.
Here's the thing: Companies can respond to it and mitigate it but ultimately can't control it.
""There aren't any tricks,"" Wells said. Instead, concentrate on having a good product in the first place. ""It really comes down to spent time on the product first and spent time on the experience first, and everything else will follow.""
Some retailers caution against pinning everything on Amazon. Palmetto Engraving continues to grow its brand using multiple storefronts on other websites, including direct sales and Etsy. ""Why would I put all my eggs in one basket?"" Solomon said.
 4. Expect Amazon policy shifts.
 Amazon recently drew ire from online merchants for revising its refund policy to allow buyers to return items automatically, without first consulting the seller.  The decision — to more closely align independent sellers with Amazon's own customer policies — at least needs to be understood and weighed by businesses before establishing an Amazon selling relationship.
""We were able to acquire new customers who may not have found our products otherwise,"" said Brian Lim, CEO of iHeartRaves which generates $20 million a year in revenue from festival fashion sales. But Lim said Amazon is a double-edged sword. ""We were able to improve our sales from a high traffic channel. The scale of Amazon's online presence is just massive. Of course … there is a price to pay. Marketplace fees deduct a percentage of each sale, so we have to make sure our margins make sense. There's also limited control in the marketplace, since Amazon wants the focus to be on the products, rather than the sellers.""
Amazon also has suspension policies that independent sellers say are hasty, and costly. Consider the recent fate of a toothbrush parts seller who alleges Amazon cost him $200,000 after it suspended him based on an intellectual property claim from a fake law firm.

Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jamie Lannister, both among the highest paid ""Game of Thrones"" actors
 Earlier this month,  Variety reported that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos issued a mandate to the company's studio: produce more ""high-end drama series with a global appeal."" This morning, Variety reported that the company is following that order by moving forward with three major science fiction shows: adaptations of Larry Niven's Ringworld, Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, and Greg Rucka's Lazarus.
Since launching the studio in 2010, Amazon has earned considerable acclaim for its shows, such as The Man in the High Castle, Transparent, and The Grand Tour, but it seems that Bezos is setting his sights a bit higher. In an interview with Variety earlier this month, the head of Amazon Studios, Roy Price, said that Amazon is looking to create ""big shows that can make the biggest difference around the world,"" by working on shows that appeal to a global audience.
Amazon is looking for the next 'Game of Thrones'
 Price compared their efforts to trying to create the next Game of Thrones, saying that HBO's fantasy drama is akin to Jaws or Star Wars in the television world. ""Everybody wants a big hit and certainly that's the show of the moment in terms of being a model for a hit,"" he said. Variety also says that Price sent an email to Amazon employees, saying that 2018 and 2019 are shaping up to be major years for the company. ""Our overall content investment is increasing, which will allow us to continue to meet customer demand around the world for high quality and engaging programming,"" he reportedly wrote in the email.
Earlier this year, the  studio brought on former Fox executive Sharon Tal Yguado as head of event series. She was tasked with bringing major science fiction, fantasy, and horror television shows to the studio and Amazon's Prime subscribers. Amazon has dipped its toes into science fiction television  with with The Man in the High Castle,  its forthcoming anthology series Philip K. Dick's Electric Dreams, and a  pilot for a show called Oasis, which debuted earlier this year. The three shows that Amazon is developing could certainly become the same type of television juggernauts as Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, or The Handmaid's Tale, and  Variety notes that the studio is putting ""significant production investment,"" into each.
'Ringworld,' 'Snow Crash,' and 'Lazarus' are getting ""significant production investment""
Ringworld, based on the classic 1970 novel by Larry Niven, is about a man named Louis Gridley Wu who is enlisted by an alien species to participate in an expedition to locate a mysterious object in space. After crash-landing on the massive construct, he and his crew have to find a way to escape. The novel is followed by several direct sequels, and fits in Niven's much larger ""Known Space"" setting, which provides Amazon with a plenty of options for an expansive show. The Syfy Channel originally optioned the novel in 2004, and again in 2013, but nothing came of those efforts.
Snow Crashwill be an adaptation of Neal Stephenson's classic cyberpunk novel, which follows Hiro Protagonist, who delivers pizza by day and by night is a warrior in the virtual reality world Metaverse. He's sucked into a plot as a computer virus begins to infect players in the virtual world, and has to track down the people behind it. Stephenson's novel is a huge, influential work when it comes to the field of virtual reality, and with an  adaptation of Ernie Cline's novel Ready Player One on the way, Amazon seems poised to capture that interest.
Finally, Amazon also appears to be moving into the realm of comic books with an adaptation of Lazarus, based off of a comic by Greg Rucka (who helped create the CW's Supergirland Arrow,as well as Netflix's Jessica Jones). That story is about an alternate future in which the world is divided into 16 rival families, who employ a specialized assassin known as Lazarus to help stop uprisings and wars.
Amazon's efforts to level up its programming are a reaction to increased pressure within the streaming video industry to offer high-quality content to entice viewers. Yesterday, Netflix announced that it was  investing $400 million in Canadian productions over the next five years, while Hulu  recently earned its first Emmy Award for the first season of The Handmaid's Tale.

 Only thing in the way of Amazon and a trillion-dollar market cap is themselves: NYU professor   
 11:43  AM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 |  05:08 
 The pressure big U.S. tech companies are now starting to feel might be just the beginning. 
 ""The gross idolatry, or mother of all hall passes, that big tech has received from government and from regulators is coming to an end,"" NYU Stern School of Business professor Scott Galloway told CNBC's ""Squawk Alley"" on Friday. ""A perfect storm against big tech may be brewing.""
Members of Congress said this week Facebook, Google and Twitter would be pulled into Senate hearings to testify on suspected Russian intervention in the 2016 election. On Thursday Twitter provided Russia-linked ads to the congressional committee, and Facebook is expected to follow suit in the coming days. 
 ""We are barreling towards regulation,"" Galloway said. ""If you notice, a lot of senators and elected officials, their backbone is stiffening.""
While U.S. officials have turned their attention to big tech in recent weeks, Europe has been at the forefront of regulation more broadly, slapping Google with a hefty antitrust fine and putting pressure on Facebook andApple to up privacy measures. 
Greater regulation remains the only threat to a company like Amazon posting a trillion-dollar market cap, Galloway said — but the current U.S. administration might not be successful in a fight against big tech.
""If you pit the U.S. administration against Amazon,"" Galloway said, Amazon comes out on top. ""The collective IQ of the administration right now versus Amazon is woefully undermatched.""

Roku TV
 Roku just announced updates to five of its TV streaming products, as well as a new operating system that marries access to over-the-air TV with video streaming services. The announcements from Roku are coming just after  both Apple and  Amazon have revealed updates to their own video streaming boxes, with all three companies pushing further into the home with things like 4K, voice control, and improved search functionality.
Roku's low-cost streaming sticks are getting the most interesting updates. The basic Roku streaming stick, which at $49.99 is priced the same as last year's, is getting a processor update that Roku claims is 50 percent faster. The remote is also getting voice control functionality, as well as power and volume buttons to control those functions on your TV set.
Then there's the Roku Streaming Stick Plus, which now supports HDR and 4K Ultra HD. It also has four times the wireless range of the basic stick, which is partly enabled by the wireless module being built directly into the cable rather than the stick itself; the idea being that moving it away from the television reduces interference. This one, which effectively replaces last year's Roku Premiere 4K box, will cost $69.99.
 The tiny Roku boxes, the Roku Express and Roku Express Plus, are also getting processor updates, but selling for the same price — $29.99 for the Roku Express, and $10 more for a model that connects with composite ports, on older TVs.
The bigger Roku box, the Roku Ultra, isn't getting any significant hardware changes, but at $99 is less than the $130 starting price point it had last year. This is the highest-end Roku, with support for 4K at 60fps and HDR10, an ethernet port and USB support, a ""Find My Remote"" feature, private listening on the remote, and now, power and volume buttons on the remote as well.
Roku's lower starting price point for its top-of-the-line streaming box undercuts the  new Apple TV, which also offers 4K support and HDR but starts at $179. It's still more expensive than Amazon's newest Fire TV device, which again, supports 4K and HDR but  only costs $70.
But Roku — which has been around for fifteen years and  just had its first day of trading on the public stock market last week — has always insisted that its agnostic approach to streaming content is what sets is apart, as well as its multitude of channels. Unlike Apple TV and Amazon, Roku doesn't have a content platform (or make its own original content) that it feels compelled to prioritize over, say, Hulu, or HBO Go. And Roku boasts that it now offers more than 5000 streaming channels on its sticks, boxes, and TV sets, which is kind of an absurd number of channels, but also means there's a lot of niche stuff people can watch if they want.
Roku also announced a new operating system today, Roku OS 8. There are a few new handy shortcuts to access videos, but the biggest changes have to do with the way the OS now integrates programming from over-the-air TV (Roku says it's capitalizing on the growing trend of antenna-based TV watching).
So when you search for programming like ""This Is Us,"" both streaming results and live TV results will show on the same page. In recent years, Roku has rolled out ""private listening"" for its streaming videos, letting you plug headphones into the remote or mobile app to listen to whatever you're streaming; now, with OS 8, private listening will also be available for over-the-air TV on Roku.
And Roku is adding single sign-on for paid TV customers, with support of about 30 TV channels to start. This is something that Apple introduced back in 2016, with the rollout of its iOS 10 and tvOS 10 software.
Roku OS 8 is a free update and will roll out across Roku boxes, sticks, and partner TV sets (like Roku's TCL TV) throughout October and November, Roku said. Some older streaming boxes won't get the update, though.

 });It's no secret that Amazon is the master of customer convenience and (almost) instant gratification. But with their most recent initiative that allows customers to order online and pick up in stores (within an hour), the company continues to force small businesses to rethink the local shopping experience. Local businesses must continually reevaluate how they can attract and retain customers with Amazon encroaching on some of their space.
 So what's the answer for small businesses trying to survive in the Age of Amazon? Focus on coexisting with the online retail giant instead of competing. After all, with 92 percent of retail sales still happening in brick-and-mortar stores, these small and local retailers have a huge opportunity to maintain and grow their business by keeping shoppers buying local.
To do this, they need to understand that buying patterns and customer preferences have changed. Buying ads in the Sunday paper or purchasing a local TV spot simply aren't going to drive the same results they did 10 years ago. To coexist with Amazon, small businesses need to get more creative in reaching customers, starting with the basics. Here are some key ways to welcome new customers and keep them coming back.
 Forget the printed yellow pages — own your online voice
 In today's largely digital world, it's shocking that almost half (45 percent) of small-business owners say they still don't even have a website, according to the CNBC/SurveyMonkey Small Business Survey. Years ago, if a company wasn't listed in the yellow pages, you'd assume they didn't exist or that they'd gone out of business. Today's digitally-savvy customers are researching options online and using search, various content sites and social media to direct them to a storefront. Small businesses should think of the company's presence across this local ecosystem, combined with their own website, as their ""digital door,"" and they need to ensure that their messaging, products and company details are clearly accessible to shoppers.
Today most buyers will never come through your physical door unless they've first gone through your digital door and judged you worthy of a visit.

 });
 Use reviews and location to your advantage
 Once you've conquered your online listing, the next step is modernizing your digital presence by paying attention to online listings and nurturing your reputation in reviews. According to a survey done by BrightLocal, ""74 percent of consumers say that positive reviews make them trust a local business more."" As such, local businesses need to cultivate a strong review network, ensuring happy customers share their experience and any negative reviews are addressed in a timely manner. Minimally, just being aware of what customers are saying about you can make a world of difference in what changes you make to your business.
Local businesses also have a huge opportunity to capture ""on-the-go"" shoppers. ""Near Me"" searches on the top search engines are becoming more popular (up 146 percent year-over-year, according to GeoMarketing) when mobile shoppers are looking for a product or service locally. As a first step, business owners can invest in capabilities like search marketing — activating functions like Google Location Extensions and geo-targeting to ensure they appear in these searches and capturing high-intent, mobile shoppers.

 Understand your potential allies
 Ever heard the phrase, ""If you can't beat them, join them?"" If your products are the types of things that are sellable in Amazon's environment (i.e. consumer products, more modes price points, easy to understand and merchandise digitally), joining the Amazon marketplace can be extremely helpful for growing your business and getting your feet wet in e-commerce. However, online selling means that your business will be very different. You will need to take a hard look at the complete financial impact of selling through a third party like Amazon, adopt shipping and return procedures and plan for the changes among staff and business process that go along with it. Is your business prepared to take on these initiatives? If so, this is something to think about as you look to attract more digital shoppers.
Additionally, many retailers don't realize that their brand partners often set aside a significant amount of marketing dollars for co-op marketing subsidies with their retailer networks. You can work with your product brand partners to determine if these subsidies are available and, if so, use them to help pay for any marketing efforts where that brand is present. Just ensure you account for all of their brand guidelines in the marketing execution so that you maximize the financial benefit and don't get caught expecting a reimbursement for which you aren't eligible.
While Amazon is clearly an 800-pound gorilla in the retail space, small businesses have an advantage they'll never have. Many small retailers have been a part of their communities for generations and are a key pillar of the local economy. People have a desire to support businesses in their own communities, and you have an opportunity to connect with them in a different way by getting that message out.
Amazon has undoubtedly thrown a curve ball into traditional buying models, but the company is here to stay, so it's time for small businesses to learn how to coexist. With a larger focus on aligning online and offline initiatives to meet the needs and preferences of today's consumers, small businesses will be positioned to thrive in this new era of retail.

 What will be the first native app that taps into the power of the blockchain, cryptocurrencies and tokens?
 That's the provocative question posed last week by venture capital investor Chris Dixon and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam in Andreessen Horowitz's tech podcast ""Why Crypto Tokens Matter.""
Although the extreme hype around blockchain and cryptocurrency today attracts hucksters and scammers, Dixon and Ehrsam argue that the significance of the rise of cryptocurrencies is undeniable.
 The analogy they use to explain the significance is this: in the way that the web allowed for the programmability of information for the first time, cryptocurrencies and tokens allow for the programmability of money or value for the first time.
The development of the web allowed for new businesses operating at a global scale which the world had never seen before. They believe cryptocurrencies will offer the same potential.
However, Amazon didn't become a $500 billion business overnight. It's taken over 20 years to get to its current size. Dixon and Ehrsam argue that it required the development of a whole ecosystem around Amazon and other web companies – including web servers, databases, logistics, and payment systems – for them to maximize their potential. There will be the same need for a massive build out in infrastructure for cryptocurrencies and tokens to reach the same potential.
But the most intriguing idea in the podcast  is how both Dixon and Ehrsam agree that the companies which have the greatest chance to capture the most value with every big wave of technology – such as web, mobile, and now crypto – are the ones who ""burn the boats"" to yesterday's technology and go all-in on being the first native app for the new wave.
For instance, Amazon set the example when it came to native web apps for e-commerce. Unlike Barnes & Noble, they didn't try to keep one foot in traditional retail with their brick-and-mortar stores and one in the web world. They showed the world what a total focus on e-commerce looked like.
The mobile-only world arrived 10 years ago with the unveiling of the Apple iPhone. However, the initial mobile apps were modeled after websites – cramming a large amount of data fit for a web page on to a tinier mobile screen. Flickr was the dominant photo site in 2007. It created a mobile app for itself but still was geared to you going to your computer and uploading photos.
It wasn't until Instagram came along when the world saw what a mobile-only photo app looked like. For a long time, there wasn't even a webpage for Instagram. Users flocked to it, and Facebook bought it for what seems like a bargain price of $1 billion in 2012. It's still the dominant photo-sharing app today
 What this business might look like
 So what will be the first ""blockchain-only"" native business?
Dixon and Ehrsam don't have any predictions of what that business will be or when it will arrive. But it's helpful to think about what such a business could look like, if you're an investor like me and interested in keeping your eyes open to find out what to look for.
To me, what's most interesting about the whole advent of cryptocurrencies in the past year is Etheruem and how it allows for ""smart contracts"" to program the relationship of money between parties. The basic idea is that, if something happens, then someone should get paid automatically. You can imagine intricate conditional patterns that allow for people to be generate value for themselves automatically while stripping out a bunch of intermediaries which have existed up until now taking out a toll at every step along the way. The businesses that can pop up, go after big markets, and put these old intermediaries out of business should have a big leg up on future competition.
Here are some ideas of possible businesses to look for in the years ahead (and invest in if you're lucky):
 The first all-blockchain insurance company that only issues policies in smart contract form. Human futures. On my recent podcast with Balaji Srinivasan, he spoke about the company Upstart. It was founded a few years ago with the idea of actually allowing you to invest in an individual's potential future income stream. You could decide to lend to them based on their background and ask for a share in their upside career (almost like an agent). Smart contracts would make that business model feasible. Upstart pivoted away from that model a few years ago but it will be possible in the future. We already have have online law firms like LegalZoom which allow you to more easily incorporate your business for example. What about a law service only focused on creating smart contracts without a lot of expensive overhead of top laywers running around billing by the hour? Why not a LinkedIn career service focused on matching short-term gigs that tap in to your specific expertise and pay you in some cryptocurrency? The first institutional investment bank allowing only blockchain-based trading of securities with immediate settlement. They could also finally crack the IPO code for the perfect ""dutch auction"" of new issues with a perfect matching of buyers and sellers to the optimal amount of money raised goes to the issuer, instead of the investment banking clients. The first blockchain-based rewards system that rewards participants with special offers if they allow advertisers see when they perform certain tasks or reach certain levels. The first blockchain-based mortgage lender or credit card issuer. With the whole Equifax scandal of the past few weeks, why not a blockchain-based (hyper secure) credit bureau to replace the status quo credit bureaus of today with a promise of better confidentiality and better credit information? 
 We need to get beyond the Jamie Dimon type of discussion about bitcoin being a fraud or the speculative bubble around cryptocurrencies. Instead, we need to look at the underlying technology around these currencies, especially smart contracts that are programmable and enforceable. These contracts will allow for many new disruptive businesses to be formed on top of them.
If you find the first new ""native app"" to be built on top of the blockchain in a big product category, it's likely that you'll find an attractive long-term investment.

 Oracle CEO: Autonomous database perhaps biggest announcement ever in the space   
 11:34  AM ET Mon,  2 Oct 2017 |  03:47 
 Oracle CEO Mark Hurd said he's not worried ""so much"" about Amazon Web Services, the leading public cloud provider, in an interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt on ""Squawk Alley"" on Monday.
 ""You know, to be honest with you, they have salespeople out there, but I don't really worry so much about them, to be very blunt with you,"" said Hurd, whose company is currently holding its annual OpenWorld conference in San Francisco. ""We need to worry about ourselves. We're in a great position.""
Oracle trailed Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and IBM in the cloud infrastructure services market — including cloud infrastructure, platform as a service and hosted private cloud — in the second quarter, according to Synergy Research.
 Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief technology officer and board chairman, on Sunday evening, boasted that Oracle's cloud infrastructure could do certain computations faster and more cheaply than the market-leading Amazon Web Services public cloud. In addition to pushing its cloud infrastructure, the company is also emphasizing the importance of its cloud-based applications, and it recently chose to only give certain compensation to its top executives if it met goals around cloud growth.
""I think in the end we have different competitors in different parts of our business,"" Hurd said. ""Amazon has been a competitor mostly on the infrastructure layer."" 
Both provide infrastructure for hosting applications, but AWS also has cloud-based database software that competes with Oracle's. 
 Last month Oracle reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter that ended on Aug. 31, but the stock fell after the company disclosed its guidance for the next quarter. 
Hurd also talked up the importance of the latest version of the company's database software.
The Oracle Database 18c software handles the job of managing itself and expanding itself to more server infrastructure, so humans don't need to do that. The database also automatically does the work of updating itself with patches, which can prevent outsiders from exploiting security vulnerabilities. 
""I'd argue this announcement you just described, which is autonomous database, is perhaps the biggest announcement ever in the database market -- certainly the biggest announcement we've made in -- perhaps ever, certainly in years,"" Hurd said.

 Amazon is expected to generate roughly $4.3 billion in sales this year from its growing army of private label products, according to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's Youssef Squali.
 That's in part boosted by the Whole Foods acquisition, which Squali estimated to add roughly $700 million in sales with its own list of private label products, including 365Everyday Value, Whole Foods Market, and Whole Paws, which are now sold on Amazon.com.
Amazon has been ramping up its private label offerings in recent years. It now sells its own products across a number of different categories, including electronics, baby products, and fashion. Squali noted that 20 of the 27 brands owned by Amazon — excluding Whole Foods-owned products — have been created over the past two years alone. 
 By 2022, Amazon should get roughly $20 billion in revenue from its private label products, accounting for about 5 percent of total sales, he added.
""One of the highly underappreciated trends within Amazon is the rise of private labels, which should give the company a strong competitive advantage overtime,"" Squali wrote.
The growth in private label sales helps Amazon in a number of different ways. It gives Amazon more visibility into what products are most in demand, and better control over the supply chain. It also helps Amazon's profitability, because private label products have higher margins. Squali believes it could help bring down prices of competing products as well since they're mostly offered at a lower price — which would drive customer loyalty to Amazon.com too.
The bulk of Amazon's private label sales will come from electronic devices. Over 70% of private label sales are expected to come from devices like the Echo, Fire TV, and Kindle, he wrote. But apparel and fashion is the fastest growing category as Amazon launched 9 new fashion brands in 2017 alone, and 17 since 2016.
""We estimate that Apparel sales on Amazon will account for ~2% of overall private label sales but will grow at very robust triple digit pace over the next few years,"" Squali wrote.

 Amazon has acquired Body Labs, a start-up that specializes in 3D body scanning and modeling, according to TechCrunch.
 The report cited two sources familiar with the matter. One said Amazon spent between $50 million and $70 million in the deal and the other said it could be over $100 million. Body Labs has raised over $10 million so far and was last valued at roughly $30 million, according to Pitchbook.
Body Labs, founded in 2013, offers 3D body modeling technology, according to its website. The company helps apparel retailers make better size recommendations for customers and reduce the number of returns.
 The acquisition is another sign of Amazon's growing ambition in the fashion space. The e-commerce giant has launched nine new fashion brands in 2017 and 17 since last year. It's also released the Echo Look, a device that gives fashion recommendations, and a new service called Amazon Wardrobe that lets Prime members try on clothes before purchasing.
Amazon's representative wasn't immediately available for comment.

Jeff Bezos
 Josh Umbehr, a Kansas-based family physician and entrepreneur, is on a mission to bring down the price of health care, starting with prescription drugs. 
 So for years, he's been regularly emailing the one person that he believes can make a difference.
And that's Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. 
 ""Amazon could work with small pharmacies across the country to provide a huge value to Prime customers, on a regular basis (with) short delivery times, not to mention the effect it would have on competition that over charges immensely,"" one of Umbehr's emails to Bezos suggests. 
Umbehr says he has contacted Bezos about every other week for several years, and forwarded about half-a-dozen of these emails on request. 
""I love Jeff,"" he said. ""I would s--- a brick if he ever got back to me.""
While Bezos has never personally responded, Umbehr's hopes soared when an Amazon employee got back to him encouraging him to submit a business proposal. 
Amazon also wrote that he would hear from the company if his ideas ""contributed to Amazon's business goals.""
But in January 2017, Umbehr received his most detailed response informing him that his email had been forwarded along to Amazon's business development team. ""Jeff has empowered talented people on this team to work closely with and make strategic decisions about these issues,"" the email reads. 
 Amazon's push into the drug supply chain
 Josh Umbehr 
Josh Umbehr from Atlas MD
 CNBC reported in May that Amazon was looking to hire a general manager to lead its potential push into pharmacy, a multibillion market. It also has brought on dozens of health and medical workers for a variety of health-related business units. 
Some experts have speculated that Amazon could step into the space by focusing on those who opt to pay cash, rather than to use insurance. One such insider is Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, who has previously suggested that Amazon could support the growing number of people who are willing to pay out-of-pocket for cheap generic drugs. 
For Umbehr, this strategy makes sense as the drug supply chain offers very little transparency into the actual cost of medicines. 
When he's not emailing Amazon, Umbehr dedicates his time to his direct primary care practice, Atlas MD, which provides cash-only medical services like discounted drugs. He started the group in 2010, and has grown in to 3,000 patients who are willing to pay between $10 and $100 a month for unlimited work visits, home visits and procedures. 
Amazon would potentially compete with businesses like his, but Umbehr said he wouldn't mind. 
""I welcome the direct competition,"" he said. ""We need a national health care solution to this problem.""

 Tech's four horsemen more like Darth Vader or Ayn Rand: NYU's Scott Galloway   
 9:17  AM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  01:22 
 The following is an excerpt from ""The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google"" (Oct. 3, 2017, Portfolio) by Scott Galloway:
 Firms try to build higher and higher walls to keep enemies (upstarts and competitors) from invasion. Business theorists call these structures ""barriers to entry.""
They are nice in theory, but increasingly traditional walls are showing cracks, even crumbling — especially in tech. The plummeting price of processing power (Moore's Law again), coupled with an increase in bandwidth and a new generation of leadership that has digital in their DNA, has produced bigger ladders than anyone ever expected. ESPN, J.Crew, and Jeb Bush . . . all unassailable, no? No. Digital ladders (over-the-top video, fast fashion, and @therealdonaldtrump) can vault almost any wall.
 So, what's a ridiculously successful firm to do? Malcolm Gladwell, the Jesus of business books, highlights the parable of David & Goliath to make the key point: don't fight on other people's terms. In other words, once you've made the jump to light speed as a tech firm, you need to immunize yourself from the same conquering weapons your own army levied on the befuddled prey. There are several obvious examples: network effects (everyone is on Facebook because . . . everyone's on Facebook); IP protection (every firm in tech over $10 billion is suing, and being sued by, every other $10 billion tech firm), and developing an industry standard—monopoly—ecosystem (typing this on Word because I have no choice).
However, I'd argue that digging deeper moats is the real key to long-term success.
The iPhone will not be the best phone for long. Too many firms are struggling to catch up. However, there is a key asset of Apple Inc. that has a stronger immune system: its 492 retail stores in 19 countries. Wait, a marauder could just put up an online store, no? No. HP.com vs. the Apple Regent Street Store in London is like bringing a (butter) knife to a gunfight. And even if Samsung decides to allocate the capital, nine women can't have a baby in a month and the Korean giant would need a decade (at least) to present a similar offering.
Brick and mortar's troubles have been laid at the feet of digital disruption. There is some truth to that. However, digital sales are still only 10–12 percent of retail. It's not stores that are dying, but the middle class, and the stores serving them. Most that are located in, or serving, middle-class households are struggling. By comparison, stores in affluent neighborhoods are holding strong. The middle class used to be 61 percent of Americans, now they are the minority, representing less than half the population . . . the rest being lower or upper income.
 So, Apple, recognizing that ladders will keep getting taller, opted for more analog (time/ capital expensive) moats. Google and Samsung are both coming for Apple. But they are more likely to produce a better phone than to replicate the romance, connection, and general awesomeness of Apple's stores. So, every successful firm in the digital age needs to ask: In addition to big, tall walls, where can I build deep moats? That is, old-economy barriers that are expensive and take a long time to dredge (and for competitors to cross). Apple has done this superbly, continually investing in the world's best brand, and in stores. Amazon, also is going for moats, erecting a hundred-plus expensive and slow‑to‑get-built warehouses. How old economy! A good bet is Amazon will open thousands before they are done.
Recently Amazon announced leases on twenty 767s and purchased thousands of Amazon-branded tractor-trailers. Google has server farms, and is launching early twentieth-century aviation technology (blimps) into the atmosphere that will beam broadband down to Earth. Facebook, among the Four Horsemen, has the fewest old-economy moats, making it the most vulnerable to an invading army with big-ass ladders. You can expect that to change as Facebook announced they, along with Microsoft, are laying cable across the floor of the Atlantic.
The success of single companies like Apple can hollow out entire markets, even regions. The iPhone debuted in 2007, and devastated Motorola and Nokia. Together they have shed 100,000 jobs. Nokia, at its peak, represented 30 percent of Finland's GDP and paid almost a quarter of all of that country's corporate taxes. Russia may have rolled tanks into Finland in 1939, but Apple's 2007 commercial invasion also levied substantial economic damage. Nokia's fall pummeled the entire economy of Finland. The firm's share of the stock market has shrunk from 70 to 13 percent.

 NYU Professor Scott Galloway says despite the awesome power of what he calls the Four Horsemen — Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google — their survival isn't assured, especially given the competition they face with one another.
 Galloway's new book, ""The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google,"" out today, is no fawning tribute, criticizing the Four Horseman on taxes, privacy and jobs. 
I called Galloway to ask what will happen with these four companies.
 His answer: it will be a battle of the giants, with all four pitted against each other. ""At least two or three now compete in each other's markets, whether it's advertising, music, books, movies, social networks, cell phones — or lately, autonomous vehicles,"" he said.
Will they all survive? Given the awesome power of these companies, Galloway is surprisingly reticent to say yes. The one exception may be Apple, which stands alone as a luxury brand and which presents the advantage of fatter margins and a competitive edge. Here he feels comfortable making a prediction: ""Only Apple has the potential to cheat death.""
Galloway says if he were advising Amazon (he's not) he would tell them they should spin off Amazon Web Services. ""It would increase value and keep regulators at bay for another couple of years,"" he says.
Some companies might be able to challenge the internet giants. Galloway goes through the usual suspects — Alibaba, Tesla, Uber, Airbnb, even Wal-Mart — and concludes that of the big guys, Airbnb has the best shot.
He believes Airbnb's market capitalization (now $31 billion) will surpass Uber's (now $70 billion) by the end of 2018. (For the record, Amazon and Facebook are each around $500 billion in market value, while Google's parent Alphabet is around $660 billion and Apple is inching toward $800 billion.)
Still, he concludes it's going to be tough to beat the Four Horsemen. They have the advantages in products, markets, stock valuation, recruiting, and management. ""That makes it unlikely they will lose their current dominance for a (human) generation or more (famous last words),"" he says.
That sarcastic close is warranted: Galloway is too smart to say never: ""[A]t some kitchen table or a booth at Starbucks, a start-up team,led by the next Steve Jobs, is plotting a new enterprise that could streak past the horsemen to become the first 1-T [$1 trillion] corporation,"" he says.
Time will tell whether the public will grow weary of the dominance of these companies, much as we admire them. Galloway thinks the recent investigation into Russian meddling in the election, with Facebook at the center, could be a turning point for the public's endless admiration.
""[W]e are barreling toward regulation,"" he said on our air last week. ""If you notice, a lot of senators and elected officials - their backbone is stiffening around these very serious issues that some of these platforms have been weaponized to undermine our democracy...This could be a huge shift in the public and government's perception and treatment of these companies.""
What's coming could at the very least be ""the mother of all fines"" for any or all of these companies. He thinks the big battle will be fought in the European Union, which this year fined Facebook $129 million over its takeover of WhatsApp and Google $2.7 billion over anti-trust rules.
""These countries register all of the down side, and a fraction of the upside benefits,"" from these companies, he told me, adding he thinks it is just the beginning. ""You will see a $10 billion-plus fine come out of Europe.""

 We are letting Amazon and Apple 'avoid taxes, invade privacy, and destroy jobs,' says NYU professor   
 1:32  PM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  00:46 
 Scott Galloway is one angry guy.  He's a professor at the NYU Stern School of Business, where he teaches brand strategy and digital marketing, and he's the founder of consulting firm L2. Galloway has become a bit of a media star recently on his (accurate) prediction that Amazon should consider buying Whole Foods.  You might think his new book, ""The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google,"" out Tuesday, would be an admiring examination of how these companies came to dominate the world.  On one level, it is. He explains how the tech giants have succeeded in exerting influence over our attention, our loyalty and our personal information.  ""Facebook and Google own media; Apple owns the phone; and Amazon is about to molest the entire retail ecosystem,"" he says.  Fair enough, but that's not really what Galloway has set out to do. Galloway is upset, really upset, at what he says these companies are getting away with: ""These companies avoid taxes, invade privacy and destroy jobs to increase profits because ... they can.""  He's angry that the ""Four Horsemen"" — as he calls them — employ only 418,000 employees, about the population of Minneapolis, but they have a combined stock market value ($2.3 trillion) that is roughly the GDP of France, a developed nation of 67 million citizens.  He's angry that these companies create growth without prosperity. He knows that many people tend to blame global trade and immigrants for our problems, but he insists the tech economy and its ""fetishization"" is equally to blame: ""It's dangerous for our society, and it shows no signs of slowing down. It hollows out the middle class, which leads to bankrupt towns, feeds the angry politics of those who feel cheated, and underpins the rise of demagogues.""  It's not just that he doesn't like what these companies are doing. He also doesn't particularly like a lot of the people who run these companies. Doubt me? Here's a sample:  On the obsession with Apple founder Steve Jobs: ""Steve Jobs, in my view, spat on the universe. ... The world needs more homes with engaged parents, not a better ... phone.""  On Apple's tax history: ""Apple is the largest tax avoider in the history of U.S. business.""  On the parallels between Google and Microsoft: ""Microsoft at its peak was notorious for having the most insufferable a------ employees in American business.""  On why rich people are easier to sell to because they're all basically alike: ""Rich people are more homogenous than any other cohort on Earth. ... The global elite, by contrast, is a rainbow of the same damn color."" On what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos should really be doing with his company: ""What's clear is that we need business leaders who envision, and enact, a future with more jobs — not billionaires who want the government to fund, with taxes they avoid, social programs for people to sit on their couches and watch Netflix all day."" Gee, thanks Scott. What is this? New Progressive? Intellectual Populism? Old-fashioned trust busting? Trump-era name calling?
 Amazon declined comment on Galloway's book. Apple did not immediately return a call for comment.  In a phone interview, Galloway describes himself as an ""irreverent progressive,"" telling me, ""I'm a capitalist, but I'm smart enough to realize that idolatry of these firms are not going to take care of us when we are old. They are just here to make a profit. ""  And what's wrong with that? Nothing, he insists, but then goes on: ""We reward them with characteristics associated with kindness and generosity,"" none of which is true, he says. ""They are being given the mother of all hall passes. We think these companies are progressive, when their behavior is more like Darth Vader crossed with Ayn Rand.""  Galloway is seizing on a new zeitgeist that is starting to emerge, a new narrative about these companies, one that switches from gushing admiration to a more critical viewpoint of their impact on the rest of the world, what exactly we have all given up to them, and what we have really received in return.  Do they deserve such criticism? Galloway argues that their sheer size and influence demands that we be more critical toward them. Let's just focus on Amazon for the moment. He is amazed at:  1) The trust Amazon's consumer shows toward Amazon: ""Amazon's customers trust it so much that they're allowing the company to listen in on their conversations and harvest their consumption data. This will give Amazon deeper penetration into the private lives and desires of consumers than any other company.""  2) The way Wall Street gives a pass to Amazon: ""Amazon has trained the Street to hold them to a different standard — to expect higher growth but lower profits.""  3) The stunning success of Amazon Prime: ""Prime members represent recurring revenue, loyalty and annual purchases that are 40 percent greater than non-Prime members.""  4) How Amazon has made shipping the pillar of its success: ""In 2015, Amazon spent $7 billion on shipping fees, a net shipping loss of $5 billion, and overall profits of $2.4 billion. Crazy, no?""  Not crazy, of course. A critical key to Amazon's success was the development of the world's most efficient physical distribution network. Lower costs, greater selection, faster delivery. Get to more and more households in less and less time.  Galloway's conclusion: Amazon is on a path to a trillion-dollar market cap (currently at $460 billion), through a combination of acquisitions, a further push into the last-mile delivery chain and opening more stores. Galloway spends considerable time explaining this oddity, why Amazon, the store killer, will expand into bricks and mortar: ""Because e-commerce doesn't work, isn't economically viable, and no pure e-commerce firm will survive long term.""  What's Amazon's next move? Galloway got considerable buzz a short while ago when he suggested that Nordstrom would be a logical acquisition (they are in talks to go private). But he suggests they are so big they could buy almost anything: ""My bet is Amazon buys the rights to broadcast March Madness or the Super Bowl to juice their Prime membership ... as they can.""  The real move to get them to a $1 trillion market cap, Galloway predicts, will be in artificial intelligence: ""If Amazon tests an AI-like offering anticipating all your retail needs — sending stuff automatically and calibrating based on what you send back or edit via voice ... the stock will become antigravity matter and triple to a trillion dollars in value.""  What about the competition? Is it all over for retail? No, Galloway says. He cites a small group of innovators — Sephora, Home Depot, Best Buy — that are investing in people and a strong in-store experience.

 Amazon looking for physical stores in France   
 1:31  PM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  01:06 
 Online giant Amazon is on the prowl for approximately 15 store locations in France, especially in Paris, in the next two years, according to the newspaper Le Monde.
 The French publication also said that the U.S. company has ""approached French distributors to forge partnerships or make an acquisition in France."" The overall goal in mind for Amazon is ""to get closer to a retailer to take advantage of its buying capacity that they do not have at the moment,"" Le Monde said.
The newspaper said Amazon was in discussions with two independent food distribution companies in France.
 ""They have approached everyone but have not received any positive feedback,"" said a distributor quoted by the paper.
According to the report, one of those approached was major French retail chain Monoprix, whose parent company is Groupe Casino. But it indicated that Casino said it ""does not intend to sell Monoprix.""
Amazon declined to comment in response to a request from CNBC.
The new stores in France could be used to perhaps expand the company's Amazon Go grab-and-go concept. The idea is currently in a private beta test with only Amazon employees and located around the corner from the company's headquarters in Seattle.
Similarly, the French paper said Amazon is looking for partnerships in Britain and already approached the Morrisons grocery chain.
In February, the U.K.'s  Sunday Times newspaper carried a report that Amazon was looking for store locations in central London to launch Amazon Go. At the time, the Times said ""the move suggests it is stepping up plans to bring futuristic convenience stores to Britain.""
Amazon Go features a high-tech platform that allows consumers to purchase items without ever waiting in lines. The checkout process is done automatically through the customer's smartphone.
The Amazon Go store now in beta test is smaller then regular supermarkets. It was launched before Amazon purchased Whole Foods Market, the organic and natural food products chain.
Meantime, Amazon still gets the bulk of its sales from the North American market but has been aggressively expanding its operations overseas. The company already has more than 30 fulfillment centers in the European Union and last year announced plans to expand its workforce in Europe above 41,000 people.
Besides online services, Amazon also has a dozen research and development facilities in Europe, including teams to develop its Alex personal assistant and drone delivery service.

 Amazon will be hit with a fine for unpaid back taxes on Wednesday, the Financial Times said Tuesday.
 The European Union is contending that Amazon used Luxembourg as a tax haven and that it had established unfair partnerships with the country in an effort to skirt European taxes on 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) in royalties. Such moves were seen as unfair by rivals, the FT said. The level of the fine was not reported.
An Amazon spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
 The news follows on the heels of a new EU tax plan that would prevent American companies such as Amazon, Apple and others from using certain tax loopholes. One reason these have been used, however, is that companies feel the taxes on repatriating money earned overseas back to the U.S. is taxed at too high of a rate.
The European Union has been chasing down American companies. In June, the EU fined Google 2.4 billion euros for unfairly dominating the search and advertising market. It also fined Apple 13 billion euros plus back taxes after the EU argued that Ireland granted tax benefits to Apple.

 });Tophatter is an e-commerce retailer that sees itself as the anti-Amazon. While that gigantic online marketplace is where shoppers turn to buy what they need, Tophatter focuses more on what consumers didn't know they wanted.
 Pulling up the app is like stepping into the world's busiest discount mall. Act now! Deals won't last! Users compete in 90-second ""flash"" auctions where sellers are hawking everything from teeth-whitening kits to rare coins. It's as if QVC appeared on your smartphone as a video game. That ""gorgeous 18K white-gold-filled faux-diamond ring"" has 55 bids and is going, going ..."" Bam! You bought it!
""We're all about discovery shopping,"" says Andrew Blachman, Tophatter's chief operations officer. ""You come to us without a particular purchase in mind but leave with, say, a great refurbished laptop or a new watch that's 80 percent off retail value."" Most customer purchases are between $10 and $20.
 For many the experience is addictive. The company has 12 million registered users, mostly in the United States, and 2 million items are sold each month. Blachman anticipates 2017 sales will range between $300 million and $350 million on transactions of roughly $1 million each day. The company estimates it will make $100 million in revenue this year, up from around $40 million in 2016. The phone app, where most users interact with the platform, has more than 10 million downloads. All that makes investors the happiest auction winners of all.

""It's going to the bazaar or market, like we've been doing for hundreds of years, but bringing it to a mobile app in a super-compelling way,"" says Eric Kim, managing partner of Goodwater Capital, a major Tophatter backer, along with August Capital and CRV. The company has raised $35 million since launching in 2011. ""At a time when people say retail is dying and the mall is dead, these guys have figured out a way to get customers shopping again.""
 Offering the personal touch
 Although nonstop lightning deals can feel overwhelming at first, the platform restrains how much merchandise is up for bids. ""We don't sell everything all the time,"" says Blachman. ""Rather, we only list a certain number of sellers, and we're strict about who we let post and sell."" As on sites like Amazon and eBay, the review and report system (mostly) weeds out sellers who don't deliver as promised. If an item doesn't arrive or isn't as described, Tophatter will issue a refund.
Tophatter also uses an algorithm to personalize recommendations. Buyers who bid on designer shoes will see more fashion items on the landing page the next time they sign in. The company takes a piece of each sale — and a high one; it is in the double-digit range for every purchase.
Not that it's easy profiting on all those discount drones, makeup kits and curling irons. Auction sites struggle to compete with established names, like Amazon and eBay. One of the largest online auction start-ups, Auctionata, went out of business earlier this year after having raised $97 million.

 ""As Amazon grows, there's less and less room for broad e-commerce sites that act as middlemen between buyers and sellers,"" says Zoe Leavitt, senior intelligence analyst at CB Insights. One area of growth appears to be niche auction sites, Leavitt says, pointing to recent funding deals for car auction sites, including Mychebao.com in China, with $233 million in total funding, and TradeRev in Canada, with $45 million.
 ""It's going to the bazaar or market, like we've been doing for hundreds of years, but bringing it to a mobile app in a super-compelling way.""
-Eric Kim, managing partner, Goodwater Capital
 Playing in such a competitive market tends to be a losing proposition for start-ups, but Tophatter continues to draw investors, in part because of a leadership team with experience in the auction and e-commerce battle zones. Blachman was a Stanford engineer who ran Get Me In, a European online ticket marketplace acquired by Ticketmaster in 2008. Co-founder Ashvin Kumar was an intern at Amazon before helping to launch Blippy, also backed by Charles River Ventures, in 2009. The online service, which allowed selected friends to see and comment on one's credit card purchases, went belly up in 2011, though it was valued at $46 million at one point. ""These guys bring maniacal focus to finding the next great experience for retail online,"" Kim says.
Tophatter's plan is to push its international profile. Blachman says the site is working on adapting languages and currencies and fixing kinks on delivery systems to make sure inventory ships quickly and cheaply to customers around the world — ""a difficult challenge,"" he says.
Tophatter's other goal is to develop and grow the site less as a sales vehicle than as entertainment. ""We're not competing so much with Amazon and eBay as we are with whatever game or social media you play with on your phone,"" Blachman says.
""We want to be the thing you do when you've got two minutes standing in line at the grocery store or 10 minutes waiting for your kids to finish soccer practice. ""The idea is to bring back the concept that it's actually fun to shop.""

Vehicles drive through the parking lot outside a Whole Foods Market Inc. location in Willowbrook, Illinois.
 Here's one unique way to keep an eye on Whole Foods' business since the grocer was scooped up by Amazon: monitor the number of cars in its parking lots.
 Whole Foods' parking lots were fuller in September, JPMorgan reported, based on an analysis of satellite data provided by Orbital Insight. The acquisition of the organic grocery retailer was official starting Aug. 28.
For the month of September, car traffic at Whole Foods stores was up 4.6 percent, the biggest increase since June 2014.
 To be sure, JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman explained in a Wednesday note to clients that car traffic was ""perhaps not as high as some observers may have expected.""
A two-year stacked number has been falling since July. Car traffic on a two-year stacked basis is computed by adding the number of cars from the period referenced, for example, September 2017, to that of the same period one year ago.
In this case, car traffic at Whole Foods in September 2016 was down nearly 10 percent, dragging the latest two-year stacked number down. At the time, Whole Foods was struggling to grow same-store sales as it bounced back from being accused of price gouging.

At Kroger, which has taken a beating by investors in the aftermath of the Amazon-Whole Foods deal, car traffic dropped significantly in September, JPMorgan said. Satellite data showed a 7.3 percent decrease during the month. On a two-year stacked basis, the drop was even more significant, at 9.8 percent.
This suggests Kroger's same-store sales will be down 0.8 percent in the third quarter, much lower than what analysts have been anticipating, Goldman added.
Kroger shares dove last month, after the grocer's second-quarter profit slid nearly 8 percent as it slashed prices amid growing competition in the sector. Kroger has meantime said it expects same-store sales growth, excluding fuel, of 0.5 to 1 percent for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Kroger and Whole Foods declined to comment.
A spike in Whole Foods' car traffic can be attributed much to the fact that Amazon promised price cuts throughout stores, starting as soon as Aug. 28. And Whole Foods has been known for its ""whole paycheck"" image, so the discounts have been a welcome change for many shoppers.
A study by location intelligence company Foursquare found a 25 percent increase in foot traffic at Whole Foods stores over the first two days that the company was owned by Amazon.
Since then, though, traffic has dropped off, Foursquare told CNBC in a follow-up study. In its second week under Amazon's wings, from Sept. 4 to Sept. 10, traffic was only up about 8 percent when compared with an average week in August 2017.

 EU orders Amazon to pay nearly $300 million   
 9:44  AM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  00:59 
 Amazon was ordered to pay 250 million euros ($294 million) to Luxembourg on Wednesday after the European Commission said the online retailer had received illegal tax benefits.
 According to regulators, Amazon received tax advantages between 2006 and 2014 in the country without any ""valid justification.""
""Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon. As a result, almost three quarters of Amazon's profits were not taxed,"" Margrethe Vestager, the EU's commissioner for competition, said in a statement.
 ""In other words, Amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national tax rules. This is illegal under EU state aid rules. Member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to others,"" she added.
From June 2014, Amazon changed the way it operates in Europe and the new structure is outside the EU Commission's authority on state aid.
In the period investigated, Amazon was shifting its profits from a company that was subject to tax in Luxembourg to another one that wasn't subject to tax, known as the ""holding company."" The latter had no employees, no offices and no business activities.
Luxembourg is due to receive the amount created by the aid, though there are no fines under EU law. Luxembourg authorities said they have taken notice of the decision and will ""use appropriate due diligence to analyze the decision.""

EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager addresses a press conference on two state aid cases at the European Commission in Brussels on October 4, 2017.
 ""The decision of the Commission refers to a period going back to 2006. Over time, both the international and the Luxembourg legal frameworks have substantially evolved,"" they said.
Amazon said in response to the commission's decision that it believes it did not receive any special treatment from Luxembourg and that it paid tax in ""full accordance with both Luxembourg and international tax law.""
""We will study the Commission's ruling and consider our legal options, including an appeal. Our 50,000 employees across Europe remain heads-down focused on serving our customers and the hundreds of thousands of small businesses who work with us,"" the online retailing giant said in a statement.
 Tensions between Europe and US
 The European Commission opened its investigation into Amazon and Luxembourg's tax arrangements in October 2014. 
Luxembourg and U.S. technology companies have been at the center of the commission's probes into tax affairs and antitrust. Last year, the EU ordered Ireland to recover 13 billion euros in taxes from Apple. The commission is also looking into the tax deal between McDonald's and Luxembourg. 
The EU has promised to scrutinize tax arrangements between large mulitnationals and the bloc's member states. This case is likely to increase tensions between Europe and the U.S. After the commission's decision on Apple, Chief Executive Tim Cook denounced it as ""total political crap."" The Amazon tax ruling is also set against a push by President Donald Trump to come up with a money repatriation plan for U.S. companies with big cash piles abroad.
At the heart of the EU's investigation into Amazon is its network of subsidiaries in Europe and so-called transfer pricing. That is the price of goods that one subsidiary of a company sells to another subsidiary under the same corporation. This in itself is not illegal. But what is illegal is if this transfer of goods is mispriced, therefore affecting the profits a company makes, and subsequently how much tax it pays.
In 2004, Amazon restructured its operations to create Amazon EU Sarl, which was its European operating headquarters. Amazon EU Sarl pays a royalty to the parent company in Europe for use of intellectual property. But that parent company is a limited liability partnership, which is not subject to corporate tax in Luxembourg.  
 EU chief under pressure
 The Amazon ruling could be embarrassing for Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, who was Luxembourg's prime minister from 1995 to 2013.
At the opening of these investigations, many European policymakers asked for Juncker's resignation. However, he denied any involvement in the tax arrangements, saying that the prime minister doesn't have enough power to restrict the work of tax authorities.
Correction: This story has been revised to correct the amount in U.S. dollars that Amazon has been ordered to pay.

 Amazon is bringing its Echo speaker and Alexa smart personal assistant to India and Japan, the company said on Wednesday, marking its first foray into Asia with those products.
 The U.S. e-commerce giant said that Alexa and Echo are now available by invitation in India, and are coming to Japan later this year. 
Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Plus are voice-controlled speakers that have Amazon's artificial intelligence (AI) personal assistant Alexa built in. They allow users to talk to the speaker to carry out tasks such playing music or setting reminders.
 The devices will start shipping in India later this month, and Alexa and Echo will be available in Japan later this year.
An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that Alexa will understand when a person speaks English with an Indian accent. But the voice assistant can also fully understand context and intent, even if the sentences include Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malyalam, or Punjabi proper nouns, for example, names of places, people, songs, and movie titles.
The spokesperson could not comment on Alexa's ability to understand Japanese, but pointed CNBC to a press release. 
""The customer response to Alexa and Echo has been incredibly positive. We're excited to make them available for our Japanese customers later this year so they can help shape Alexa as she evolves,"" Toni Reid, vice president of Amazon Alexa, said in a statement. 
This could suggest that Amazon is working on Japaneses language support, though the company could not confirm this. 
In India, the Echo will be priced at 9,999 rupees ($153). 
Amazon has been slowly expanding its Echo product range to other countries since it was first launched in the U.S. in 2014. In 2016, it brought the Echo to Germany and the U.K., its first markets in Europe. 
It has subsequently launched different versions of the Echo, such as the Echo Show, which has a touchscreen. All of these are powered by Alexa.
Japan and India mark Amazon's first foray into Asia with the Alexa and Echo products. 
Tom Taylor, senior vice president of Amazon Alexa, said the company is bringing its developer tools to allow people to create apps to India and Japan to create ""localized Alexa experiences."" 
The smart speaker market is getting increasingly crowded and Amazon faces stiff competition from Google Home and Apple Homepod. Alphabet-owned Google is rumored to be developing a new version of its smart speaker product.
India has been a big focus for Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. Last year, the company said it would invest $3 billion in the country. And Amazon's original content team has been focusing on localized TV shows as part of its Prime service in India. 
""We're grateful that customers are responding — Amazon.in is the most visited and the fastest growing marketplace in India,"" Bezos said after the company's first quarter earnings in April.
""It's still day one for e-commerce in India, and I assure you that we'll keep investing in technology and infrastructure while working hard to invent on behalf of our customers and small and medium businesses in India.""

Oracle CEO Mark Hurd at a roundtable during the company's OpenWorld conference in San Francisco on Oct. 3, 2017.
 Oracle has a tiny share of the cloud infrastructure market, which Amazon Web Services dominates. But Mark Hurd, Oracle's CEO, is making bold predictions for the future.
 ""I like our chances against anybody -- anybody,"" Hurd said in an interview with CNBC at the OpenWorld conference on Tuesday. ""I think we're going to win, bar none."" 
The numbers aren't in his favor. According to Synergy Research Group, Oracle isn't among the top four contenders, a group that includes Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Google. The fourth-ranked cloud, Google, has just 5 percent of the market, while AWS controls 34 percent.
 Companies can use public cloud infrastructure to run applications and websites. The market has become so competitive that vendors like Hewlett Packard Enterprise and VMware have ditched their public clouds. That's not in Oracle's plans.
Still, when asked if Oracle would crack the top three, Hurd wouldn't say.
""I'm not as riveted on whether it's six months, a year, 18 months -- because we're in this for the long haul,"" he said. ""It's not as important to me about what the date is that we get to the destination, but what's more important to me is that we make progress every single day, and every single day we're better than we were yesterday.""
Ambitious rhetoric is nothing new for Oracle leadership. Larry Ellison, the company's billionaire founder, has routinely said Oracle is beating rivals Salesforce and Workday in cloud software, despite what the results show.

 6:57  PM ET Thu, 18 May 2017 |  01:16 
 Hurd's latest comments come a few weeks after Oracle tied certain executive compensation to cloud growth goals. One goal is for Oracle to capture more than $10 billion in revenue from cloud platform and infrastructure services in a single fiscal year. 
In the most recent quarter, Oracle's cloud infrastructure and platform services produced $400 million in revenue, up 28 percent year over year. Meanwhile, in the second quarter AWS generated $4.1 billion in revenue, up 42 percentfrom the prior year.
Oracle still has a massive legacy business. Hurd said he tells customers that the company isn't about to kill its software products that run in traditional data centers, so clients are not pressured to rush to the cloud.
""You have to move to the cloud, you have to move by June -- I don't think so,"" Hurd said.
That position, which to some degree mirrors Microsoft's, makes sense for Oracle. But the growth is, generally, in the cloud.
Just look at Oracle's results: The company generated less revenue in fiscal 2017 than it did three years earlier.

 Amazon prudently cherry-picking dense delivery areas: Morningstar's Keith Schoonmaker   
 3:40  PM ET Thu,  5 Oct 2017 |  03:22 
 If Amazon gets into the delivery business, it won't hurt UPS and FedEx as much as expected, analyst Keith Schoonmaker told CNBC on Thursday.
 Shares of UPS and FedEx were initially hit on Thursday after a report about competition from Amazon. FedEx ultimately closed a fraction of a point higher, while UPS recovered to close 0.7 percent down.
Schoonmaker, director of industrial equity research at Morningstar, said Amazon accounts for only a small portion of UPS' and FedEx's revenues.
 ""I think it's important to frame UPS' and FedEx's exposure to Amazon. UPS says that no customer constitutes 10 percent of its revenue, and FedEx says no one constitutes three percent of its revenue. We would gauge earnings exposure more like mid-single digits to UPS and maybe 2 percent for FedEx,"" he said in an interview with ""Closing Bell.""

 Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that Amazon is trying out a new delivery program called ""Seller Flex"" where the company will pick up packages from third parties selling on its platform and deliver the products to consumers. The project would directly take over functions typically handled by UPS and FedEx.
""I lived in downtown Chicago in a dense neighborhood full of high rises, and I've had Amazon deliveries by Amazon independent contractors for probably two years now. So this is nothing new — that Amazon is taking some ownership of their deliveries,"" Schoonmaker said.
He added that Amazon is ""prudently cherry-picking areas with dense delivery"" and will probably still leave rural delivery up to other companies.
Meanwhile, Amazon could also take years to establish its new service, according to John Eade, president of Argus Research.
""The goods need to get there in two days or less, and right now, it's UPS and FedEx that can do that best,"" Eade said in an interview with ""Power Lunch.""

 He also pointed out UPS and FedEx's strong stock growth.
""Second-quarter revenues for UPS were up about 8 percent. FedEx, they had a problem with the cyberattack, but they're growing about the same rate too. Those are great growth numbers,"" he said.
Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" isn't sure those numbers will continue to rise much longer.
Amazon distribution threats can have real power, he said Thursday on ""Squawk on the Street."" He explained that the stock of drugstore chain Walgreens has struggled after news that Amazon could be looking to break into the multibillion-dollar pharmacy market.
When asked whether UPS and FedEx investors should be concerned about Amazon entering the market, Cramer said ""yes.""
""We'll wait for a second day. See if anyone joins or downgrades these, and then you got your shot,"" he said, referring to UPS and FedEx.
So far, Amazon shares are outperforming the delivery companies again this year. The internet e-commerce giant is up 29 percent year to date through Wednesday versus UPS' 4 percent and FedEx's 19 percent returns.

 The hit to delivery service companies' stocks on fears that Amazon will disrupt the industry might have some staying power, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.
 UPS and FedEx shares fell Thursday after a Bloomberg News report said that the online retailer is experimenting with a new delivery program called ""Seller Flex"" and that it plans a broader rollout in 2018.
Bloomberg said with the project Amazon would directly take over functions typically handled by UPS and FedEx.
 Amazon distribution threats can have real power, Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street."" He explained that the stock of drug store retailer Walgreens has struggled after news that Amazon could be looking to break into the multibillion-dollar pharmacy market.

""Let's watch the transports,"" Cramer added. ""Because classic Dow theory says as long as they go up we're fine. Watch JB Hunt, XPO Logistics — not in the transports average but [has] been extraordinary.""

 });Bestselling author Kazuo Ishiguro has been a longtime favorite for millions of readers, including one particular book lover — Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.
 On Thursday, the Japanese-British novelist claimed his place in history as the 2017 winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature. One of the books for which Ishiguro is best known, ""The Remains of the Day,"" is one of Bezos' favorite books.

Kazuo Ishiguro, author of ""Remains of the Day"" and other bestsellers, pictured in 2010.
 The novel, in which a butler reflects on his life, is one of several titles Amazon employees refer to as ""Jeff's Reading List,"" according to the unofficial Bezos biography ""The Everything Store,"" by Brad Stone. 
 In fact, Ishiguro's writing changed the way the Amazon founder viewed his career, according to Stone's book.
In ""The Remains of the Day"" an English butler referred to as Mr. Stevens recalls his time serving in the army during WWI. The book, which was adapted into an Academy Award-nominated film, explores the meaning of duty, the pursuit of greatness and the sacrifices that come with both.

 One of the most powerful themes that emerges from the story is the power of remorse and the difficulties of dealing with it.
 For Bezos, that theme apparently struck a chord, inspiring him to develop what he calls ""the regret-minimization framework,"" or a way of living his life that reduces the number of regrets he has, according to the biography.
Stone writes that Bezos read the book before launching Amazon, but the founder's wife, MacKenzie Bezos, says he read it a year after starting the company.
""Bezos has said he learns more from novels,"" Stone writes, ""than nonfiction.""

Amazon's Alexa voice assistant can be used to unlock some Nissan cars remotely.
 Nissan owners will soon be able to access their car by asking Amazon's voice assistant Alexa to unlock the vehicle for them.
 Certain Nissan models made between 2016 and 2018 will be equipped with the technology that will allow drivers to tell Alexa to carry out tasks such as flashing the lights, unlocking the car remotely and honking the horn.
It works in vehicles that have NissanConnect Services's telematics system, the Japanese manufacturer's in-car software. Users will need a subscription to this.
 Later this month, users can download a new Alexa skill called NissanConnect Services in the Amazon Skills Store. A skill is similar to an app, but is specific to Alexa. Once this is downloaded, Alexa will be able to control some of the car functions.
Amazon has been striking deals with automakers to bring Alexa to cars. Last month, BMW said Alexa capabilities will be in some of its cars from 2018.
While Amazon missed out on the smartphone wave, it is now vying to be a major player in the home through products like the Echo smart speaker, and in the auto industry through Alexa.
But Amazon is up against the likes of Google and Apple, which have their own in-car operating systems.

 UPS, FedEx shares drop on Amazon fears   
 11:55  AM ET Thu,  5 Oct 2017 |  00:49 
 Delivery company shares are dropping as investors worry Amazon is about to disrupt the industry.
 Shares of UPS fell more than 0.7 percent Thursday. FedEx dropped as much as 1.6 percent before closing 0.1 percent higher.
Bloomberg News is reporting Amazon is trying out a new delivery program called ""Seller Flex"" where the company will pick up packages from third-party sellers selling on its platform and deliver the products to consumers.
 Amazon clarified that the offering will continue to use some of its current delivery partners, but didn't comment on whether it will increase its own deliveries directly to customers.
""We are using the same carrier partners to offer this program that we've used for years, including UPS, USPS and FedEx,"" Amazon said in a statement.
One analyst believes a big expansion by Amazon into the delivery business is inevitable. 
""Given the investments that Amazon is making in fulfillment infrastructure and transportation to support its own retail business, we view it simply a matter of time until they offer these services to third parties more broadly,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in an email. ""This is the same strategy that Amazon has successfully utilized in retail (third party marketplace) and technology (AWS) where they offer as a service the same platforms built to run their business.""

 UPS and FedEx shares falter on Amazon delivery service test   
 9:46  AM ET Thu,  5 Oct 2017 |  01:44 
 UPS has downplayed the Amazon disruption threat in the past.
""We don't believe that Amazon's strategy is to do it themselves and the reason we believe that is we have this huge infrastructure, we're investing in technology, we have a great mutual relationship with them,"" UPS CEO David Abney said in an interview with CNBC in December 2016.
But the Amazon disruption threat has been a worry popping up periodically on earnings conference calls with analysts over the last year for both FedEx and UPS.
FedEx on such a call in March of this year was asked about Amazon diving deeper into delivery. CEO Fred Smith signaled to analysts that his company may be less exposed to this risk than rival UPS.
""The vast majority of FedEx's business is business to business. Eighty-five percent-plus of our business has nothing to do with e-commerce,"" he said.
Smith continued:
 ""So Amazon's a wonderful company and they certainly have revolutionized the e-commerce world, and we're not sure what Amazon's going to do one way or another. But the FedEx system that consists of thousands of facilities and the ability to pick up, transport, and deliver in one to two business days between any two addresses in the United States has been decades in the making. And we think that we have not a great risk of being disrupted, to use the term."" 
The theory that FedEx is less exposed to this threat than UPS is apparent looking at the chart of both stocks versus the e-commerce juggernaut over the last five years. FedEx has posted strong returns, but UPS has actually trailed the market.
 Amazon shares are outperforming the delivery companies again this year so far. The internet e-commerce giant is up 29 percent year to date through Wednesday versus UPS' 4 percent and FedEx's 19 percent returns. The S&P 500 is up 13 percent in the same time period.
This isn't the first time Amazon has made moves building out its own delivery offering. The Wall Street Journal reported in September 2016 the company was expanding its last-mile delivery services in major cities.
FedEx's Patrick Fitzgerald sent this statement in response to the report:
 ""We don't comment on speculative news stories but there continues to be reporting related to our networks and the transportation industry that demonstrates a clear misunderstanding of the scale, infrastructure and complexity involved in running a global transportation network. FedEx and other transportation providers are innovating as it relates to new services for e-commerce residential deliveries, but that is only one piece of the capabilities that we provide. Demand for our global portfolio continues to grow."" 
UPS also sent the following statement:
 ""Amazon is a valued UPS customer. We support all our customers with industry-leading ecommerce solutions and expect to expand these relationships further in the future. UPS continues to experience topline growth and margin enhancement driven by business-to-consumer volume growth and strong international expansion.""

An employee stacks items to be shipped at the Amazon fulfillment center in Phoenix.
 Online retail giant Amazon.com is reportedly experimenting with a new delivery service.
 Bloomberg reported, citing two people familiar with the matter, that Amazon's new service would be aimed at making more items available for free two-day shipping. It would also relieve overcrowding in the company's warehouses.
The news sent shares of UPS lower, with the stock dropping 0.7 percent. FedEx's stock dropped before closing 0.1 percent higher.
 Amazon has been testing the new service in India for two years, Bloomberg said, adding it was deployed in West Coast states on a trial basis earlier this year. The report also said Amazon is calling the project ""Seller Flex"" and that it plans a broader rollout in 2018.
With this project, Amazon would directly take over functions typically handled by UPS and FedEx, Bloomberg said.
Shares of Amazon rose 1.6 percent.
UPS told CNBC in a statement:
""Amazon is a valued UPS customer. We support all our customers with industry-leading ecommerce solutions and expect to expand these relationships further in the future.""
Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president of integrated marketing and communications at FedEx, said:

 });When it comes to paid time off for new parents, the  U.S. comes in last place among the 41 countries that comprise the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED). The government does not mandate any paid leave for parents, and as of March 2016, only 13 percent of all private industry workers had access to paid family leave, according to the  Bureau of Labor Statistics.
 In the race for top talent, several U.S. tech companies have led the way on this issue, boosting their parental leave policies in recent years. Twitter, for instance, offers 20 weeks of paid leave to all new parents, and Facebook provides four months to full-time employees.
More than most, Amazon has been on the cutting edge. The retail behemoth not only offers a generous paid parental leave policy for both moms and dads, it also helps parents ramp back up after being out and even pays for its employees' spouses who do not work at the company to take time off.
 The company's latest parental leave policies were launched in 2015 after employees said the previous policy wasn't working for them.
""It wasn't comprehensive enough, didn't give new parents enough time with their children and often the transition back to work was difficult,"" says Steve Winter, Amazon's director of global programs and services, who led the redesign. ""So HR looked into ways to improve it. We wanted to build an egalitarian program that would work for all of our employees.""

 Two years ago, Amazon began offering birth mothers up to 14 weeks of paid maternity leave, plus an additional six weeks to those who've been with the company for a year. Altogether, that's a total of 20 weeks, or about five months, of fully paid leave that moms can potentially take.
""The first few weeks are critical,"" says Liz Swanby, an operations manager at Amazon who welcomed her son almost three years ago. She points to small moments like a child's first bath.
""You don't get that time back,"" she tells CNBC Make It.
 Liz Swanby (on left) with her wife Andrea Swanby and their two children.
 It was important to Amazon to extend the benefits to all employees. Now dads, adoptive parents and non-birth mothers who've been with the company for a year get six weeks of fully paid parental leave.
Employees can also choose to take their parental leave in one continuous six-week period or split into two periods within 12 months of birth or adoption.
Additionally, through its Adoption Assistance benefit, eligible U.S. employees can be reimbursed for qualified adoption expenses, such as adoption fees, attorney fees, court costs and travel costs, up to $5,000 for a single child adoption or up to $10,000 combined maximum for a sibling adoption.
One of the most unique aspects of Amazon's parental leave policy is its Leave Share program, which allows employees to share their parental leave with a partner who doesn't work at Amazon and whose employer does not provide paid parental leave.
For example, Jason, an Amazon employee, is entitled to six weeks of paternal leave. His wife Emily doesn't work at Amazon and her employer does not provide paid leave. Jason can give three of his six weeks to his wife and keep the other three weeks for himself.
During his three weeks of leave, Jason is paid his full salary, and Amazon also pays Emily her husband's base salary for three weeks so that she, too, can take time off.
""Leave Share came out of employee focus groups, where we received feedback about the struggle that comes with a partner who doesn't get paid leave,"" Winter tells CNBC Make It. ""It was actually [Amazon CEO] Jeff Bezos who really embraced this concern and challenged us to think big about how to create an experience for employees that could completely change not just their experience with a newborn, but their partners as well.""
The second initiative that makes the company's policy stand out is its Ramp Back program, which allows new parents to ease back to work with an eight-week flexible schedule and reduced work hours.
For example, after a new parent returns to Amazon from her parental leave, she can choose between a variety of schedules for eight weeks. She can return to work for eight weeks at 50 percent capacity, eight weeks at 75 percent or four weeks at 50 percent followed by four weeks at 75 percent.

 Amazon recruiter reveals: Here's how young people can score a job there   
 5:30  PM ET Mon, 11 Sept 2017 |  00:55 
 From 2015 to 2017, the company looked at extensive data and feedback from employees, and the results were telling: Amazon employees who had used the new benefits said they provided both financial and emotional relief and allowed them to come back to work better prepared to take on their day-to-day tasks.
Since launch, more than 11,000 U.S. employees have taken parental leave at Amazon, which covers everyone from warehouse workers to senior corporate executives. In the U.S. alone, that's over 200,000 employees.
Nearly three-quarters of employees who have used the paid leave benefit are hourly employees, and more than 60 percent of employees who have used parental leave are fathers.
Amazon's policy is an anomaly among U.S. companies as a whole. In fact, although most Americans support paid family and medical leave and believe that employers should cover the costs, according to a 2016  Pew Research Center study, few employers offer this benefit.
While most employers do offer unpaid parental leave — thanks in part to the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which guarantees eligible workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year — the cost of not earning income for an extended period can hit families hard.
Swanby and her wife, Andrea, say that Amazon's parental leave policy was vital after the birth of their son Max, who was born with a form of dwarfism and is considered special needs.
""We had so many health-care situations and hospital trips for our son,"" says Andrea, who is a stay-at-home mother. ""It was a really difficult time.""
However, they were able to maximize the leave policy, with Swanby taking off six weeks.
Andrea explains that it cannot just be one parent solely responsible for all the ""chaos"" that comes with having a new child. ""Companies should be more sensitive to that, especially to more atypical situations like ours,"" she says.
Swanby adds that parental leave is not just beneficial for parents but also for companies. Since she was able to ""ease back into work"" for the first few weeks, she didn't come back feeling overwhelmed and was able to focus on her job knowing that things were running smoothly at home.
Paid time off for new parents ""is a win-win for employees and employers,"" she says.
""When things are going well at home, I do better at work. The two co-exist.""

 Amazon Bar, according to the company's website, will be located in Tokyo's upscale Ginza area and serve a variety of drinks, including beer, wine, and whiskey.
But it comes with one caveat: there's no menu.
 The bar will instead deploy a recommendation system with Amazon sommeliers offering suggestions for different types of drinks. It will also serve special drinks that are only available at Amazon Bar, the website says.
The bar will launch on Oct. 20, and will be open to the public.
Amazon didn't say why it's opening the bar and for such a short period. The company has been introducing physical book stores and pop-up stores of late, while also expanding into the grocery space with the Whole Foods acquisition.
At the same time, Amazon has been moving into the alcohol business. In August, the company quietly expanded its one-hour wine delivery service in select U.S. cities. Last year, Amazon Japan launched a wine recommendation service by phone that featured its own in-house sommeliers.
An Amazon representative wasn't immediately available for comment.

""We have a huge challenge with the question of the GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon),"" Le Maire told CNBC at the Women's Forum in Paris. ""You'll think that I am obsessed by the United States — that's not the case. We just want to have fair trade in the world,"" he said.
 One of the biggest proposals is to tax companies on their revenues rather than on their profits. Taxing the latter would usually culminate in a smaller number. The idea with an ""equalization"" tax is to avoid firms taking advantage of different tax codes across the 28 European member countries, which has allowed many of them to pay little tax in some countries.

 2:50  AM ET Fri,  6 Oct 2017 |  01:11 
 Le Maire said that it was hard to explain to smaller firms why they were paying much more tax in France, on a relative basis, compared to larger firms.
""We are of the view that we can't explain to small companies in France … That they are obliged to pay the taxes in France and of course huge taxes because we are still in France and other great companies, huge companies, huge internet companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, can be in France, have their profits, make some benefits in France and high benefits in France without paying any taxes to the French Treasury,"" Le Maire said.
Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. Many large U.S. tech firms base their European headquarters in EU nations with favorable tax regimes, that often means they book the majority of their European profits in those countries.

 The European Commission ruled Wednesday that the online retailer Amazon benefited from illegal tax benefits in Luxembourg and has to pay back nearly $300 million in unpaid taxes. Last year, the EU also ordered Ireland to recoup 13 billion euros ($15.2 billion) in back taxes from Apple. The Commission has often been accused of trying to hurt U.S. firms.
Paul Gambles, managing partner at MBMG Group, told CNBC that it seems that the European Union is backing rising protectionism and thus helping its own companies against competition from U.S. firms.
Le Maire rejected the idea that asking U.S. firms to pay the right amount of taxes is financial protectionism. It's a question of fairness, he said.

 Amazon is on the brink of deciding if it will make a big move into selling drugs online   
 3:11  PM ET Fri,  6 Oct 2017 |  03:32 
 Amazon is in the final stages of figuring out its strategy to get into the multibillion-dollar prescription drug market. 
 The company will decide before Thanksgiving whether to move into selling prescription drugs online, according to an email from Amazon viewed by CNBC and a source familiar with the situation. If it decides to make that move, it will start expanding its senior team with drug supply chain experts. 
Amazon typically spends years researching opportunities before it telegraphs its intentions. The opportunity to sell drugs online is alluring given its market size -- analysts have estimated the U.S. prescription drug market at $560 billion per year. Amazon is well aware of the complexities, say sources familiar with the company's thinking. 
 Amazon declined to comment.
In the past year, Amazon has ramped up its hiring and consulted with dozens of people about a potential move into the pharmacy market. The consumables team, which includes groceries, kicked off the research, with the division's vice president, Eric French, taking the lead. 
It brought on Mark Lyons from Premera Blue Cross to build an internal pharmacy benefits manager for its own employees, say multiple people familiar. According to one of the people, it's possible that the push into the broader drug supply chain hinges on its success with this effort.
In May, the company kicked off its search for a general manager to lead its pharmacy push, externally dubbed ""healthcare.""
Analyst firm Leerink has separately reported that Amazon will get into the pharmacy management space and expects an announcement within the next year or two.
Goldman Sachs published a report on the topic in August of this year, speculating that Amazon will ultimately look to improve price transparency for consumers and reduce out-of-pocket costs.
Amazon already has a business selling medical supplies online, such as gauze and thermometers. It also has a health team called 1492, which is focused on both hardware and software projects, like developing health applications for the Echo and Dash Wand. Its cloud service, Amazon Web Services, continues to dominate the health and life sciences market.

 Fewer than 1 million people view Amazon's critically acclaimed show ""Transparent,"" according to The Wall Street Journal.
Amid a disappointing showing at this year's Emmy Awards, an Amazon Studios executive said ""we're getting chewed up,"" according to a Journal report published on Friday. 
 The creators of hits such as ""The Shield"" and ""Ally McBeal"" — both of whom did not have success with their Amazon projects — told the Journal that Amazon is in ""chaos"" and ""in way over their heads.""  (Some other producers quoted in the story had positive experiences, one calling Amazon Studios ""liberating"").
Amazon Studios' Original Movies won three Academy Awards this year, two for the hit ""Manchester by the Sea."" Amazon has also had success with deals such as Thursday Night Football, which drew 1.6 million viewers to the recent Chicago-Green Bay game. And the company has said for several years that it will be flexible in balancing artists' creativity and the use of data-driven programming.
Nonetheless, the Journal reports that Amazon has interviewed at least two new candidates to take over the film unit. The company also plans to pare back children's programming and shift away from so-called hipster shows, in favor of content with wider appeal, like sci-fi and spy fiction, the report said.
Amazon was not immediately available to comment on the report and did not provide a statement to the Journal.

 Cramer: Here's why Costco is going be a major focus today   
 9:59  AM ET Fri,  6 Oct 2017 |  02:54 
 Costco Wholesale's latest quarterly earnings conference call was ""very disturbing,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday.
 During the call, Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti addressed concerns about Amazon Prime impacting Costco's membership offering. Costco's membership renewal rates declined as its gross margins narrowed during the fourth quarter.
""As it relates to the publicity and the news and the noise around Amazon and Whole Foods, all we can do is perform,"" Galanti told analysts and investors.
 The CFO then explained that slowing membership sign-ups at Costco were partially a result of decisions the retailer had made in past months, like opting to no longer accept American Express. Costco also raised fees on its 90 million members earlier this year.
""It was very disturbing,"" according to Cramer, ""because it basically just says, 'Amazon is coming for [Costco], and [Costco doesn't] even care what [it] say[s].'""
Shares of Costco were falling more than 6 percent Friday, one day after the retailer reported a drop in quarterly margins, which raised concerns of an intensifying grocer price war. Shoppers were seen buying more fuel, which is less profitable, at Costco during the latest period.
With membership renewal rates on the decline, and management expecting this to continue for another six months, ""this remains a top focus for investors given concerns about the competitive environment and migration to online shopping,"" Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder wrote in a note to clients.
""This could create some volatility in the shares, but strong traffic and comps should provide downside protection,"" Binder added.
Investors have been wary that Costco's business model, which mainly generates revenue through a niche membership club, faces increased competition from Amazon. The e-commerce giant is shaking up the grocery industry in acquiring Whole Foods.
Meantime, Costco shares have fallen more than 7 percent since the Amazon-Whole Foods deal was announced in June. The retailer's stock is down about 2 percent in 2017.
Investors do not want to pay ""25 times earnings for a company that is up against Amazon,"" Cramer said Friday on ""Squawk on the Street.""
The host of CNBC's ""Mad Money"" added that Costco's stock has had a great run, and its stores have ""put up some unbelievable numbers in every single aisle"" — but ""no one is listening.""
""They're not signing up like they used to be. ... Do millennials still go there?"" Cramer asked. ""Every question of the undercurrent is Amazon.""
""It's not a comedy, it's a tragedy,"" he said.
After the bell on Thursday, Costco reported that its fourth-quarter net income rose to $919 million, or $2.08 per share, from $779 million, or $1.77 per share, a year ago.
Total revenue rose 15.7 percent, to $42.30 billion.
For Costco, ""Renewal rates will remain the focus for investors over the next year, given concerns about AMZN, grocery delivery and a recent fee hike,"" Jefferies' Binder reiterated.

 Competing with Amazon on distribution   
 8:38  PM ET Fri,  6 Oct 2017 |  01:30 
 Silicon Valley start-up and logistics darling Flexport is closing a $110 million funding round, valuing it at $910 million.
 Backers in this round include Yuri Milner's DST, Peter Thiel's Founder's Fund and Wells Fargo. It also counts Google Ventures — now GV — among its earliest investors.
Flexport sits right within the delivery space that rival Amazon is investing heavily in. In a blog post, Flexport says they raised this round because they're ""doubling down.""
 When companies do not want to rely on Amazon's logistics pipeline for international freight forwarding, they turn to Flexport, which takes care of the process and handles sensitive customs information — even if that means getting products to an FBA, or ""fulfilled by Amazon,"" hub.
Its 1,800 customers include some of the buzziest new names in e-commerce, including Warby Parker, Casper, Allbirds and the Honest Company.
""I think there's a lot of hesitancy to turn over sensitive data,"" says Ryan Petersen, founder and CEO of Flexport. ""Although Amazon may not make glasses today, who knows tomorrow? And if you're Warby Parker, do you want to trust them with the names of all your factories and what you're paying for everything? I'd be hesitant.""
Over the last year alone, Amazon has pushed further into its own private label clothing, groceries, advertising and devices, among other businesses. And there are reports that the e-commerce giant is eyeing the furniture, home appliance and pharmaceuticals markets. The list can seem endless — and daunting for up-and-coming brands thinking about handing over sensitive data to Amazon in the international shipping process.
That's where Flexport comes in, and it's a big part of the reason it's had success raising money to play in a market where Amazon is just getting started.
""The largest freight forwarder in the world has a 2 percent market share in a trillion-dollar market,"" Petersen adds. ""And global trade grows by 3 percent a year. So even if Amazon becomes the biggest freight forwarder in the world, I think there will be room for others.""
As for his own IPO plans — Petersen says he wouldn't shy away from going public, even as other private companies stay private for longer.
""Long term, being public gives you a currency to go to M&A, and hire people. You can't have people forever wanting to get paid in the future — investors or employees,"" he said.
""It also sends a signal to the world that we're here to stay,"" he said.
Correction: This article has been updated to correct the spelling of Ryan Petersen's name and the amount of the company's valuation.

Amazon is considering a more serious bid against YouTube, ad industry sources say  Wal-Mart promises 30-second returns in stores, as Amazon tries to catch up  Executive Edge: Amazon considers selling prescription drugs online  Sources: Amazon to compete with YouTube ad opportunities  ","Scott Mlyn | CNBC 
 Carl's Jr., the fast food chain that once used sexy ads to sell burgers, says it's now trying to seduce Amazon one tweet at a time.
Starting at 3 a.m. ET Monday, the Franklin, Tenn.-based sandwich brand will tweet a ""billion dollar'' idea once an hour for 24 hours to try and grab the e-commerce titan's attention.
""This is about generating a conversation around a partnership,'' Jeff Jenkins, Chief Marketing Officer, Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, said in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY. ""The tweets are obviously a start to try and see where the dialogue goes …have a lot of fun with it, and see if they find the spirit of it as fun as we do.''
 The pitches will include the ""Eater Reader,'' a food tray that can also cradle Amazon's Kindle tablet allowing the diner to read and eat the same time, and ""Prime Thru,"" an express drive through lane just for Amazon's fee-paying Prime members.
The fast food chain, which debuted $5 ""All Star Meals"" in a box last month, says it also sees symmetry with Amazon's ubiquitous brown packages left at customers' front doors.
""You have boxes, we have boxes,'' Jenkins says of the message. ""We think there's magic here.''

Amazon is being courted by many suitors. Cities are competing to become home to the online retailer's second headquarters, HQ2, which will bring as many as 50,000 new jobs, and inject billions of dollars into the local economy.
The Carl's Jr. tweet storm is keeping in line with the unconventional marketing that was the sandwich chain's signature for years as it ran ads featuring scantily clad women suggestively eating juicy burgers.
The company dropped that marketing strategy in the spring to shift the spotlight to the quality of its charbroiled burgers and other menu items. The sandwich brand has been facing increasing competition from such rivals as Five Guys and Panera Bread, which emphasize their healthier ingredients.
Carl's Jr. even launched a TV ad campaign that made fun of its suggestive marketing. But Jenkins says the company still believes it has to be creative to generate buzz.
""We've got to be impossible to ignore,'' he says. ""Both Carls Jr. and (sister brand) Hardee's have a history of provocative advertising ... The question is how do you modernize that.''
Beyond the initial 24 hours, Carl's Jr. will continue aiming mock presentations and proposals at Amazon via twitter all week.
Whether the tweeted pitches - like the ""Tender Button'' to get a chicken tender delivered to your door - ever see the light of day remains to be seen.
""Some of the ideas are closer to home (to what) we could execute, but some are obviously pushing the envelope,'' Jenkins says. Still ""people always overestimate what could happen in two years, and underestimate what will happen in ten.''

 Sources: Amazon to compete with YouTube ad opportunities   
 4:37  PM ET Mon,  9 Oct 2017 |  01:00 
 Amazon is taking meetings about launching programs to bring more advertisers to its video platforms and make it a stronger competitor against YouTube.
 The company has had multiple meetings where it suggested it would be launching more advertiser-friendly initiatives. Several people said Amazon suggested it would be more open to giving advertisers more data on what viewers were watching and what they were doing online. Another potential program would pair companies with vetted video producers to create sponsored content, one buyer said. Since the production is technically an advertisement, Amazon would get some of the deal money.
Amazon has also met with several technology companies regarding how to prevent inappropriate content from appearing next to ads, an issue called content adjacency, several people with knowledge of the meetings told CNBC. The industrywide issue was put in the spotlight when several ads on YouTube and on other Google-owned platforms were seen running next to neo-Nazi and jihadist content in March.
 CNBC spoke to five sources with knowledge of the talks, including people from major advertising companies and media companies. These sources requested anonymity because these were private meetings with Amazon about potential projects, and they were not authorized to discuss them publicly.
Digital video advertising is booming, with U.S. video ad spending reaching $13.23 billion this year according to eMarketer. One of the largest recipients of revenue is YouTube, which will garner 21.7 percent of U.S. video ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer's estimates. However advertisers have been hungry for more places to put video in order to increase competition, especially with a company that could have the scale and reach of YouTube. 
Amazon had 310 million monthly active customers when it last reported numbers during Q1 of 2016. Though it pales in comparison to YouTube's 1.5 billion monthly active users, if Amazon could tell advertisers what its customers like to watch online and pair that with their shopping habits, one source noted this could be a ""game changer; the big thing to watch for disrupting the overall ecosystem."" 
Currently Amazon allows anyone to upload videos through a program called Amazon Video Direct (AVD), The videos are then available to buy or rent, stream through Amazon Prime or to watch for free with ads. It also owns Twitch, a video platform where users can livestream content and save previous sessions to be watched on-demand. 
Although AVD's current ad-supported program is comparable to YouTube's offering, advertisers aren't bullish on it yet. Media buyers said it doesn't give out as much information about ad performance (including return on investment) compared to YouTube and doesn't allow third parties to audit how well the ads are doing, with one media buyer calling it a ""black box."" It's also pricier than YouTube. For these reasons, many companies still think of YouTube as the de facto video platform to advertise on. But if Amazon could give advertisers more data about consumers and allow its information to paired with analytics from outside sources, it could make it a gigantic force. 
Amazon declined comment.

 Wal-Mart promises 30-second returns in stores   
 11:05  AM ET Mon,  9 Oct 2017 |  00:49 
 Making a return at Wal-Mart used to take roughly five minutes. But the discount retailer is on a mission to slash that to 30 seconds, said Daniel Eckert, senior vice president of Wal-Mart Services and Digital Acceleration.
 The company will take its first step in early November – when it rolls out Wal-Mart's Mobile Express Returns, for items sold and shipped by Walmart.com. Store purchases should be integrated into the system by early 2018.
""We know that returning an item and waiting for a refund, especially for a product purchased online, isn't always seamless, so we've completely transformed the process for our customers – whether they are shopping in stores or at Walmart.com,"" Eckert said in prepared remarks.
 Shoppers often consider returning unwanted or defective purchases to stores to be a hassle. And unfortunately, it's often unavoidable. At least 30 percent of all products ordered online are returned, compared to an average of 9 percent of in-store purchases, according to online retail consultant Invesp.
For Wal-Mart's online shoppers, making a return will soon require just two steps. Customers will start the returns process on their phones, using Wal-Mart's app before heading to the store. Then, using a Mobile Express Lane at a Wal-Mart store, they will scan a QR code, which will prompt a refund to be credited to a shopper's payment account.
 Source: Walmart
Walmart Mobile Express returns.
 Earlier this year, Wal-Mart announced it would be rolling out the so-called Express Lanes at most of its stores, and by late August that undertaking was complete.
The lanes were created specifically for Wal-Mart's Pharmacy and Money Service customers — those that fill their prescriptions at Wal-Mart, and those that transfer money at the retailer's stores.
Now, the lanes will also be used to handle returns.
Starting in December, shoppers will also have a unique option for certain items, like shampoo, household cleaning supplies and cosmetics. Through the Wal-Mart app, a shopper may receive an instant refund on some purchases without having to return anything to the store. Other items — those that stores can't reuse once they've been opened or damaged — are planned to be added to this particular offering over time.
When asked how Wal-Mart will prevent customers abusing the new ""keep it"" option, Eckert said on a call with the media that the company has invested in technology to make sure the service isn't taken advantage of.
To be sure, none of Wal-Mart's retail peers have made a similar promise — receive a refund without bringing an item back — of such a large scale.
""We recognize time has become the new currency in retail, as much as saving money,"" Eckert said on the call. ""We felt [Mobile Express Returns] was a growing expectation we needed to address, and do it well.""
""By leveraging our physical stores and the Walmart app, we're changing the returns game in ways that only Walmart can do,"" Eckert added in prepared remarks.
It's true, e-commerce players like Amazon don't have as vast a physical footprint as retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and Costco today.
Nonetheless, Amazon is making strides to grow its brick-and-mortar presence so that customers have more places readily available to them to make returns. Kohl's, for example, has agreed to open its doors to Amazon, promising to fulfill the internet giant's returns at more than 80 of Kohl's department stores.
Amazon has also started processing returns at Whole Foods stores across the U.S., after it acquired the grocery chain in August.

 3:15  PM ET Tue, 10 Oct 2017 |  00:45 
 Amazon has almost perfected speedy delivery to your home. Now the company is working to make sure your packages get inside the front door, or even into your car.
 The company is in advanced talks to forge a partnership with Phrame, a maker of smart license plates that allow items to be delivered to a car's trunk, according to a person with knowledge of the potential deal. Phrame's product fits around a license plate and contains a secure box that holds the keys to the car. Users unlock the box with their smartphone, and can grant access to others — such as delivery drivers — remotely.
At the same time, Amazon is developing a smart doorbell device that would give delivery drivers one-time access to a person's home to drop off items, said two people familiar with the matter. The sources asked not to be named because the discussions are confidential. 
 The new initiatives are part of Amazon's effort to go beyond convenience and fix problems associated with unattended delivery. As more consumers shop online and have their packages shipped to their homes, valuable items are often left unattended for hours. Web retailers are dealing with products getting damaged by bad weather as well as the rise of so-called porch pirates, who steal items from doorsteps. Amazon also has an incentive to reduce the number of lost packages, as they can be costly.
""Unattended delivery is the least desirable of last-mile fulfillment options as it leaves the package exposed to all kinds of risk,"" said Natalie Berg, an analyst at Planet Retail RNG. ""It's not just the financial cost but also the impact that a failed delivery can have on brand reputation and customer loyalty. Nothing makes shoppers more irate than missing a delivery.""
Amazon, UPS and other delivery companies don't disclose data on lost packages. But according to the smart doorbell maker August, 11 million U.S. homeowners had a package stolen in 2016, and a survey by Shorr Packaging showed 31 percent of U.S. shoppers have experienced package theft.

 Videos of package theft are all over the internet. In one instance, a UPS delivery person was caught on camera stealing a FedEx package sitting in front of a house. In August, the U.S. Postal Service suspended deliveries on the south side of Milwaukee after a series of package thefts in the area.
While we didn't get specific details of the potential Phrame partnership or the smart doorbell, both would likely offer a way for delivery people to drop off items using a temporary code. Phrame products could possibly be offered to Prime members for free, making in-trunk delivery available to Amazon's most frequent shoppers, a source said. Another source said the doorbell could be used for grocery delivery. The Financial Times previously reported on a similar product.
Phrame declined to comment for this story. Amazon also declined to comment.
Amazon has sought a number of different options to reduce unattended delivery. Amazon Lockers have opened in more than 2,000 locations to give customers a safe pick-up spot for packages. The company also has a locker service called The Hub for residential apartment buildings. 
Most recently, Amazon rolled out ""Photo on Delivery,"" a service that sends a photo of your delivered package to your phone. 
 Growing problem
 Amazon has also previously experimented with in-trunk delivery. In 2015, it ran a pilot program for Audi owners in Germany, and the following year tested a service with DHL and Daimler in the same region.
Unattended deliveries have become such a headache in recent years that a new industry has emerged around package protection. Smart doorbell maker Ring lets homeowners monitor their front porch, and Mail Haven makes smart mail boxes to protect packages. Last month, Wal-Mart announced an in-home delivery service in partnership with smart doorbell maker August.
Michael Grabham is the founder of Package Guard, an alarm device that alerts consumers and their neighbors to package theft. He said that package theft is likely to get worse because it's a quick and easy crime to commit.
""There will be more technology solutions that emerge to solve this problem as the problem grows,"" he said.

 });Luxembourg is assessing whether to appeal against the European Union's order to reclaim nearly $300 million in unpaid taxes from Amazon, the country's finance minister has told CNBC.
 ""We do not seem to agree, we considered that there was no state aid on our side, there was no selective advantage that was given to the company we are talking about,"" Pierre Gramegna said Monday at the sidelines of a European meeting.
""We are going to review all our possibilities and eventually appeal. The decision has not been taken,"" he said.
 Brussels announced last week that Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon between 2006 and 2014 without any ""valid justification."" As a result, the country has to recover the unpaid taxes.

A picture taken on June 9, 2016 shows Amazon warehouse in Paris, part of the new service 'Prime Now'.
 Following the European Union's decision, Luxembourg said it ""refers to a period going back to 2006. Over time, both the international and the Luxembourg legal frameworks have substantially evolved.""
Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Gramegna said that ""we shouldn't look at a situation that happened 10 or 15 years ago with the eyes of today.""
Tax issues are a long-standing problem for the EU. Back in December, Ireland also appealed against a Commission ruling to collect $15.2 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple.
More than a year after its initial order, Brussels decided to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice last week for failing to recover the unpaid taxes from Apple.
""It is extremely regrettable that the Commission has taken this action, especially in relation to a case with such a large scale recovery amount,"" the Irish authorities said in a statement.

A customer uses the Yandex.Taxi online app on a smartphone to scan for available taxi cabs in Moscow, Russia
 The Russian technology company Yandex has launched an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant called ""Alice"".
 Yandex, Russia's largest search engine, said in a press release Tuesday that Alice is the first conversational online assistant, possessing ""near-human levels of speech.""
""We wanted Alice to interact with users more like a human, so that users don't need to adapt their requests,"" said Denis Filippov, head of speech technologies at Yandex.
 ""In developing Alice, we leveraged our speech technologies, which currently provide the world's most accurate Russian language recognition. Based on word error rate (WER) measurements, Alice demonstrates near-human levels of speech recognition accuracy,"" Filippov added.
Yandex claimed in a  blog post Tuesday that the digital assistant's advanced level of context allows users to carry out a more relaxed style of conversation.
""For instance, when a user asks Alice, 'What's the weather in Moscow?' and then follows with a question in slang asking, 'And what about Peter?', Alice understands the intent and provides the weather forecast for St. Petersburg,"" the post read.
Alice's voice recognition and synthesis rely on SpeechKit, Yandex's proprietary speech recognition software.
Alice will lift its information from Yandex's suite of services that includes taxis, shopping, payments, music, news, weather, maps and education.

The firm focuses heavily on the Russian market and has signed recent deals with taxi-hailing app Uber and Sberbank, Russia's largest bank.
President Putin has criticized Yandex in the past but reportedly paid a visit in September to help mark the firm's 20th anniversary.

 The most important strategic move for Amazon after its Whole Foods acquisition is not just cutting grocery prices, according to one top Wall Street firm.
 Credit Suisse reaffirmed its outperform rating and raised its price target for the e-commerce giant to the second highest on Wall Street citing Amazon's ability to leverage its Whole Foods purchase to offer faster same-day delivery service in more areas.
""The product development perspective is that while most of the headlines around the Whole Foods acquisition have been about price cuts, we believe the real path for Amazon to create lasting shareholder value is through fulfillment and delivery via Prime Now,"" analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.
 ""Hence, while price cuts capture the headlines, we submit that Amazon will wage war with its competitors with service instead.""
Amazon closed its acquisition of Whole Foods Market in August. Prime Now is the company's free 2-hour delivery service for its Amazon Prime subscribers.
Ju raised his price target for Amazon shares to $1350 from $1,100, representing 37 percent upside from Tuesday's close. He now has the second highest price target on the stock out of 42 analysts, according to FactSet. Wells Fargo has the most bullish target with a $1400 forecast. 
The analyst cited how Amazon's Prime Now delivery service is now only available in the zip codes of 198 Whole Foods stores out of 393 total stores, offering a big potential opportunity to build out the service to new areas.
""And as the consumer value proposition for Amazon has always been the combination of price, selection, and delivery we believe the current headlines about price reductions at Whole Foods will be accompanied by expansion of Prime Now delivery-enabled zip codes,"" he wrote.
Amazon shares have rallied 32 percent this year through Tuesday, compared with the market's 14 percent gain.
Its shares are roughly flat in the Wednesday premarket session after the report.

 Amazon is making it easier for the family's youngest shoppers to click through to Checkout with new parental control settings announced Wednesday. 
 Teens between the ages of 13 and 17 can now create unique logins, linked to a household account, and place orders through the Amazon App to be approved by mom or dad. Parents will receive a text or email with information about the order and the option to approve. 
If the approval process gets tedious, parents can also set pre-approved spending limits. Teens get greater freedom, and parents still get itemized notifications of orders. 
 ""As a parent of a teen, I know how they crave independence, but at the same time that has to be balanced with the convenience and trust that parents need. We've listened to families and have built a great experience for both teens and parents,"" Michael Carr, vice president of Amazon Households, said in a statement. 
Teens will also be able to access Prime-specific features like Prime Video and Twitch if their parents are members.
Parents and teens can sign up at amazon.com/forteens.

 Amazon offers new way for students to get Prime   
 4:15  PM ET Wed, 11 Oct 2017 |  00:45 
 Going to college may not be cheap, but now students don't have to commit to a full year for the Amazon Prime Student plan.
 The company on Wednesday announced a $5.49 monthly payment option for Amazon Prime Student.
A full year retains its $49 price tag, which is still about half the price of a standard Prime account. The new monthly program totals about $65 a year, but Amazon doesn't require a yearlong commitment.
 Current college attendees with an "".edu"" email address can sign up to Prime Student for a maximum of four years. They can also take advantage of a six-month free trial before the monthly payments kick in.
On top of the usual perks of a Prime membership — including free two-day shipping and access to Prime Video's streamable movies and TV shows — the company said Prime Students will get access to special deals, or ""coupons,"" through their subscription.
The coupons can be used for ""college essentials,"" most of which are personal hygiene products such as air fresheners and toiletries. 
The company also announced two new pickup locations in Chicago, bringing its nationwide total to 29.

 Morgan Stanley has a new report out for investors that outlines how Amazon's potential push into pharmacy would benefit consumers. 
 In the first phase, the authors speculate that Amazon could open ""virtual retail pharmacies,"" leveraging its Prime Now network for millions of U.S. consumers to buy drugs online.
""Amazon could use a lighter brick and mortar footprint to drive pricing down,"" the report reads. 
 It would not be a huge challenge for Amazon to become a pharmacy and get added to existing pharmacy benefits managers' networks, the authors suggest. The reason for that is that ""employers are already inquiring about Amazon's potential role,"" which means that pharmacy benefits managers would be unlikely to lock Amazon out. 
Secondly, the company could establish relationships with manufacturers of inexpensive generic drugs.
And finally, and most critically, Amazon would build partnerships with makers of branded drugs.
If the company is successful, Morgan Stanley expects that the rebates and other discounts that are currently retained by companies including the pharmacy benefits managers could ""pass back to consumers.""
All of this could take a ""long time,"" according to the researchers, but it's doable for a company with Amazon's resources and scale. 
Late last week, CNBC reported that Amazon will make a final decision in the next four to six weeks about whether it will move into the drug supply chain. It's still an open question for the company, as pharmacy is a huge market but is highly complex. 
Pharmacy stocks plummeted in the wake of the news report.
While CVS Health, Rite Aid and Walgreens are considered to be most at risk, Morgan Stanley suggests that some companies in the drug supply chain are more insulated. These include Diplomat, as Amazon might not touch the specialty drug market, and UnitedHealth's Optum, which may be a potential partner rather than a competitor.

 Why Wal-Mart isn't done going higher   
 7:07  PM ET Wed, 11 Oct 2017 |  01:03 
 When Wal-Mart announced a $20 billion share buyback and reiterated its bullish forecast for the fiscal year, you bet CNBC's Jim Cramer noticed.
 ""Wal-Mart's being re-rated. This is an important term and I want everyone to understand it,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""This company is actually doing something that's supposed to be theoretically impossible: it's upping its spending on e-commerce; developing systems that will make Jet.com, one of its subsidiaries, a formidable competitor; it's increasing its buyback by $20 billion; it's paying people more while improving the store experience and it's increasing earnings, plus possibly even beating Amazon.""
Even better, Wal-Mart shares are trading at only 19 times earnings, Cramer said, adding that his only regret is not pounding the table more on the big-box retailer's story.
 Cramer was mainly stunned by Wal-Mart's demonstrated ability to take on Amazon. Scores of companies like Nordstrom have spent billions to compete with the e-commerce giant to no avail, yet Wal-Mart has the cash to buy back $20 billion worth of stock.
Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon's decision to pay his employees more has also been bearing fruit, the ""Mad Money"" host said. 
Cramer said one of his recent trips to Wal-Mart proved much better than usual: the workers were friendlier and more helpful, the store was clean and organized and the products were bountiful and sold at a bargain.
""This is not the Wal-Mart we're used to,"" he said.
Moreover, the company has scale. Amazon may have its lucrative cloud business, but Wal-Mart's 5,000 U.S. locations far outnumber Amazon's 400 Whole Foods stores, particularly when it comes to shoppers who prefer pick-up to delivery.
""I don't think anyone can really put a dent in Amazon Web Services ... but I will say this: by virtue of its huge network of stores, Wal-Mart can do plenty of damage to Amazon's retail business,"" Cramer said.
And now that Wal-Mart's management is beginning to flex its muscle, cutting millions of dollars in costs and touting 30-second returns in stores, Cramer said few brick-and-mortar retailers will be able to compete if they don't have a niche like high-end jewelry or specialty clothing.
""It's a two-man race now, but one stock sells for 234 times earnings [and] the other sells for 19 times earnings,"" Cramer said. ""Granted, no major money manager is going to sell Amazon; it's too hot, it's too good. But there's a world of portfolio managers looking for another potentially dominant retailer with a cheap stock and a great balance sheet. Which is why I think the stock of Wal-Mart, even after this miraculous run, is not finished going higher.""

 Amazon has quietly been growing a mysterious office in a small surf town near San Francisco   
 8:35  AM ET Thu, 12 Oct 2017 |  00:40 
 Santa Cruz, located 75 miles south of San Francisco, is a popular surf town best known for its nice weather and beachfront amusement park.
 But soon we may start associating the city more closely with one of the largest tech companies in the world: Amazon.
According to the Silicon Valley Business Journal, Amazon has been quietly growing its presence in Santa Cruz over the past two years, now employing over 100 people in a 40,000 square feet office space.
 It's unclear what exactly the team there is working on or why Amazon has picked Santa Cruz as an office location. But the report says the office has a group of engineers working on the Alexa voice technology and could possibly expand up to 200 people. 
It's also interesting that Amazon didn't take any tax breaks or economic benefits from the city of Santa Cruz for opening an office there. According to another report by the Silicon Valley Business Journal, Amazon has received more than $1.2 billion in state subsidies for the 250 facilities it's built across the country.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Riverwalk in San Antonio, Texas.
 After exploring a potential bid for Amazon's HQ2, the City of San Antonio says it's no longer going to submit a proposal.
 The city conducted a ""robust review,"" but has ""determined that as aspirational as we are about our community's potential, we simply wouldn't be highly competitive from a real estate and incentives perspective,"" according to a city spokesperson.
A city spokesperson added that the door is open to Amazon ""should they choose to visit, but the types of incentive packages being entertained by other cities are not something our community is willing to entertain at this time.""
 San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg and Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff also wrote an open letter to Jeff Bezos explaing their decision, saying, ""it's hard to imagine that a forward-thinking company like Amazon hasn't already selected its preferred location,"" and ""the public process is creating a bidding war among states and cities.""
""Blindly giving away the farm isn't our style,"" the letter states. 
Responses to Amazon's request for proposals for their HQ2 location are due Oct. 19. The new campus is expected to employ as many as 50,000 people and cost over $5 billion to build and run.
Amazon has stated a few preferences for the bids they are considering. The company is looking at metropolitan areas with more than one million people, with a stable and business friendly environment, urban or suburban locations that can attract talent and communities that think ""big and creatively"" about real estate options.""
The letter from Nirenberg and Judge Wolff also states that no metropolitan area meets all of Amazon's requirements. ""That's why so many states and cities are attempting to lure Amazon largely using incentives. It won't surprise anyone if the winning incentive package exceeds the $3 billion that Wisconsin gave Foxconn last month.""

 Amazon Studios chief Roy Price on leave of absence amid sexual harassment claim   
 12:57  PM ET Fri, 13 Oct 2017 |  00:59 
 Amazon said Thursday that Amazon Studios chief Roy Price was on a leave of absence and the company was reviewing its projects with The Weinstein Company.
 ""Roy Price is on leave of absence effective immediately. We are reviewing our options for the projects we have with The Weinstein Co,"" an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC.
The Hollywood Reporter had reported earlier Thursday that an Amazon TV producer was claiming Price had sexually harassed her.
 Additionally, Thursday's announcement came soon after actress Rose McGowan went after Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos for his company allegedly ignoring her warnings about Harvey Weinstein.
In a series of tweets Thursday, McGowan attacked Bezos and the tech giant he leads for failing to hear her early claims about being ""raped"" by Weinstein and for ""funding rapists, alleged pedos and sexual harassers.""
McGowan was one of the people named in the recent  New York Times exposé about Weinstein's sexual harassment claims and is reported to have reached a settlement with the film producer.
It was not immediately clear what film script she was referring to or why she said Amazon won a ""dirty Oscar.""

 Some call for Twitter boycott after Rose McGowan is temporarily suspended   
 2:39  PM ET Thu, 12 Oct 2017 |  00:59 
 Rose McGowan is going after Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos for allegedly ignoring her warnings about Harvey Weinstein.
 In a series of tweets Thursday, McGowan attacked Bezos and his company for failing to hear her early claims about being ""raped"" by Weinstein and for ""funding rapists, alleged pedos and sexual harassers.""
McGowan was one of the people named in the recent New York Times exposé about Weinstein's sexual harassment claims and is reported to have reached a settlement with the film producer.
 It's unclear what film script she is referring to or why she thinks Amazon won a ""dirty Oscar."" But it's clear her fight against Weinstein is about to get a lot nastier.
McGowan's tweetstorm came moments after Twitter restored full service to her account. It had previously limited her functionality for violating its rules, the company said, because she posted a private phone number.
Here's McGowan's full tweetstorm:

 Analyst: Amazon to surge more than 25%   
 11:04  AM ET Thu, 12 Oct 2017 |  00:33 
 Amazon's stunning growth in a new unexpected market will boost the company's shares, according to a small Wall Street firm.
 Atlantic Equities reaffirmed its overweight rating for the e-commerce giant, predicting its ad sales will nearly quintuple during the next four years.
""Amazon's advertising business is growing in importance, representing an increasingly material source of profits as Sponsored Products continues to grow rapidly and more brand-oriented offerings are introduced,"" analyst James Cordwell wrote in a note to clients Thursday entitled ""Advertising's significance underappreciated.""
 ""With additional benefits in building relationships with consumer goods and apparel companies, we have increased confidence in Amazon's long-term revenue and margin potential.""
Cordwell raised his price target for Amazon shares to $1,250 from $1,120, representing 26 percent upside from Wednesday's close.
The analyst cited how the company's Sponsored Products sales grew more than 100 percent this year. The offering gives third-party sellers the ability to advertise on Amazon website's product search results. He predicts Sponsored Products sales will rise to $8.8 billion by 2020 from an estimated range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion last year.
""While Sponsored Products targets promotional ad dollars, we believe Amazon is also starting to focus on brand advertising,"" he wrote. ""This represents a major revenue opportunity, but could also be important in building broader relationships with major apparel brands.""
Cordwell predict Amazon's brand advertising sales will grow to $3.2 billion by 2020. As a result, he forecasts the company's total ad revenue will rise to $12 billion in four years from nearly $2.5 billion last year.
Amazon shares have rallied 33 percent this year through Wednesday, compared with the market's 14 percent gain.
Its shares are roughly flat in the Thursday premarket session after the report.

A worker packs customer orders at the Amazon fulfillment center in Romeoville, Illinois.
 Amazon is nearly doubling its fulfillment center workforce as it heads into the holiday season. 
 The company announced Thursday it's hiring 120,000 temporary employees to work in fulfillment centers across 33 states, adding to 125,000 existing full-time employees. 
""We look forward to welcoming back holiday employees who return year-after-year to Amazon and welcome new faces to the team, many of whom will continue on with regular, full-time roles with the company after the holidays,"" Dave Clark, Amazon senior vice president of global customer fulfillment, said in a statement. 
 New employees will help pick, pack and ship customers' holiday orders at the company's 75 fulfillment centers and could potentially be kept on after the season, according to a company release. 
The extra hands will likely prove useful as Amazon continues to experiment with ways to boost sales volume and get more packages in customers' hands. The company recently said it's allowing teens to shop on their own (with parental permission) and exploring delivery options for your home and car.

 Amazon is winning the smart home speaker battle.
 New data from Strategy Analytics suggest that Amazon's Alexa smart assistant is beating Google in the home. Strategy Analytics found that Amazon Alexa will be on 68 percent of all smart speakers by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. This includes Echos built by Amazon and other products built by third parties that also run Alexa. Sonos will soon launch a speaker running Alexa, for example. 
It's no surprise Amazon has such a large share. It has a huge selection across price ranges, including a low-cost Echo Dot speaker that costs about $35 when on sale, a full-size Echo for $179 and even the Echo Show, which has a screen built-in for video chat. It also just introduced several new products that will be available before the year is up.
 Google's slice of the pie came will come in at 24 percent of all sales during the fourth quarter, Strategy Analytics said. Google most recently released its more affordable Google Home Mini speaker, though its launch was rocky at best. One reporter found the device was recording him without his permission, a problem that Google ultimately patched.
Strategy Analytics said Amazon, Google and Chinese-firm Baidu will run the smart home speaker market until about 2020, when the firm expects all three will leave hardware development to third parties.
Apple, which will launch its HomePod Siri-powered smart speaker by the holidays, was not mentioned in the report.

 Target shoppers nationwide will now be able to make purchases on Google Express, after a successful test on the platform in California and New York, the company announced Thursday.
 The big-box retailer is among several that are deepening their relationships with Google's voice-activated shopping platform in a battle for market share against Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices.
Target announced that by 2018, the retailer's credit card holders will be able to link their cards and save 5 percent when shopping Target via Google Express. Shoppers will also have an option in 2018 to link their Target.com accounts to Google for a more personalized experience, similar to what Wal-Mart announced earlier this year.
 For example, a shopper might say to the Google Assistant on Google Home: ""Google, order me shampoo."" If that shopper has accounts linked both to Target.com and Walmart.com, but he or she orders shampoo more frequently from Target, Google will pull results from Target's website.
Target's product assortment on Google Express will include anything in a typical Target store, which will serve as fulfillment centers. In 2018, shoppers will be able to pick up their Target purchases made via Google Express at Target stores, should they want to forgo waiting on a shipment.
""Target and Google teams are working on the next chapter, building experiences that digitally replicate the joy of shopping a Target store to discover stylish and affordable products,"" said Target's chief information and digital officer, Mike McNamara.
In tandem with Target's roll-out on Thursday, Google has also unveiled plans to grow the number of ways customers can use the Google Assistant.
Until now, the voice platform has been available on the Google Home and on Android TVs. Soon, it will launch on iPhones and Android phones, so customers can order items, using voice, while mobile.
""At Google, we are focused on continued innovation and making Google Express a platform to help retailers like Target offer consumers a high quality seamless, end-to-end shopping experience,"" said Daniel Alegre, Google's president of retail and shopping.
Other retailers on the Google Express platform include Wal-Mart, Costco, Kohl's and Ulta, according to Google's website.
Earlier this month, Wal-Mart announced that shoppers could browse more than 2 million of the big-box retailer's items via Google Express. Wal-Mart was also giving shoppers coupons if they bought a Google Home or Google Home Mini, and linked their Walmart.com accounts to Google Express.
Bulking up against internet giant Amazon, more and more retailers have been touting their partnerships with Google and encouraging shoppers to buy Google devices. To be sure, the penetration of Google Home devices in American households is still less than that of Amazon's Echo devices.
Companies, like Wal-Mart and Target are still finding ways to grow with Google, promising more to come.
""Next year, we will also leverage our 4,700 U.S. stores and our fulfillment network to create customer experiences that don't currently exist within voice shopping anywhere else,"" Marc Lore, head of Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce business, said in a blog post.
This will include using voice command to pick up orders in store and using voice shopping to purchase fresh groceries, he said.
Target likewise initially won't offer fresh groceries via Google Express, a representative told CNBC. But it has plans to grow in other areas with voice-enabled shopping, like apparel, home and beauty, the company said.
Today, for example, shopping for dry goods like coffee and paper towels through voice-enabled devices is more easily accomplished than picking out an outfit, where there are many more factors involved. But Target is aiming to perfect the response to shoppers telling the Google Assistant, ""Google, find me a red dress.""
Google and Amazon are pledging more voice-shopping opportunities.

 Warehouse boon fueled by Amazon's expanding need for space: Black Creek Group president   
 7:06  AM ET Thu, 12 Oct 2017 |  03:17 
 It might sound counterintuitive, but brick-and-mortar store-killer Amazon may be boosting parts of the real estate market.
 The e-commerce giant has ""made the warehouse sexy,"" Raj Dhanda, president of private equity real-estate firm Black Creek Group, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday. Big and bulky warehouses have rapidly become the ""hottest"" component of commercial real estate, Dhanda said.
During the first half of the year, investment sales in the industrial real estate sector totaled $23.8 billion, according to real estate investment firm Jones Lang LaSalle. That translated to growth of more than 20 percent.
 JLL predicts that ""another wave of large-scale industrial portfolio transactions will lead second-half activity."" More than $12.5 billion in industrial deals are slated to close before the end of the year, the firm found.
Amazon isn't the only e-retailer that needs distribution centers — more and more are looking to scoop up spaces outside of metropolitan markets to plant their fulfillment facilities.
In turn, rents in the industrial sector have climbed around six to seven points, according to Dhanda. His team has noticed more activity in second-tier markets around Dallas, Denver and Nashville, Tennessee.
Publicly traded real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are one way investors can get a piece of the commercial action, particularly warehouses. Dhanda said he's noticed more investors turning to real estate in a search of assets that aren't tied to the typical ebb and flow of the stock and bond markets.
Share prices of industrial REITs Prologis, DCT Industrial Trust, EastGroup Properties are up more than 22 percent each this year. The price of another REIT, First Industrial Realty Trust, is up about 10 percent.
""As retailers reconfigure their supply chain to accommodate the shift in consumer behavior, the requirement for warehousing space will increase substantially,"" Stag Industrial CEO Ben Butcher told CNBC earlier this year. ""This is true incremental demand, not a displacement of existing demand for warehouse square footage."" 
Butcher's industrial REIT has seen its stock climb over 17 percent in 2017.
Jefferies has added to the argument for industrial companies, estimating that purely e-commerce retailers will need three times as much warehouse space as brick-and-mortar retailers, presenting huge opportunity for warehouse landlords.
While mall and shopping center stocks have cast a shadow over REIT equities this year, dropping on talk of a so-called retail apocalypse, there are hardly enough warehouses to keep up with industry demand, Dhanda told CNBC.
""What we've seen in 18 months is outsized returns for these industrial warehouse logistics assets — up 20 percent this year,"" he said.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a company conference in London in November 2014.
 For the second time in recent months, Amazon and Microsoft are teaming up in artificial intelligence, with Google on the sidelines for now.
 On Thursday the two companies rolled out new tools that will make it easier for developers to use open-source artificial intelligence software. This follows the companies' move in August to let its virtual assistants Alexa and Cortana talk with each other as needed.
Getting into the technical weeds, developers can use Gluon, a Python-based application programming interface, to more easily work with MXNet, the AI framework backed by public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services. And in the near future Gluon will make it easier for developers to use the Cognitive Toolkit, the framework that Microsoft open-sourced in 2015. The two companies are publishing the specifications for Gluon so that other frameworks can adopt it, too.
 Google is the elephant in the room here. Google open-sourced the TensorFlow AI framework in 2015, and it has since become very popular among researchers -- considerably more popular than the Cognitive Toolkit and MXNet:
 https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/915366704401719296
 Notably, Google is not among the companies promoting Gluon at this point. (Google declined to comment.) People who wish to use TensorFlow might find it easier to do that with a Google-backed Python API called Keras.
The announcement comes a few months after Apple introduced the Core ML software that's meant to help developers incorporate AI into iOS apps. Apple also released tools for converting models based on other frameworks into its Core ML format.
""We believe it is important for the industry to work together and pool resources to build technology that benefits the broader community,"" Eric Boyd, corporate vice president of Microsoft's AI and Research group, is quoted as saying in a statement. ""This is why Microsoft has collaborated with AWS to create the Gluon interface and enable an open AI ecosystem where developers have freedom of choice.""

Jeff Bezos
 Google and the country's biggest brick-and-mortar retailers have one main problem in common: Amazon. Now both sides are acting like they are serious about working together to do something about it.
On Thursday, Target and Google announced that they are expanding what was a years-old delivery partnership from a small experiment in a handful of cities to the entire continental U.S.
The expansion will allow Target to become a retail partner in Google's voice-shopping initiative, which lets owners of the Google Home ""smart"" speaker order items through voice commands like owners of the Echo can do from Amazon.
 The announcement comes seven weeks after  Walmart inked a similar deal with Google to offer hundreds of thousands of products through the service. Other big-box retailers like Home Depot are also on board.
Voice commerce was the core of these recent announcements, and it may someday become popular for types of shopping like reordering household staples. But that's not what is most interesting here to me.
Instead, it's the promise that Target is also beginning to work with Google ""to create innovative digital experiences using ... other cutting-edge technologies to elevate Target's strength in style areas such as home, apparel and beauty.""
""Target and Google teams are working on ... building experiences that digitally replicate the joy of shopping a Target store to discover stylish and affordable products,"" Target's digital chief Mike McNamara said in a press release.
If I were a betting man, I'd wager that augmented reality will be one of the areas where the two sides will seriously explore a way to work together. A Target spokesperson said it's too early to provide details on future partnerships between the companies.
One reason for my guess: The use of the phrase ""digitally replicate the joy of shopping"" above, which sounds like a hint at either augmented or virtual reality.
Another reason: Just this week, at the Shoptalk Europe conference, Google's director of augmented reality, Greg Jones, pitched retailers in the audience on working together, and made the case why Google and retailers' interests are aligned.
While nodding to the obvious threat Amazon poses to retailers, Jones admitted that the e-commerce giant is ""also a threat to Google, since a lot of people are going to Amazon first when it comes to product search."" There is  plenty of data to back that up.
Google has already worked with retailers like Lowe's to use augmented-reality technology — which 
allows digital objects to be overlaid on the real world
 when viewed through a phone's screen — to  help shoppers find the products they are looking for when in a store.
 And the tech giant has also worked with Pottery Barn on an augmented-reality app that lets shoppers get a visual idea of what a new piece of furniture will look like in their home. Ikea, Houzz and Wayfair have built similar solutions in their apps.
Jones also told the audience that Google would be building its own augmented-reality apps focused on the retail world. In a brief interview after his presentation, Jones said one goal of this initiative is to give a wide range of shoppers the benefits of AR features without requiring them to download a different app for every retailer they frequent.
To be sure, one voice-shopping or augmented-reality partnership won't be the difference between thriving or failing in an increasingly Amazon-led world. But a series of smart partnerships over several years between Google and big retailers will give both sides the best chance at fighting back. They sure need each other.

 Google and Amazon are ready to disrupt small business lending   
 11:07  AM ET Fri, 13 Oct 2017 |  00:53 
 Tech behemoths Google and Amazon are poised to put competitive pressure on traditional banks in the small business lending arena, one of former President Barack Obama's cabinet members said Tuesday.
 Karen Mills, who served as Obama's administrator for small businesses, told CNBC that the tech giants would probably push to disrupt the market and deal a blow to established lenders.
""I think they are going to dominate the market, and that is the next phase that's coming,"" she told the LendIt Europe fintech conference in London.
 ""But the question is, in what form would that come, and... under what regulatory authority?""
Earlier this year, Amazon said it had lent more than $1 billion in small business loans to merchants looking to expand their businesses, via its website.
Online business loans have increasingly become the priority of a number of financial technology (fintech) lenders. U.S. digital lender Lending Club, for instance, allows investors to loan money directly to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
""When I look at it from a U.S. view and a global view, the banks are going to come back in full force, including Barclays and others, and then on top of that you're going to have definite presence of Amazon players,"" Mills told CNBC in an interview after the conference.

Karen Mills, small business administrator (SBA), speaks during a House Small Business Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on June 6, 2012 in Washington, DC.
 ""Amazon has clearly signaled they're going to provide at least financing for their merchants that they know. And that's very smart.""
The former politician, who is now a fellow at Harvard Business School, said ""information aggregators in the days of artificial intelligence"" — like Google — would also have a competitive advantage.
""If you think about what Amazon already knows about its merchants, and then you think what Google knows about everybody who is buying and selling through its platform, one can imagine a world where they have much more information about both on the credit side but also on the small business itself.""
 Regulatory backdrop
 Mills' comments come amid rumblings of financial regulation for fintech firms.
In the U.S., a debate has erupted over whether the federal government should grant technology companies special banking charters that allow them to compete with banks nationwide.

 OCC speaks out on financial tech regulations   
 1:07  PM ET Thu, 31 March 2016 |  03:01 
 ""I think this is one of the as-yet-untold stories of fintech,"" Mills said.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), one of many regulators in the U.S., sparked opposition from state regulators and banks when it published guidance last year about the possibility of a national bank charter for fintech companies.
Mills said there is currently a ""spaghetti soup"" of multiple financial authorities, including the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But she added that there is currently little oversight over small business lenders.
She claimed there is a present fear among both traditional lenders and fintech companies that established internet giants may step up to the plate.
""If you look at the small business hierarchy needs, they need access to cash, funds, they need time, and they need more sales,"" she said.
""And what if you were able to provide an efficient system that gave them more time to do all their work, access to capital and something that boosts their sales line? You could see how that player could win over a traditional player or even a new fintech.""

Amazon's European headquarters, in the Clausen Valley in Luxembourg.
 President Trump and congressional lawmakers are not the only ones interested in  collecting taxes on global profits that American corporations are hoarding overseas. European regulators, knee deep in their own campaign to stamp out tax avoidance, have their own plans for that money.
Last week, for instance, the European Commission  billed Amazon for $293 million in unpaid taxes in Luxembourg, arguing that the country's failure to collect the tax amounted to an illegal state subsidy. It also took Ireland to court for not following up on the $15.2 billion tax bill imposed on Apple last year.
""The Europeans are targeting U.S. dollars overseas that the U.S. believes should be taxed here,"" said Dave Camp, a former Republican representative from Michigan who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the author of an  unsuccessful tax overhaul in 2014. ""We have to address this problem before the Europeans get there first.""

The rulings on Amazon and Apple — which those companies are disputing — are byproducts of a race among governments to lure corporate giants to their shores in the hunt for new sources of revenue. That cutthroat competition is the reason that 73 percent of Fortune 500 companies have a subsidiary in a low-tax haven, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
That rivalry has the potential to fuel tensions between the United States and its allies. Yet it could turn out that the European crackdown on American multinationals will ultimately help — rather than hobble — Washington's efforts to get them to pay up. The harder that other countries make it for American companies to take advantage of tax havens and sweetheart deals abroad, the weaker the incentives are for businesses to stash money out of the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.
Republican leaders have already put at the center of their tax rewrite an idea borrowed from Europe and other countries: Replace the system of taxing the worldwide profits of a domestic corporation with one that taxes only profits earned within its own territory.
""If we don't move to a more modern system, we may lose the ability to gain that revenue,"" Mr. Camp warned.
Multinationals will inevitably shop around for low rates. Americans and foreign companies have all played the same games, shifting patents and copyrights, profits and royalties to places with no or low corporate tax rates, like the  Cayman Islands and Bermuda. (The I.R.S. itself went after Amazon over assets it transferred to a Luxembourg unit, but Amazon  ultimately prevailed.)
Efforts to cooperate have not always been successful, but there are signs that coordination can help. The Europeans' effort is gradually shutting down the most notorious tax dodges that route corporate cash through Ireland and Luxembourg, said Michael J. Graetz, a professor and tax specialist at Columbia Law School.
""Those are like dinosaurs,"" he said. ""They're moving towards extinction.""
And a new rule adopted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, requiring multinationals to report their income and tax bill in  each country, will make it easier for the more than 60 governments that have signed on to monitor how much is actually collected.
So far, the team of Trump administration officials and lawmakers who drew up the latest framework for rewriting the tax code has released mostly general principles.
Now the I.R.S. taxes the worldwide profits of American corporations, but the tax kicks in only after that income is repatriated to the United States. As a result, American multinationals simply don't bring much of it home. Republicans have made clear they intend to switch to taxing only profits earned within the United States, what's known as a territorial system.
The $2.6 trillion in foreign profits that corporations already parked overseas in order to escape paying the I.R.S. would be required to be repatriated — although taxed at a steep discount. And there are promises to prevent the tax base from shrinking, and discourage businesses from putting more operations and earnings overseas. At the same time, the official corporate rate would be slashed to 20 percent, from 35 percent, to make American companies more competitive with their foreign rivals.
But this frame still lacks a picture, missing the details of how to accomplish those ambitious if sometimes conflicting goals.
Without tough safeguards, for example, the shift away from a worldwide system could end up curbing rather than promoting investment at home as American companies move even more operations overseas to avoid paying any United States taxes.
To some experts, like Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College, the only way to prevent American companies from exploiting loopholes in a new territorial regime is with a minimum tax. If a company's tax rate fell below the floor in, say, Bermuda, it would have to pay the difference to the I.R.S.
Other experts, though, suggest borrowing another idea to broaden the tax base from foreign tax regulators — like more aggressive efforts to tax foreign multinationals.
As the Amazon and Apple cases show, ""the politics in Europe are to tax somebody else's multinationals, particularly ours,"" said Mr. Graetz of Columbia.
""All of these other countries are basically trying to beef up and protect their tax base by ensuring foreign multinationals pay tax on income earned in their country,"" he added, ""and not on income earned by their own domestic multinationals.""
This is a different tack from the one taken in the United States, where tax dodges by homegrown billion-dollar corporations have been criticized for increasing the tax burden on companies that can't shield assets.
The complaint that the American tax code favors foreign multinationals over domestic ones did, however, arouse interest last week at Senate hearings on a tax overhaul.
""The United States corporate and international tax rules are an anticompetitive mess,""  said Itai Grinberg, a law professor at Georgetown University. And one of their most senseless features, he added, is the tax advantage that permits foreign-owned corporations to artificially strip out their earnings in the United States.
Both he and  Bret Wells, a law professor at the University of Houston, testified that foreign and American companies should be treated the same way.
Leveling the playing field does not necessarily have to wait for a rewritten tax code. Adam Looney, a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at the Treasury Department, said the Trump administration could take a step now. He urged the president to reverse a decision to  delay an Obama-era regulation to limit foreign companies' tax advantages and prevent them from transferring out their earnings.
""Without the regulations, American-owned businesses will be worse off,"" while foreign multinationals avoid about $7.4 billion in United States taxes, Mr. Looney wrote this week in a  policy brief for the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.
The delay, he said, means that the United States is, in effect, paying ""foreign investors to take over our companies with our own tax dollars.""

 Amazon and Google occupy a huge portion of the corporate psyche.
Both have long elicited fear, admiration and inspiration as evidenced by the frequency with which both companies are cited on conference calls across industries.
But Amazon has replaced Google as the corporate boogeyman. Amazon was mentioned 2,090 times this year on publicly available corporate conference calls (including earnings calls, shareholder meetings, and guidance calls), up 11 percent from last year, according to an analysis of FactSet data, which goes through the morning of Oct. 11, 2017. Google (or Alphabet) was mentioned in about 1,500 company conference calls, down 19 percent from 2016.
 In these conference calls, investors are often simply reacting to Amazon's presence or  expected presence in an industry. Amazon just had to announce that it was buying Whole Foods to send  grocery stocks reeling. Rolling out a  Geek Squad competitor caused Best Buy's stock to plunge. And Blue Apron has never been able to recover from the dark cloud that is Amazon dabbling in meal delivery.
Amazon and Google are on everyone's lips because it can seem like both have their hands in everything.
Amazon isn't just an online retailer but also a media company and a  brick-and-mortar grocery store. Google, among other pursuits, is a search engine, a driverless-car maker, a media company and an advertising behemoth through which Russians tried to steer the  U.S. presidential election.
Both companies compete over personal gadgets like their voice-controlled speakers Google Home and Amazon Echo that are becoming the centerpieces of connected homes. Both vie for control over the internet's backbone though their vast  data center businesses.
In short, both companies are drawing attention from their many competitors. Amazon is just a bit scarier.

 On a sunny day in July, commuters arriving at Union Station, in the shadow of Capitol Hill, were greeted with free bananas passed out by Amazon employees. In a Senate building, lawmakers and their aides attended policy panels on how Amazon manages privacy on its Echo devices and how sales for small businesses are booming on its online store.
The day was capped off with a cocktail reception hosted by Amazon's chief spokesman, Jay Carney -- the former press secretary to President Obama.
The public relations and lobbying push represents a new face for Amazon in Washington. Facing greater skepticism about its growing power over retail, including from President Trump, Amazon is following the well-worn path of oil, pharmaceutical and even other large tech companies, which try to bend policy in their favor by enhancing connections with federal officials.
 Amazon is sweeping the nation's capitol with a branding campaign of jobs creation and support for small businesses, promoting the upsides of its major expansion in media, groceries and transportation. This year, Amazon has increased its lobbying staff to 83 members from 60, making it one of the biggest corporate lobbying shops in town. The company is also on its way to surpassing its previous high for lobbying spending: $11.3 million last year. The $6.2 million Amazon spent in the first two quarters of this year was the 11th most among companies, above Exxon and far above Walmart, which spent $3.6 million in the same period.
The company's more aggressive approach, focused on building relationships with leading politicians and improving the company's overall reputation, is a break from its past. Before last year, the company relied on a no-frills operation for more than a decade, prodding officials in Washington on narrow laws and regulations and arguing about the nuances of issues like sales taxes and copyright.
The efforts may not directly apply to an imminent bill or regulation, but they allow the company to steer policy conversations that may be important to Amazon in the future. Amazon is hosting events for lawmakers, like the day of events in July, and holding discussions on transportation and labor policies for congressional staff and policy makers at its sleek offices near Capitol Hill. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and other political leaders have visited Amazon's fulfillment centers in their home districts, where Amazon talks up the thousands of jobs those warehouses support.
Amazon's strategic shift has happened as politicians are getting bolder in their criticism about the size and influence of big tech companies. Republicans and Democrats alike have focused on issues including antitrust, privacy and public disclosure.
Many of the harshest attacks have been directed at Facebook and Google, which also have robust lobbying arms in Washington. But Amazon has attracted its own set of vocal critics, who say the company's push into groceries, fashion, transportation and other industries threatens competition. President Trump has lashed out at the company and Jeff Bezos, the company's chief executive, multiple times, accusing the company of avoiding taxes among other things. The company has said it follows all tax laws and has supported a bill that would force online commerce sites to collect sales taxes.
''The concentration of power in the hands of a few companies has the potential to hurt the economy and consumers in the long run,'' said Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat who is the ranking member of the subcommittee that oversees antitrust matters. He raised concerns over Amazon's $13.4 billion purchase of Whole Foods over the summer, noting that antitrust laws may need an update to account for the power internet companies have over the economy.
Amazon, which declined to comment for this article, has said that its online retail business makes up a minority of all commerce and that it is producing tens of thousands of jobs in regions that have long been in decline. The company had 180,000 full-time employees in the United States at the end of 2016, nearly double its head count five years earlier. The company has said those gains help make up for the job losses from struggling brick-and-mortar retailers.

In the span of a few weeks this summer, Linda McMahon, head of the Small Business Administration, visited Amazon's headquarters in Seattle, where the company had small retailers on hand to talk about how Amazon had helped their businesses. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, attended the opening of a new fulfillment center in Edwardsville, Ill. And Senator Rob Portman, a Republican, visited a new fulfillment center in his home state of Ohio.
''Got to meet some of the 3,000+ Ohioans employed at this plant. #Jobs,'' Mr. Portman wrote on Twitter at the time.
''They are doing all this reputation stuff around how it is creating jobs and that's helped it generate a lot of media attention,'' said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of Institute for Local Self Reliance, a nonprofit group that promotes community economic development. Last year, her organization published a paper that argued the company was making it harder for smaller retailers to make money from selling on Amazon.
Amazon has also decided in recent years to spend more money in the broader influence ecosystem of Washington. In 2016, Amazon gave more than $10,000 each to 66 think tanks, lobbying groups and political organizations. More than a dozen organizations were new to its sponsorship roster, like the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Foundation and the conservative Law & Economic Center at George Mason University.
Financing Washington's ecosystem of research and lobbying groups is a common practice for tech companies such as Google and Microsoft, but Amazon had not been as active until recent years. Last month, it donated $50 million to a White House plan to promote computer science in classrooms.
Amazon is racing to catch up. Yet even with similar lobbying armies, Google and Facebook have not escaped criticism -- in their cases over their platforms' potential to shape public opinion.
''With Amazon, we need more transparency and need to look at longer term factors when it comes to competition,'' Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic Senator from Minnesota said in a recent interview. ''The people at the Justice Department in antitrust need to look at deals in other ways.''

 Lululemon says it gets good sales from brick-and-mortar and online in China   
 10:17  PM ET Sun, 15 Oct 2017 |  02:05 
 Canadian athletic apparel retailer Lululemon, hungry to expand, could lean further on Alibaba to drive growth, according to CEO Laurent Potdevin. 
 And while the relationship with China's e-commerce giant pays dividends, Lululemon isn't worrying about threats from its main U.S. rival: Some reports have said Amazon is planning to create its own sports apparel line, but Potdevin told CNBC the U.S.-based tech giant is unlikely to pose a direct threat to his company.
""I think Amazon is mostly around commodity product. That's not our sandbox,"" Potdevin said, explaining that Lululemon will continue to focus on innovation and on the high-end of the market.
 ""The fact that we control our distribution really allows us to have a different positioning,"" he said.
As for his company's Alibaba partnership — Lululemon products are available to consumers on Tmall, an Alibaba-run e-commerce site — Potdevin said it's integral for the business.
With Alibaba, ""there is really a passion for data, but not so much for the brands competing among themselves. So that relationship is really powerful and it translates to what we do offline both in our stores and through events,"" he said.
 Lululemon announced in August that it raked in $581.1 million in revenue for the second quarter — easily topping a projected $567.8 million. The figure was also a 13 percent year-over-year increase.
The company has said it plans to hit $4 billion in yearly revenue by 2020.

 Amazon Studios chief resigns after harassment allegations

 Amazon Studios chief Roy Price has resigned from his job after sexual harassment allegations surfaced, CNBC has confirmed. 
 Price was put on a leave of absence ""effective immediately"" last Thursday when reports emerged that he allegedly sexually harassed an Amazon TV producer. ""The Man in the High Castle"" producer Isa Hackett said Price made lewd comments towards her and propositioned her while she was promoting the show in 2015, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
Price lead Amazon Studios since Sept. 2014. During his tenure, Amazon became the first streaming platform to win a Golden Globe (""Transparent"") and get an Oscar nod for Best Picture (""Manchester by the Sea"").

 RBC's Mark Mahaney: The two big risks for Netflix   
 10:44  AM ET Tue, 17 Oct 2017 |  01:29 
 The biggest competitive risk to Netflix is Amazon launching a stand-alone streaming service for $7 a month, closely followed tech analyst Mark Mahaney told CNBC on Tuesday.
 ""If (Amazon) really pivots and want to go after Netflix and offer a stand-alone streaming subscription business for $7 a month, that would be Amazon-esque and that would cut at Netflix,"" said Mahaney, RBC Capital Markets' lead internet analyst.
""But I don't think Amazon wants to do that,"" Mahaney said in an interview on ""Squawk on the Street.""
 Amazon's membership program Prime gives customers access to video services. The company also offers a video-only plan, which costs $8.99 per month.
Mahaney spoke after Netflix's stock hit a record high Tuesday. On Monday, it posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue, boosted by stronger-than-expected subscriber growth. 
The company says it now has about 109.3 million subscribers globally.
In a post-earnings conference call, CEO Reed Hastings said the company's focus is on ""doing even better content, getting better partnerships, better mobile streaming.""
Netflix has ""accelerated their (subscriber) adds each and every year"" and it has the opportunity to scale its business internationally ""more than the market realizes,"" Mahaney said.
He added that Disney pulling out its movies won't impact Netflix internationally much. 
""They're able to grow with or without Disney in a lot of international markets,"" Mahaney said.

Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, founders of Snapchat.
 Snap just made a major move to compete with Netflix and Amazon.
 The social media company is partnering with NBCUniversal to create a digital content studio that makes original shows to debut on its Snapchat platform.
NBCUniversal, which already owns a stake in Snap, said it wants to take mobile TV programs ""to the next level.""
 ""As mobile audiences continue to grow, we're excited to expand the type of content we can develop,"" NBCUniversal's Lauren Anderson said Tuesday.
NBCUniversal has appointed Anderson to head the project as chief content officer. The executive, who previously was the broadcaster's senior vice president of primetime programming, developed and oversaw shows such as ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""The Office.""
""By combining the best-in-class creative expertise of NBCUniversal with the broad digital reach of Snapchat, we have the unique ability to take mobile programming to the next level, creating compelling shows for both viewers and advertisers,"" Anderson said.
Donut Studios co-founders Mark and Jay Duplass are also set to join the venture. The brothers are the brains behind HBO's comedy series ""Togetherness"" and the Netflix drama film ""Blue Jay.""

 Tough year for Snap
 Snap's stock price has had a rough year.
After debuting on the New York Stock Exchange in early 2017, Snapchat's parent has faced disappointing earnings results and a decline in users.
Since March, the stock has gone from an all-time high of $29.44 to as low as $13.10 in July. Shares of the Snap were at $16.26 in premarket trading Tuesday.
NBCUniversal, CNBC's parent company, was a participant in Snap's initial public offering, investing $500 million in the U.S.-based start-up.

 NBCUniversal invests $500M in Snap

 Last September, Snap launched an initiative called ""Shows"" for its Discover platform, to release mobile TV-like content on Snapchat. The U.S. broadcaster was Snap's first partner for the programming.
Sean Mills, head of original content for Snap, said the company was ""thrilled"" with the closer collaboration with NBCUniversal, and said NBCUniversal has been ""amazing collaborators from the start.""
The move signals entry into a market dominated by firms such as Netflix and Amazon, both of which produce original TV content.
And a Facebook TV platform is on the horizon. Reports last month said the social media giant could spend as much as $1 billion on original TV content.

 The 'Amazon experience' goes live at Kohl's   
 12:52  PM ET Wed, 18 Oct 2017 |  00:43 
 Kohl's is officially in business with Amazon.
 Starting Wednesday, 10 Kohl's stores in the Los Angeles and Chicago markets will both sell Amazon's smart home products and accept the online retailer's returns. The arrangement should help draw more shoppers to Kohl's stores, and make it easier for Amazon's customers to bring back unwanted items.
The Wisconsin-based department store chain has quietly been working on an alliance with the e-commerce giant since the spring, Kohl's chief merchandising and customer officer, Michelle Gass, told CNBC.
 ""I really do think it's an example of two companies that can leverage each other's strengths,"" said Gass, who will take the retailer's chief executive position, succeeding Kevin Mansell, in May. Gass has been spearheading Kohl's partnership with Amazon.
""We're leaning into our store base, which is a competitive advantage for us,"" she added.
The kiosks selling Amazon products, such as the Echo or the Kindle, in Kohl's stores will be run entirely by Amazon, Gass explained. But for the returns process, Kohl's own employees will be doing the work. More than 70 additional stores will eventually be able to process Amazon returns, though Kohl's won't say if those launches will come ahead of the holidays.

The Amazon kiosk in a Kohl's department store.
 Amazon working with Kohl's just makes sense, according to Tiffany Hogan, an apparel analyst at Kantar Retail.
""[Kohl's] is one of the few department chains not closing stores, they're operationally focused, and they have a broad swath of stores with potentially a little extra space now,"" Hogan told CNBC.
Kohl's laid out plans earlier this year to whittle its square footage over time, but that doesn't entail shuttering stores altogether. Chief Executive Mansell has said that trading in some of Kohl's larger stores for pint-size locations would help the company maintain its presence in different markets and operate more profitably.
Should Kohl's hold on to some of its bigger boxes — even as it trims back excess inventory — the leftover floor space could become a ""testing ground"" for Amazon's next private-label fashion line, Hogan added. ""We could potentially see new Amazon lines popping up in Kohl's.""

 Amazon returns at Kohl's stores launching today   
 11:43  AM ET Wed, 18 Oct 2017 |  02:56 
 Kohl's incoming CEO said she wants to take things slow. ""For now, let's walk before we run,"" Gass told CNBC when asked about the retailer's future with Amazon.
From an operational standpoint, Kohl's has already shown it's keen to making upgrades within its stores ahead of Wednesday's launches in Los Angeles and Chicago. A new small-format location in Cincinnati, for example, features a centralized checkout near the store's entrance — placing shoppers in a single line ahead of registers — along with a redesigned kiosk for online ordering.
Kohl's shares have fallen roughly 12 percent since the start of the year, but that's a far cry from the declines logged by some of its peers, like Macy's, which has seen its stock sink more than 44 percent over the same period.
""Kohl's struggles like all department stores, but I would certainly say they've moved forward from where they were a year ago,"" GlobalData Retail managing director Neil Saunders told CNBC. ""They're trying to drive customer traffic to stores, and the Amazon deal is the latest example of that.""
Kohl's has been testing other new initiatives, like entering a partnership with Under Armour to sell the sports apparel company's merchandise. Management said on a conference call in August that it's beginning to see benefits from inventory management and cost-cutting efforts.
""Under Armour in particular continued a very strong performance and beat the sales plan across almost all categories,"" Mansell told analysts and investors. ""We've gained significant share in active apparel and footwear in the first half of the year and expect that to continue in the back half based on assortment improvements and our momentum.""
The problem for Kohl's still, according to Saunders, is that the retailer's brand image ""isn't as powerful as it should be."" When asked what Kohl's stands for, he said, most U.S. shoppers would likely pause and say: ""I'm not actually sure.""
These are the first 10 Kohl's stores, out of 82, to handle Amazon returns:

 });The Sonos One is the best speaker I've ever heard with Amazon Alexa built-in, but you don't need to upgrade if you already have Sonos speakers in your house.I spent the last week or so with the Sonos One, adding it to an existing set of Sonos speakers in my house, and I think it's exactly where Sonos needed to take its line of speakers. On the other hand, folks who already have Sonos speakers at come can get similar functionality for less.I'll explain in a bit.The Sonos One replaces the Sonos Play:1 (on the left and right, respectively) as the company's new entry-level $199 speaker. If you haven't heard of Sonos, it made a name for itself offering really full-sounding speakers that can be placed in various rooms around the house. With connected functionality, users can stream from connected music services including Spotify, Apple Music and more. There's nothing better than walking from the living room to the dining room and into the kitchen hearing the same Miles Davis song play throughout, perfectly balanced as if you'd never walked away from the speaker.The Sonos Play One has embedded microphones and Amazon Alexa on board. That means you can ask the Sonos anything you'd ask one of Amazon's Echo products, such as the weather, to control your lights, to play certain songs and more. It works just as well as the Echo, I found, though lacks some of the Echo's more Amazon-y features, like the ability to call other Echoes. I also loved that, when asking it to play music, it sounded so much better than the Echo I already owned.There are a few small changes, like the new controls on the top of the Sonos that replace physical buttons found on the original Play:1.

Jeff Bezos
 Few things unite a Republican stalwart like Roy Blunt and a Democratic firebrand like Claire McCaskill. But the prospect of a political win prompted the two U.S. senators to put aside their differences this week — and  practically plead with Amazon to plop its new headquarters in their shared home state of Missouri.
In doing so, the duo joined a growing group of federal lawmakers — from Pennsylvania to Texas — who are actively angling for the e-commerce giant's second corporate outpost, dubbed HQ2. The new hub could generate 50,000 new jobs and $5 billion in fresh Amazon investment wherever it ultimately lands, at least in the company's eyes.
For members of Congress, though, this sort of race to capture corporate cash and attention always presents an immense contradiction. Enticing new jobs and dollars sometimes means that lawmakers must woo the very businesses that they're supposed to be regulating with a far more objective eye.
 And they face a special challenge when it comes to Amazon, a tech behemoth that has long faced criticism for its hyperaggressive tactics as it conquers new industries, from entertainment to cloud computing to smart-home devices.
""I do think it puts people in a difficult situation, because obviously, on the one hand, you want to speak out strongly on issues of privacy, on issues of antitrust, on issues of tax [compliance],"" said Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who represents a slice of Silicon Valley, in an interview with Recode. ""But I think also many of these members say, 'Look, 50,000 jobs in our environment, which may not require college degrees, is like winning the lottery.'""
At times, it seems like a precarious balance for lawmakers to strike.
Earlier this year, for example, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker  sounded alarms about Amazon's most recent gambit: Its $14 billion purchase of Whole Foods. At the time, Booker told Recode that the deal — which the U.S. government later approved — could create new headaches for disadvantaged communities already lacking in grocery options.
By October, Booker nonetheless saw new opportunity in Amazon's desire to set up a shop outside of its Seattle roots. In time for the company's Oct. 19 application deadline, Booker joined New Jersey's unpopular Republican governor, Chris Christie, to pitch Newark as the best site for HQ2. Local regulators also promised Amazon a whopping $7 billion in tax breaks if it located its future hub in the city where Booker previously served as mayor.
""Amazon would be smart to come here,""  Booker said at a recent press conference.
His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
'Bend over backwards'
Federal lawmakers aren't just groveling for their own sake at the feet of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Along with governors and mayors from their states, they're trying to fulfill the pledges they've made to voters — to create new economic opportunities and boost the availability of high-paying jobs.
That's why Wisconsin pols — including House Speaker Paul Ryan — set about offering $3 billion in tax subsidies this year to another company, Foxconn,  which is now set to build a new factory there. Local and federal officeholders in Virginia similarly worked with Facebook to secure its investment in a new 970,000-square-foot data center in the state.
""Facebook's partnership with Virginia and this significant investment in Henrico County are great news for the region,""  Sen. Mark Warner said this October.
But these efforts are immensely beneficial for tech giants, too. Beyond favorable tax treatment and other financial perks, the deals allow companies in Silicon Valley and beyond a chance to make nice with their regulators — no small advantage at a time when the whole of the industry is under intense fire in the nation's capital.
Warner, for example, is  probing Facebook right now, amid evidence that Russian agents coopted the social media site to influence the 2016 presidential election. He is even set to grill one of Facebook's executives at a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee next month.
Amazon's political agenda is immense. To start, the company has a great deal at stake as the U.S. Congress wades into debates over tax and immigration reforms. It also faces flack for its size, as lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren question whether tech platforms in general are too large for their own good.
And Amazon has a  public enemy in the White House: President Donald Trump has regularly lambasted the company's leader, Bezos, for his ownership of The Washington Post, even claiming that the newspaper allows the tech giant to dodge U.S. taxes.
Those obstacles have driven Amazon to spend roughly $6.1 million to lobby federal officeholders so far this year, according to federal ethics filings. By the end of 2017, Amazon could even break its lobbying record in Washington, D.C. And in the eyes of the company's skeptics, regulatory concerns could shape the Amazon's thinking about how — and where — to situate its next corporate headquarters.
""It's striking to me that Amazon has created this situation in which elected officials across the country are signaling to their constituents that Amazon is a great company ... and that we should bend over backwards to try to subsidize and support their expansion,"" said Stacy Mitchell, the co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. The group has battled with Amazon in the past.
'We look for you to be a partner in that endeavor'
To Rep. Khanna, at least, his fellow lawmakers aren't entirely ""motivated by political interest"" as they try to woo Amazon's HQ2.
""Right now, it's the absence of any federal policy"" — a more organic, government-led efforts to bring jobs and investment to areas outside Silicon Valley — ""that has every member of Congress out for themselves making a sales pitch,"" he said in an interview.

Whatever the cause, the courtship from the nation's capital continues.
In Missouri, for example, McCaskill and Blunt hope their public plea might give a boost to cities like Kansas City and St. Louis. In their missive, sent Monday, they highlighted to Amazon the ""smoother ride"" of the state's transportation system, its easy access to airports, its trails for joggers and walkers alike — and, yes, its hip startups, too.
If it seemed too cute, it's probably Amazon's fault: The company, after all, told cities and states that it would give great weight to localities that boast the right transportation and infrastructure on top of the best tax terms.
A spokeswoman for McCaskill, however, rejected the notion that the Democratic lawmaker might ease up on the e-commerce giant if Missouri ultimately wins Amazon's office sweepstakes. ""She's never hesitated to take on tech companies when they disagree,"" the aide told Recode, citing the fact that  McCaskill supports an anti-sex trafficking bill that the tech industry opposes.
Roughly 700 miles south, meanwhile, two powerful Republican senators from Texas sought to make their own sales pitch to Amazon last week.
""Everything is bigger in Texas, and that includes our economy, our skilled workforce, and our quality of life,"" wrote  Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz in their letter to the company.
At the moment, big cities like  Austin and  lesser-known parts of the Lone Star State appear to be vying for Amazon's HQ2. If one of those Texas towns lands the new headquarters, it could also deliver something of an added political coup for the likes of Cruz — a failed 2016 presidential candidate who may wish to burnish his business bona fides in a future White House bid.
In Delaware, Gov. John Carney  enlisted his state's representatives to the U.S. Congress, including Sens. Chris Coons and Tom Carper, in a bid to get Amazon's attention. Scores of Pennsylvania  lawmakers from both parties did the same, as cities like Philadelphia now vie to be the tech giant's second home.
And in Colorado, nine Democrats and Republicans who comprise the state's full congressional delegation banded together in their appeal. Cities like Denver are seen as some of the strongest competitors for Amazon HQ2, but the company has remained mum as to who, if anyone, is on its shortlist.
""Local, state and federal policy makers are committed to continuing the policies that have allowed our state to thrive,"" the group of pols wrote, ""and we look for you to be a partner in that endeavor.""

Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe Chief Eric Thompson next to the Saint Lawrence River in upstate New York. The tribe aims to diversify its economy through patent partnerships.
 The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which captured headlines last month for its unusual patent deal with drugmaker Allergan, is doubling down in the patent space, Wednesday filing lawsuits against Microsoft and Amazon claiming patent infringement.
 The tribe is a co-plaintiff with small tech firm SRC Labs, which claims the tech giants have been infringing its patents on data processing technologies for years. The company and the tribe are seeking damages and royalties.
SRC transferred the patents to the tribe in early August, a month before the tribe's partnership with Allergan captured national headlines. Native American tribes possess sovereign immunity to patent challenges through a system known as inter partes review, and the partnerships with both Allergan and SRC are designed to shield the patents from those challenges.
 The Allergan partnership drew backlash from at least nine members of Congress, with one, Sen. Claire McCaskill, introducing legislation seeking to abrogate tribal sovereign immunity in this context.
Allergan said it struck the deal with the tribe to avoid the ""double jeopardy"" of defending its patents, on the blockbuster eye drug Restasis, in both the federal court system and through IPR challenges from generic-drug makers. Monday, a federal court judge invalidated the patents. Allergan said it will appeal.
The partnership with the SRC is designed to protect the patents from a counter-challenge from Microsoft and Amazon through the IPR system. Critics of IPR say it can tie patent holders up in perpetual legal limbo as challengers file repeated complaints, whereas patent challenges through federal courts are decisive. Proponents of IPR say it's vital for dismantling bad patents.
The tribe says its patent partnerships are part of its efforts to economically diversify, noting gaming revenue from a casino it operates has leveled off in recent years, and that it has significant health and economic challenges in its community. In the Allergan partnership, the pharmaceutical company paid the tribe $13.75 million after transferring the patent rights and then licensing them back exclusively.
The terms of the deal with SRC weren't immediately known.
""To overcome these economic disadvantages, the tribe took steps to diversify its economy with investments in innovative business and various enterprises to foster jobs and entrepreneurship,"" the tribe said in its complaint against Microsoft, filed Wednesday morning in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Amazon complaint was filed in the same court.
The tribe also said it's creating a technology and innovation center to promote modernization of its businesses, create revenue and jobs and ""promote the education of Mohawks in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math.""
Microsoft and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

 });On Wednesday, Amazon sent emails to qualifying customers to notify them that credit has been added to their accounts in response to the Apple eBook Antitrust Settlement.
 You were only eligible to receive credit if you had a U.S. billing address and purchased a Kindle book between April 1, 2010, and May 21, 2012, published by one of five major U.S. publishers: Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon & Schuster. 
The case, which was settled Nov. 21, 2014, addressed the question of whether Apple and the five listed publishers conspired to fix and raise the retail prices of eBooks. 
 ""Under the settlements, Apple provided funds for credits that were applied directly to Amazon accounts of eligible customers in June 2016,"" Amazon explains. ""These credits expired in June 2017. Customers who redeemed credits from the June 2016 distribution received additional credits in October 2017.""

 Is Amazon spreading itself too thin?   
 6:44  PM ET Wed, 18 Oct 2017 |  03:29 
 Amazon is spreading itself too thin, Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, told CNBC on Wednesday.
 The e-commerce giant creates technology from e-readers to smart speakers, produces original TV and movie content, dabbles in self-driving cars, and delivers alcohol, groceries and products from third-party sellers on its platform.
The company is also in the final stages of figuring out its strategy to get into the multibillion-dollar prescription drug market in addition to exploring ways to deliver items to your car trunk and the inside of your home.
 ""I do think Amazon is getting into the danger zone. History is littered with companies who used to be at the top of the Nasdaq who got into areas that really weren't part of their core business,"" Moorhead told CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""

 He specifically cites Cisco's move into consumer electronics, Dell's into TVs and Intel's choice to make microscopes for kids.
""I really think Amazon is at that point, like these other companies were, thinking that they can do no wrong,"" he said. ""So they really need to watch themselves.""
The corporation has had meetings about launching programs to bring more advertisers to its video platforms and make it a stronger competitor against YouTube. Moorhead pinpoints this as Amazon's breaking point.
""They've gone over the top by putting cameras in devices you never would have thought of [to deliver targeted ads]. ... I just think that's a step too far, and it could backfire because Amazon is one of the most trusted consumer brands out there,"" he said.

 Stitch Fix to list shares at Nasdaq   
 7:10  PM ET Thu, 19 Oct 2017 |  00:52 
 Online fashion seller Stitch Fix is concerned about Amazon as it marches towards an IPO. But not because of Amazon's e-commerce dominance.
 Stitch Fix, which sends personalized boxes of apparel -- or Fixes -- to its customers, outsources much of its technology infrastructure to Amazon Web Services. When there's an outage or slowdown, Stitch Fix's business and financial results can suffer. 
That's not a hypothetical scenario. In its IPO prospectus filed on Thursday, Stitch Fix said an AWS outage in February caused ""disruptions in applications that support our warehouse operations and order fulfillment that caused a temporary slowdown in the number of Fix shipments we were able to make.""
 It's a familiar conundrum across the retail space. Retailers view Amazon as both their greatest existential threat and one of their biggest technology suppliers, with the most sophisticated cloud infrastructure on the planet. Brands that use AWS include Brooks Brothers, Nordstrom, Nike, Under Armour and Lululemon. CNBC reported in August that Target is moving away from AWS amid growing competition with Amazon's core retail operation.

 Target moving away from Amazon Web Services -Sources   
 6:17  PM ET Tue, 29 Aug 2017 |  01:24 
 Stitch Fix doesn't name Amazon or any other company as a competitor. Rather, the company says generically in the filing that it competes with ""department stores, specialty retailers, discount chains, independent retail stores, the online offerings of these traditional retail competitors and eCommerce companies.""
A lot of venture money has poured into e-commerce start-ups in recent years, but those companies rarely go public. The best outcomes have been through acquisition, such as Wal-Mart's purchase of Jet.com and Unilever's purchase of Dollar Shave Club.
Stitch Fix is unique in that it's big and profitable. Net revenue climbed 34 percent in fiscal 2017 to $977.1 million, and the company recorded an operating income of $31.6 million. 
Stitch Fix touts its data science and ability to use algorithms to determine what customers will like based on their measurements, past preferences and what's popular with others they resemble.
Still, any company that's shipping clothing has to fend off Amazon.
For Stitch Fix, that's increasingly the case. In June, Amazon announced launched Prime Wardrobe, which lets customers order a box of clothes and jewelry and return what they don't want to keep. That means the company has at least two reasons to worry about Amazon.

 Some cities put off by Amazon's request for incentives in HQ2 bids   
 12:59  PM ET Mon, 23 Oct 2017 |  01:54 
 Amazon is wrapping up what amounts to a contest with a multibillion-dollar prize for the North American city that becomes the site of the online retailer's second headquarters.
 Based on the response, the company will have a tough time making a decision, and CNBC wants to help. 
To get the bidding started last month, Amazon promised to invest more than $5 billion and hire 50,000 people for its new headquarters, which it says will rival its sprawling Seattle campus in size and scope. In return, state and city governments are expected to offer generous tax benefits and other incentives.
 The result has been a flood of pitches from across the country, from big cities such as New York and Chicago to small regions such as Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania. More than 100 cities and counties have expressed interest.
Those proposals, due Thursday, sought to highlight each city's strengths, based on the wish list the company created to help it find the perfect spot for its new campus.
The list included a population of more than 1 million people, an international airport, mass transit, quality higher education, an educated workforce and a solid business climate.

 Here are the cities that match Amazon's wish list for its second headquarters   
 6:07  PM ET Thu,  7 Sept 2017 |  01:09 
 So, to help the world's largest e-commerce company narrow down its search, CNBC looked at some of the key criteria the online retailer laid out in its pitch to cities and states.To measure how prospective cities stack up, we started with a list of cities with at least 1 million people and then ranked them in five categories: local airport traffic, mass transit ridership, the number of accredited higher educational institutions, the share of the workforce with at least a college degree and the pace of job growth over the last 12 months.
 In its request for proposals, the company wasn't shy about asking states and cities to cough up incentives — from donated land to breaks on taxes and fees to relocation subsidies. In return, Amazon pointed to its Seattle headquarters as a sign of what it could bring to a new host city. Its workforce has grown to more than 380,000 from less than 25,000 since it moved to downtown Seattle in 2010, the company said.
""We want to find a city that is excited to work with us and where our customers, employees, and the community can all benefit,"" Amazon said.
The company has a strong track record of tapping state and local governments' generosity. Amazon has been awarded 70 state and local subsidies, totaling at least $732.79 million in value, since 2000, according to the nonprofit Good Jobs First. Texas leads the way with granting the most subsidy value to Amazon, followed by Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois, the group told Reuters. But it remains to be seen which cities and states will step up to participate in Amazon's bidding war.
Until then, the competitors can tout the infrastructure and workforce characteristics the company is targeting. When we ranked the top 20 cities in each of those criteria, some of them began to stand out.
 Beyond the incentives it gets from state and local governments, Amazon will need to secure enough land for a sizable complex. Its current Seattle campus includes 8.1 million square feet of space in 33 buildings and employs more than 40,000 people.The company said its new second headquarters would initially need more than 500,000 square feet and up to 8 million square feet beyond 2027. But first it needs to pick a city. To better rank them overall, we gave each city points based on how they rank in Amazon's criteria and then added up the score. Based on those results, Amazon might want to give New York, Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco and Boston a close look.
 Here's how we came up with our list: 
The company isn't limiting its search to the U.S. In its proposal, Amazon said it's looking for a location in North America, and asked for proposals from states, cities or provinces. For our search, given the challenges of locating in Cuba, Haiti or Guatemala, we limited the starting list to the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
With 11 cities of sufficient population, Mexico offers some intriguing prospects for an online retailer with global ambitions. Those cities play host to some of the features Amazon is looking for, including mass transit, international airports, and colleges and universities. But we eliminated Mexican cities for a simple, unscientific reason. It seems likely that Amazon would face enormous political backlash, especially from President Donald Trump, who has complained bitterly about companies moving jobs to Mexico. The president also has criticized Amazon for doing ""great damage"" to retailers, costing jobs in cities and states. (Not to mention Trump's Twitter broadsides against The Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.)
For the rest of Amazon's wish list, we looked at public transportation ridership, workforce educational attainment, local area job growth, airport passenger traffic and the number of accredited post-secondary education institutions in each city. For the top 20 in each category, we gave 20 points for the No. 1 rank, 19 points for the second rank, and so on. 
Amazon has said it will select the location sometime next year.

 Amazon's Jeff Bezos just opened a massive wind farm in Texas   
 9:37  AM ET Fri, 20 Oct 2017 |  00:40 
 Amazon has announced that its biggest wind farm to date is operational.
 In a statement on Thursday, the business said that Amazon Wind Farm Texas would add over 1 million megawatt hours (MWh) of clean energy to the grid annually.
The facility, which is located in Scurry County, has over 100 turbines, each standing more than 300-feet tall and with a rotor diameter over double the wingspan of a Boeing 787.
 Amazon said the wind farm was built, owned and operated by Lincoln Clean Energy, which develops wind and solar projects in the U.S. Amazon has entered into a long-term agreement to purchase 90 percent of the facility's output.
""Investing in renewable energy is a win-win-win-win – it's right for our customers, our communities, our business, and our planet,"" Kara Hurst, Amazon's worldwide director of sustainability, said in a statement Thursday.
 Bezos Tweet
 Hurst added that Amazon now had 18 wind and solar projects in the U.S., with over 35 still to come. ""These are important steps toward reaching our long-term goal to power our global infrastructure using 100 percent renewable energy,"" she added.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the United States is ""home to one of the largest and fastest growing wind markets in the world.""
Towards the end of last year, America's first offshore wind farm commenced commercial operations. The Block Island Wind Farm is located off of the coast of Rhode Island and is a 30-megawatt, five-turbine installation.

 Mayor Jason Lary: We'll rename part of our city Amazon, Georgia to get HQ2   
 3:08  PM ET Thu, 19 Oct 2017 |  03:02 
 In Amazon's search for a new campus, one Georgia mayor is upping the ante and offering the e-commerce giant an entire town. 
 Jason Lary, mayor of Stonecrest, Georgia, is willing to carve out 345 acres of the existing town to create a new jurisdiction with the name Amazon. 
""You think about the economic multiplier with regards to 50,000 jobs and a $5 billion investment over a 10-year period of time,"" Lary told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" Thursday. ""It's worth doing in every corner of the place."" 
 The new and still hypothetical town could have only one logical mayor. 
""Jeff Bezos can be the mayor, CEO, king, whatever they want to call it,"" Lary said. ""He'll be the first person to actually have a corporate city.""
Inhabiting its own town would mean Amazon could build on land just outside of Atlanta, establish an ""eternal brand"" in DeKalb County and have its own post office and mailing addresses, Lary said. 
Thursday's deadline to submit a proposal for Amazon's second headquarters saw a flurry of last-minute pitches. Some offered as much as $7 billion in incentives. Experts have narrowed the list to the top contenders.

29,2017-10-20,"Microsoft's noble attempt at a smart speaker isn't as good as the Google Home or Amazon Echo  This is Amazon's new Echo, and it's surprisingly nice for the price  Lululemon shares jump after Citi says Amazon fears are ‘overblown’  ","The Harman Kardon Invoke is Microsoft's answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home, but it isn't as good as those products.Microsoft didn't build its own smart speaker — as Amazon and Google did — but instead decided to outsource the hardware to Harman Kardon, an established player in the audio market. It's a towering speaker that fires 360-degree audio around the room and has built-in microphones to accept voice commands for Cortana.You can ask it things like ""what's the weather?"" and ""How tall is the Empire State Building?"" Or you can give it commands, like ""Remind me to pick up orange juice when I leave work.""The Invoke serves as a pretty decent speaker and easily filled the downstairs of my house with music. It sounds far better than the original Echo and the Google Home and looks more sophisticated than both.It's also pretty good at listening to commands, even when the speaker is playing, which is important. Google and Amazon have been able to do this pretty well, too, so the Invoke doesn't really stand out here.I like the dial on top, a direct copy of the volume controls on the Amazon Echo. It also has a soft glowing light that dances around the top when you give a command. A fun little touch: If you tap the top of the speaker, the Invoke will give you a random factoid.The Invoke can read out calendar reminders if you use Microsoft's Office 365 products, but it didn't work with my corporate Exchange account or Google Calendar. Microsoft said it plans to bring in additional calendars. I also liked asking it to read out the news in the morning, though this is something the Echo and Google Home can do just as well.The Invoke can be used to send reminders to the Cortana app on a smartphone. The feature worked well when I asked for a reminder to pick up orange juice, and I saw it pop up on my phone in the Cortana app.The Invoke also serves as a phone. Skype powers the experience but an unlisted number appears when you dial, so the receiver might not know it's you trying to call.Finally, you can use the Invoke to control smart devices in your house. It worked just fine for turning my Philips Hue lightbulbs on and off, which is really the only smart gadget I control by voice.The Invoke left a sour taste in my mouth that I couldn't shake. It wasn't always reliable and lacked so many features available in other products.For instance, I left the speaker playing while I hung out in my living room working and, on numerous occasions, music from Spotify completely stopped playing.Unlike the Echo and the Google Home, you can't use the Invoke to order products from grocery stores. That might sound unnecessary if you haven't used the Home or the Echo, but it's really convenient to walk through the living room and quickly ask to order toilet paper or other toiletries, and I missed that option.You can only listen to three music services right now: iHeartRadio, TuneIn and Spotify. That should cover a lot of folks but leaves out Pandora, the most popular streaming option, and other heavy hitters like Google Play Music and Apple Music.One more thing: The cord that plugs into the bottom of the Invoke is super short, which means you need to keep it close to an outlet. It's a weird design decision.Finally, unlike Google Home and Amazon Echo, the Invoke doesn't support multiroom audio, so you can't buy multiple units and play the same song in different rooms of your house. That's one of the best new features of the Echo and Home, and it's possible Harman Kardon might add this in an update.I really wanted to like the Invoke but I just couldn't warm up to it. As a Windows user, seamless integration with Cortana and my computer seemed really neat. I just wish it could do more and that it was more stable.It doesn't stand out against the more affordable Google Home or the Echo, the latter of which is getting a refresh this month with a new $99 model that's supposed to offer better audio. You can buy two of those (or four Google Home Minis, or four Echo Dots) for the price of the Invoke and still have almost all of the same features. You'll also gain multiroom audio, the ability to order products by voice and integration with hundreds of apps and services, including more music options.If you're chasing great audio, you might want to consider the Sonos One instead. It has Amazon Alexa built in and sounds better. Plus you can add multiple Sonos products to create a multiroom effect.Microsoft needs to play in this space. Apple's HomePod is coming out this year and, if Microsoft sat still, it would be the odd-ball out. It's on the right path with the Invoke, but still lags behind the pack.The Harman Kardon Invoke is Microsoft's answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home, but it isn't as good as those products.Microsoft didn't build its own smart speaker — as Amazon and Google did — but instead decided to outsource the hardware to Harman Kardon, an established player in the audio market. It's a towering speaker that fires 360-degree audio around the room and has built-in microphones to accept voice commands for Cortana.You can ask it things like ""what's the weather?"" and ""How tall is the Empire State Building?"" Or you can give it commands, like ""Remind me to pick up orange juice when I leave work.""The Invoke serves as a pretty decent speaker and easily filled the downstairs of my house with music. It sounds far better than the original Echo and the Google Home and looks more sophisticated than both.It's also pretty good at listening to commands, even when the speaker is playing, which is important. Google and Amazon have been able to do this pretty well, too, so the Invoke doesn't really stand out here.I like the dial on top, a direct copy of the volume controls on the Amazon Echo. It also has a soft glowing light that dances around the top when you give a command. A fun little touch: If you tap the top of the speaker, the Invoke will give you a random factoid.The Invoke can read out calendar reminders if you use Microsoft's Office 365 products, but it didn't work with my corporate Exchange account or Google Calendar. Microsoft said it plans to bring in additional calendars. I also liked asking it to read out the news in the morning, though this is something the Echo and Google Home can do just as well.The Invoke can be used to send reminders to the Cortana app on a smartphone. The feature worked well when I asked for a reminder to pick up orange juice, and I saw it pop up on my phone in the Cortana app.The Invoke also serves as a phone. Skype powers the experience but an unlisted number appears when you dial, so the receiver might not know it's you trying to call.Finally, you can use the Invoke to control smart devices in your house. It worked just fine for turning my Philips Hue lightbulbs on and off, which is really the only smart gadget I control by voice.The Invoke left a sour taste in my mouth that I couldn't shake. It wasn't always reliable and lacked so many features available in other products.For instance, I left the speaker playing while I hung out in my living room working and, on numerous occasions, music from Spotify completely stopped playing.Unlike the Echo and the Google Home, you can't use the Invoke to order products from grocery stores. That might sound unnecessary if you haven't used the Home or the Echo, but it's really convenient to walk through the living room and quickly ask to order toilet paper or other toiletries, and I missed that option.You can only listen to three music services right now: iHeartRadio, TuneIn and Spotify. That should cover a lot of folks but leaves out Pandora, the most popular streaming option, and other heavy hitters like Google Play Music and Apple Music.One more thing: The cord that plugs into the bottom of the Invoke is super short, which means you need to keep it close to an outlet. It's a weird design decision.Finally, unlike Google Home and Amazon Echo, the Invoke doesn't support multiroom audio, so you can't buy multiple units and play the same song in different rooms of your house. That's one of the best new features of the Echo and Home, and it's possible Harman Kardon might add this in an update.I really wanted to like the Invoke but I just couldn't warm up to it. As a Windows user, seamless integration with Cortana and my computer seemed really neat.

It's much smaller than a Sonos (I assumed it might be about the same size) and is much more stout than the original and tall Amazon Echo. Since it's bigger than the Echo Dot, it's able to pack a more powerful speaker but still isn't too big to clog up space on a bookshelf or side table.The new Echo is being sold with a variety of shells. You can buy it directly from Amazon in black, with a gray fabric finish, with an oak wood shell or in sandstone, silver or walnut. Amazon sent me an oak shell.You just push a button on the bottom of the Echo, the current shell slides off, and you can pop the new one on. I like the way this looks — it'll match my old house's decor better than my other Echos.The all-new Echo will be familiar to those who already own one. Amazon didn't change the controls on the top much — you'll still see volume, a mute button and the Alexa button. It has 7 microphones so that it can more accurately pick up voice commands. On the back, Amazon kept the 3.5 mm headphone jack in case you want to plug it in to other speakers. It also can double as a Bluetooth speaker.And if you're not familiar with Echo at all, they're more powerful than ever. You can use Amazon Alexa to ask questions (the weather or a recent sports score, maybe) or play content on your Amazon Fire TV, play music on multiple Echos around the house, call friends and more.I love the compact design so much that I can't help but think this would be perfect to toss into a backpack and take to the park. Amazon has a product for this called the Amazon Tap, but it's not as good. If the all-new Echo just had a small built-in battery for a few hours of playback unplugged, I'd like it even more.I think so. This is probably the Echo you want to buy now instead of the older original Echo, which costs $179. It's also better sounding than the Echo Dot. If you're just getting started with a smart home, however, you might want to consider buying the Echo Plus, which is bigger and costs $150. The Echo Plus includes a smart home hub, which means it should be a compelling product for folks who don't already have one. It'll automatically detect smart products with ZigBee and from brands including Kwikset, GE and Philips.PlayingShare this video...Watch Next...The all-new Amazon Echo just landed on my desk, and it's way nicer than I thought it would be, especially for $99.As an owner of several Amazon Echo products — including the smaller Echo Dot, original Echo and the screen-toting Echo Show — I didn't think I was going to buy any more.Now, I think maybe I need just one more in the house.The Echo is really compact.

 Lululemon will be one of few retail brands that can survive the Amazon onslaught, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Citi Research raised its rating for the company's shares to buy from neutral, predicting Lululemon will report earnings above expectations this year.
The call sent the stock up 2.2 percent at Friday's opening bell.
 ""We believe recent mkt concerns (Amazon, denim, weather) are overblown, and we believe current levels represent an attractive entry point for one of the best performing brands (and long term growth stories) in all of retail,"" analyst Paul Lejuez wrote in a note to clients Friday.
""We have more confidence in both the near and long term trajectory of the brand and its growth potential based on our discussions with mgmt.""
Lululemon stock has underperformed the market year to date with its shares down 7.5 percent through Thursday, compared with the S&P 500's 14.4 percent return.
The analyst raised his price target for the company's shares to $73 from $62, representing 21.5 percent upside from Thursday's close.
Lejuez played down the threat from Amazon due to Lululemon's strong brand and competitive position.
""We believe the stock has recently come under some pressure due to stories of Amazon developing an activewear line,"" he wrote. ""While Amazon's efforts are never anything to brush aside, we believe Lululemon would be one of the last companies impacted. We believe Amazon would be more of a threat to the younger, less-established brands that have not build a loyal customer base.""
The analyst cited Lululemon's 29 percent e-commerce sales growth in its second-quarter. He also noted the company's large expansion opportunities in Asia.
""We believe Lululemon has tremendous potential to grow in Greater China,"" he wrote. ""China has become a clear focus for management and we believe this momentum in China cannot be ignored.""
Lejuez raised his fiscal 2017 earnings-per-share estimate for Lululemon to $2.45 from $2.41 compared to the Wall Street consensus of $2.41.

From left Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Larry Page, and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg listen during a meeting with technology industry leaders at Trump Tower in New York, NY on Wednesday, Dec. 14, 2016.
 The busiest week of the earnings season is here, and there are 10 companies investors are betting will top Wall Street's expectations.
 CNBC used Estimize, which pools thousands of estimates from real investors and traders, to sort through the many companies reporting over the next week and find the ones where this group had higher expectations than the standard Wall Street consensus estimate from analysts.
About a third of the S&P 500 is expected to have reported quarterly earnings by the end of the week. These companies include tech giants Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Twitter and e-commerce behemoth Amazon. They are also among the companies expected to beat Wall Street earnings forecasts, according to estimates from Estimize.

 1:38  PM ET Mon, 23 Oct 2017 |  01:32 
 All of these companies, except for Amazon, has a history of topping Wall Street's estimates, too.

 Dow member Microsoft, scheduled to report Thursday after the bell, will report earnings of 78 cents a share, five cents higher than the Street's consensus estimate, according to Estimize. The tech giant also has a history of topping Street expectations 75 percent of the time, according to Estimize.
KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brent Bracelin said he expects Microsoft to post strong quarterly results ""led by the continuation of robust Azure and Office 365 adoption trends.""
""The commercial cloud annualized run-rate is on pace to exceed the $20B goal set back in 2015, either this quarter or next, on 45% y/y growth,"" Bracelin said in a note Sunday. 
Bracelin has an overweight rating and an $82 price target on Microsoft. The stock traded near $79 on Monday and is up about 28 percent this year.
Amazon is also expected to top Wall Street expectations, but one word of caution: The company's earnings beat estimates just 46 percent of the time, according to Estimize. The e-commerce giant will report earnings per share of 12 cents, while Wall Street expects a loss of 2 cents a share, according to Estimize.
Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson, expects the company to post a strong beat as sales from Amazon Web Services grow.
""Historically, the performance of AWS has often had the most impact on its share price, because it is generating the fastest sales growth of its three operating segments (North America, International, and AWS) and the highest margin of the three,"" Forte said in a note to clients Thursday, adding he expects AWS revenue to grow 41.5 percent year over year.
Forte has a buy rating and a $997 price target on the stock. Amazon shares traded near $971 on Monday and are up nearly 30 percent in 2017. Amazon is scheduled to report Thursday after the bell.
Google parent Alphabet and Twitter will also beat the Street, according to Estimize. Both stocks are up 25.2 percent and 7.6 percent this year respectively. Twitter will report Thursday before the open, and Alphabet will report after the close Thursday.

 Amazon received 238 proposals for HQ2   
 1:17  PM ET Mon, 23 Oct 2017 |  00:56 
 Amazon said on Monday that it received 238 proposals from ""cities and regions in 54 states, provinces, districts and territories around North America"" who want to host the company's second headquarters.
 Bids for the new headquarters were due to Amazon on Thursday, Oct. 19. Cities big and small, from Newark, NJ to Boston, MA are trying to woo Amazon and the more than $5 billion it plans to spend on its second headquarters.
One Georgia town's mayor even said he would rename the town Amazon if the company agreed to build there.
 Amazon had very specific requirements for cities that were interested in placing a bid. The company wanted a city with an established mass transit system, easy access to international airports, universities and a population of at least 1 million people.
Amazon is expected to reveal the home of its new headquarters in 2018.

 From this concrete warehouse perched on the edge of a potentially vast new market for online shopping, the Alibaba Group of China hopes to beat Amazon one head of lettuce at a time.
Under the glare of fluorescent lights, green-vested workers carefully wrap fruit, cheese and other perishables for delivery by vans to a growing group of Singaporeans who prefer to do their shopping online. On a nearby wall, printouts show the sorts of defects that customers have complained about in the past: overripe avocados, smelly spinach, rotten honeydews.
“It’s getting better and better,” said Vikram Rupani, president of RedMart, an online grocery company based in Singapore that is part of Alibaba’s push into the region, “but it’s a continuous process that never ends.”
 Alibaba and Amazon already dominate the business of selling stuff online in their home markets. Increasingly, they are competing against each other on neutral ground.
Both are spending billions of dollars on Asia — particularly Southeast Asia and India — as they look for a place that could repeat China’s explosive transformation into the world’s biggest online shopping market.
Amazon has committed $5 billion to India, where it lures customers to sign up for its Prime service, which includes Western movies and television shows, for a small fraction of the $99 annual membership price in the United States. Alibaba has invested roughly $500 million for stakes in both Paytm — India’s largest mobile payments platform — and its e-commerce affiliate, Paytm Mall.
Alibaba’s bigger bet is in Southeast Asia. It has spent more than $2 billion to take control of Lazada, a five-year-old online shopping company based in Singapore and doing business in six countries. Last year, Lazada bought RedMart, the online retail grocery.
The promise is there, as the region’s young middle class grows and goes online. Southeast Asia’s e-commerce sales could total $88 billion by 2025, according to projections from Google and Temasek Holdings, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund. Volume was less than one-tenth that in 2015.
Over about the same period, India’s market could increase six times to a similar amount, Bain & Company, a consulting firm, projects.
Alibaba and Amazon are seeking consumers like Janice Lee Fang, a Singaporean who decided she needed to buy a robot to amuse a 6-year-old daughter home sick from school. Through Amazon’s Prime Now service, introduced in Singapore in July, she bought a Sphero SPRK Plus — a clear plastic ball that can skitter across the floor with a tap of a smartphone — that arrived in less than a day.
“I was thrilled,” said Ms. Fang, who said she also uses Alibaba’s services. “I had time to unbox it and teach her how to use it. It’s a last-minute shopping savior.”
But Southeast Asia is no China. A diffuse area of 600 million people, the region is divided by politics, language and culture. Some places are modern, like Singapore. Other places lack the roads and other infrastructure to get people what they need.
“It’s a mix of urban, semi-urban and rural areas, separated by large distances and — in the Philippines and Indonesia — by water,” said Mike Booker, a partner at the Southeast Asian arm of Bain. “Cash on delivery is still prevalent, and other local players are in the fray.”
The challenges have forced Lazada, Alibaba’s biggest Southeast Asian operation, to get creative.
In Vietnam, local post offices take customer returns and give cash refunds. In Malaysia, customers can collect merchandise from lockers at 7-Eleven stores. And in the Philippines, Lazada uses gas stations as places where merchants can drop off their goods for delivery personnel to pick up.
“We’re in the super, super, super early days,” said Inanc Balci, who oversees Lazada operations in the Philippines.
Alibaba’s international arm has seen its latest quarterly sales more than double in a year, in part from Lazada’s contribution. Still, Lazada and its RedMart subsidiary remain a tiny, and unprofitable, part of Alibaba’s empire. Max Bittner, Lazada’s chief executive, said its Chinese parent has been willing to spend money to build its delivery capabilities and draw more customers.
“E-commerce is an economy of scale game,” Mr. Bittner said. “I don’t feel constrained in any way. I can go after this opportunity with the amount of firepower I need.”
Amazon so far counts Singapore as its only Southeast Asian market, though industry experts widely expect it will expand into other countries. An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment.

Until recently, direct competition between Alibaba and Amazon has been rare. Amazon has a modest presence in China. Alibaba sells goods in the United States through its AliExpress platform but has backed away from further expansion efforts.
Southeast Asia could offer a test of their vastly different business models on neutral turf.
Amazon owns more of the inventory it sells. By contrast, most of Lazada’s sales come from outside vendors who use its platform as a digital middleman to reach customers. That approach, which keeps costs low, is similar to what Alibaba does in China. But in China, the company’s Taobao platform has been accused of offering counterfeit goods. Alibaba says it is working to fight fakes.
Alibaba has a long lead over Amazon and is building up its infrastructure across Southeast Asia. In Indonesia, for example, it took a minority stake in August in another online marketplace, Tokopedia. Experts say Amazon could fight back by offering online Western movies and television programs as it does in the United States, which could increase its appeal with younger customers.
Amazon stumbled in Singapore initially when the service proved too popular, forcing it to turn away customers. But since then the two companies have amped up their efforts to deliver more quickly to a growing group of customers.
At the RedMart warehouse on a recent visit, workers packed cartons — sometimes nine at a time — from bins holding piles of cereal boxes and canned fruits and vegetables. For those who offer ways to improve the process, merit awards include movie tickets, vouchers and cash of up to $1,000.
Competing in the market is likely to be expensive, thanks to customer price cuts and rebates in addition to expansion costs.
“It’s fabulous,” said Uma Parameswar, a Singaporean who works in fine arts management. Over two and a half years of using RedMart, she said, only once did she receive fruit that was less than fresh.
The enticements make her even more inclined to shop online. She says RedMart gives her a 5 percent discount on grocery bills plus discounts on using Uber’s ride-hailing and other services.
“It’s saved me probably $200 in the last three or four months,” she said. “It’s a fair bit.”

Handmade at Amazon
 Amazon escalated the war of artisans on Monday, announcing the launch of a gift shop for its Amazon Handmade program and sparking fear into Etsy investors as it continues its turnaround efforts.
 News of the new shop sent shares of Etsy, which has a market capitalization of $1.9 billion, down more than 3 percent in midday trading.
Etsy, which has been under pressure from activist investors, has been seeking to improve profitability and revive its waning sales. 
 Amazon Handmade , launched in 2015, sells goods like like jewelry, stationary and party supplies in 30 countries. More recently, the microsite has expanded into clothing, shoes and pet supplies. 
The newly announced gift shop — which sells for occasions like weddings and Halloween — caters to celebratory events in which shoppers tend to buy homemade gifts.
These are also the festive buyers Etsy has has sought to catch. 
""Etsy shines specifically in three types of purchase occasions: celebrations, gifting and style,"" said CEO Josh Silverman in its second-quarter earnings call.
""If you think about it, these types of occasions happen regularly throughout the year. These occasions drive purchases across six primary categories, clothing and accessories, home and living, jewelry, craft supplies, art and collectibles, and paper and party supplies.""
Etsy has struggled since its 2015 IPO as sales slowed and new channels — like Amazon and Instagram — created alternative platforms for the independent sellers Etsy caters to. The company has also had to pour more money into marketing, after years of being able to rely on word-of-mouth.
Earlier this year, activist hedge fund Black and White Capital, which revealed a roughly 2 percent stake in Etsy, urged the company to explore a potential sale. Investment firms TPG Group Holding Advisors and Dragoneer Investment Group also jointly reported a stake, though have since reduced it. 
Under this pressure, the company announced a new CEO and two waves of job cuts that led to total reduction in staff of roughly 22 percent.
For Amazon, the bulking up of its artisan business is representative of its broader push to focus on the ""softer side"" of retail. The Seattle-based giant has for years established its dominance by focusing on data and efficiency. As it looks to further expand into retail and now crafts, it is seeking to prove it can also excel with more personal items.
""Every item on Amazon Handmade has a story behind it — and after hearing from customers and artisans, we are thrilled to make gift shopping an experience they will look forward to,"" said  Katie Harnetiaux, a spokeswoman for Amazon Handmade.

Jeff Bezos
 Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is the face of his business empire that now spans everything from e-commerce and cloud computing to hardware devices and even grocery stores. 
 But behind the wide-ranging company is a team of 10 top executives, who report directly to Bezos himself, based on a list compiled by CNBC. While most of them are company veterans, some come from the outside world, like Jay Carney, the former press secretary of President Barack Obama.
What's perhaps more surprising is that, despite Amazon's diverse mix of products and services, Bezos' direct reports are almost exclusively white men. Besides HR boss Beth Galetti, there's zero female or people of color. (Amazon declined to comment.)
 The New York Times reported on Friday that Amazon's lack of diversity at the top ranks may have contributed to former Amazon Studios chief Roy Price's sexual harassment scandal.
Here's a closer look at the 10 most important people at Amazon who directly report to Bezos:
 Jeff Wilke, CEO of Worldwide Consumer: Wilke is the second most powerful person at Amazon. He runs everything on the retail side, including the marketplace, Prime business, and the newly acquired Whole Foods. The 18-year Amazon veteran was promoted to CEO last year. Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services: Jassy has been at the company since 1997. He's one of Bezos' most trusted lieutenants and now runs Amazon's all-important cloud computing business. He was promoted to the CEO of AWS last year. Jeff Blackburn, Sr. VP, Business and Corporate Development: Blackburn is in charge of Amazon's content business, including Prime Video, Music, and Amazon Studios. He also runs Amazon's growing advertising business and oversees the company's M&A and investment arms. A former college football player, Blackburn joined Amazon in 1998. Dave Limp, SVP, Amazon Devices, Digital Management: Limp is one of the newest members to join Bezos' inner circle, reflecting the hardware business' growing importance at the company. He is in charge of all hardware devices as well as the Alexa voice team. The secretive Lab126 team also reports to him. Diego Piacentini, SVP, International Retail: Piacentini is another long-time Amazon executive on this list. A former Apple executive, Piacentini was responsible for all international retail operations after joining Amazon in 2000. He's currently on a two-year leave to help the Italian government. Brian Olsavsky, SVP & CFO Financial Administration: Olsavsky runs Amazon's finance teams and takes the company's earnings call every quarter. He joined in 2002 and was promoted to CFO in 2015. David Zapolsky, SVP & General Counsel, Legal: Zapolsky takes care of Amazon's legal, policy, compliance, and regulatory affairs. He joined the company in 1999 and became the general counsel in 2014. Beth Galetti, SVP, Human Resources, HR Administration: Galetti became Amazon's HR chief in 2016, just three years after joining the company. Prior to Amazon, she spent over 8 years at FedEx. Jay Carney, Corporate Affairs, Global Corporate Affairs: Best known for his role as the White House press secretary for President Barack Obama, Carney joined Amazon in 2015. He runs all public relations and public policy parts of the business. Jeff Helbling, VP Technical Advisor to CEO: Helbling was named the Technical Advisor to CEO, also known as Bezos's ""shadow,"" earlier this year. In this role, Helbling gets to join Bezos everywhere he goes, including business meetings, to learn about all aspects of the company. Before, he was in charge of the Kindle's content business.

 O'Reilly Automotive: ""I think you should sell. I don't like the fact that Amazon really does want to be in that business. This is no longer just phantom. They want to be in it.""
MGM Resorts International: ""I do think that there could be some lawsuits here. I do prefer, right now, to buy Wynn [Resorts]. I just want things to be a little bit more clear. I do prefer the MGM REIT, because of the 5 percent yield, to the MGM common [stock].""
 Pilgrims Pride Corporation: ""You know what? I'm a huge believer in protein, and I think protein is a winner here. And that's one of the reasons why I think that Tyson's been good. I think, on any discount, I like Pilgrims Pride.""
Sterling Construction Company Inc.: ""Sterling's good. You know, I have to tell you, I think that Sterling is a very good situation. The one that I have repeatedly liked more is Martin Marietta Materials, but you know what? I think your Sterling will do well.""

 Amazon will soon let you order from restaurants using the Amazon app on your phone   
 4:43  PM ET Mon, 30 Oct 2017 |  01:59 
 Starting in November Amazon customers in select states will be able to order take-out from certain local restaurants directly through the Amazon app. 
 Users will be able to browse participating restaurants, place their order and checkout with stored payment information all through the app, without any additional accounts or logins needed. 
The expansion of Amazon Pay integrates Clover point-of-sale systems, sending orders directly to restaurants in select states in the Northeast U.S.. 
 ""Clover has the technology and scale we needed to bring this vision to life,"" Amazon said in a statement. ""We've had an ongoing partnership with Clover — we used them to great success with our Kindle pop-up stores — and it was only natural to expand on that.""
The expansion of Amazon Pay is the e-commerce giant's latest push for brick-and-mortar presence. The company is also expanding its locker program and just set up shop in select Kohl's locations last week. 
The company said that more than 33 million customers used Amazon Pay in 2016, nearly doubling Amazon Pay volume from the prior year. The service allows in-app payments for travel, digital goods, insurance, entertainment, and charitable donations. 
The restaurant take-out service is already available for orders from T.G.I. Fridays as of July and will expand to include restaurants in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Washington D.C. — and, of course, the Seattle area.

 Amazon shares have nearly doubled the market's gain so far this year. But even after the big runup, Wall Street analysts are recommending that investors buy them before this week's earnings report.
 Deutsche Bank on Tuesday reiterated its buy rating for Amazon shares, predicting solid results from its e-commerce business.
""Heading into Amazon's 3Q results, we expect strong top-line growth to continue, especially in retail where Amazon has been aggressively investing in fulfillment facilities and content to improve the overall value to consumers / Prime members,"" analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note to clients.
 ""We remain bullish on the name as a core long-term holding with the largest TAM [total addressable market] of any company we cover and strong long term barriers.""
Walmsley raised his price target to $1,192, which is 23 percent higher than Monday's closing price. His old price target was $1,175.
The analyst said the company has significantly increased its fulfillment and operational capabilities in international markets such as India, Singapore, Brazil and Europe. He is also optimistic about Amazon's ability to take advantage of its recent Whole Foods Market acquisition.
In the near term, Amazon should be able to use the Whole Foods stores as a way to draw its Prime subscribers to order food online, he said.
Longer term, he said, ""we expect Amazon to leverage the Whole Foods Market brand and supply chain to source high-quality food and build demand for it, but ultimately leverage Amazon's expertise to drive efficiency in the logistics efforts, fulfilling orders outside of the Whole Foods Market store footprint.""
JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth reaffirmed his overweight rating for Amazon shares, predicting strong growth trends for its Whole Foods business.
""Going forward we expect Whole Foods Market revenue to accelerate,"" he wrote Tuesday. ""We believe Amazon is well positioned as the market leader in eCommerce … We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall eCommerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party vs. third-party inventory and its Prime offering both serve as major advantages.""
Anmuth raised his price target for the company to $1,180 from $1,175.
Amazon's stock is up 29 percent this year through Monday compared with the S&P 500's 15 percent gain. Its shares rose 1 percent shortly after Tuesday's market open.
The company will report third-quarter results on Thursday, according to its website.

 David Einhorn: Value investing may be dead   
 3:04  PM ET Tue, 24 Oct 2017 |  01:02 
 Hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who's become a billionaire by effectively identifying undervalued and overvalued stocks, is struggling right now and questioning whether the classic investing principles that made him will ever work again.
 ""The market remains very challenging for value investing strategies, as growth stocks have continued to outperform value stocks. The persistence of this dynamic leads to questions regarding whether value investing is a viable strategy,"" Einhorn wrote in an investor letter Tuesday obtained by CNBC.
The hedge fund manager specifically cited his bets against soaring Tesla and Amazon shares.
 ""Given the performance of certain stocks, we wonder if the market has adopted an alternative paradigm for calculating equity value,"" he wrote. ""What if equity value has nothing to do with current or future profits and instead is derived from a company's ability to be disruptive, to provide social change, or to advance new beneficial technologies, even when doing so results in current and future economic loss?""
Tesla and Amazon shares are up 58 percent and 29 percent this year, respectively, compared with the S&P 500's 15 percent return through Monday.
""Our view is that just because Amazon can disrupt somebody else's profit stream, it doesn't mean that Amazon earns that profit stream. For the moment, the market doesn't agree,"" he wrote.
Einhorn was also not satisfied with the modest decline in Tesla's stock after the company's recent financial results.
""Tesla had an awful quarter both in its current results and future prospects. In response, its shares fell almost 6%,"" he wrote. ""We believe it deserved much worse.""
The investor doesn't know when value investing will work again.
 ""The knee-jerk instinct is to respond that when a proven strategy is so exceedingly out of favor that its viability is questioned, the cycle must be about to turn around. Unfortunately, we lack such clarity. After years of running into the wind, we are left with no sense stronger than, 'it will turn when it turns.'"" 
Einhorn's Greenlight Capital returned 6.2 percent in the third quarter, bringing its performance for 2017 through September to 3.3 percent, according to the investor letter. In comparison the S&P 500 rose 14.2 percent in the same year-to-date time period, according to the investor letter.
Greenlight, Amazon and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

 Leon Cooperman: My largest position is Google   
 3:19  PM ET Tue, 24 Oct 2017 |  02:15 
 Leon Cooperman, chairman and CEO of Omega Advisors, shared his top stock ideas Tuesday on CNBC's ""Halftime Report."" 
 ""I'm finding a lot of stocks that are attractively priced,"" said the hedge fund manager. ""My largest position is Google [meaning Alphabet shares, the company that owns Google].""
Cooperman said Alphabet trades at 19 times next year's earnings and is able to grow its sales at 20 percent per year. He likes how it has a ""fortress balance sheet."" 
 He revealed he owns other growth technology stocks such as Facebook and Amazon. 
""Amazon is changing the whole landscape of retailing,"" Cooperman said.
The investor is bullish on financial stocks as he predicts rates will rise, boosting the sector's earnings prospects.
""We own some Wells Fargo. We own some Citi,"" he said. ""Interest rates are below where they ought to be. I expect interest rates to rise.""
Cooperman also forecasts oil prices will increase to $60 per barrel.
""We own Hess. We own Parsley Energy ... WPX Energy,"" he said. ""The world economy is not going to grow 3 percent to 3.5 percent without the demand for energy growing.""
Cooperman founded Omega Advisors in 1991. The firm has approximately $3.7 billion in assets under management, according to its website.
His firm agreed in May to a $4.9 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission after allegations of insider trading. As part of the settlement, Omega Advisors admitted to no wrongdoing.

 Amazon is bulking up its service for business supplies with free two-day shipping on select items.
 On Tuesday, the company launched a Prime membership service for Amazon Business, with subscriptions starting at $499 a year for 10 users and going up to $10,099 for more than 100 users.
Amazon Business sells everything from industrial supplies like screws and pumps to lab and medical equipment. Industrial suppliers are feeling the pain, with shares of W.W. Grainger dropping 4.7 percent on Tuesday, and Fastenal falling 3.9 percent.
 Amazon said ""millions"" of items are eligible for the new prime service. In July, two years after its launch, Amazon Business announced that it surpassed 1 million customers. The marketplace hit $1 billion in sales in its first year.
Small merchants turn to Amazon Business to avoid complicated, long-term contracts with big suppliers. In a report last year, RBC Capital estimated that business supplies are a $5 trillion market, ""and Amazon's offering is unique and leverages Amazon's core competencies.""

 A new subscription offering from Amazon could be a major threat to Lake Forest, Illinois-based industrial supplier W.W. Grainger. 
 Shares of GWW fell more than 3 percent to $202.05 Tuesday afternoon after Amazon Business announced an upgrade to their shipping services for business customers. The new Business Prime Shipping service offers free two-day shipping to multi-user business accounts in Germany and the United States, a feature Amazon says will simplify procurement. 
Business Prime Shipping directly competes with at least two Grainger operations, including the Japanese e-commerce unit MonotaRO Co and the British distributor Cromwell. Taken together, the two companies account for 11 percent of Grainger's total sales, according to a research note from RBC Capital Markets. 
 ""Given parent Amazon's deep pockets and apparent margin insensitivity, we continue to believe that Grainger will be drawn into further price competition, putting more pressure on its gross margin,"" the analysts wrote. ""We reiterate our high-conviction Underperform rating on GWW shares.""
Grainger shares have been struggling this year. The company is down more than 12 percent year to date, despite a boost earlier this month when the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings. 
Joseph Micucci, a representative for Grainger, issued the following statement to CNBC: 
 The majority of Grainger's U.S. customers do not pay freight, as freight costs are embedded in our contracts. Grainger also offers freight advantaged programs, such as Red Pass Plus, which include free freight with a flat annual fee for non-contract customers. Zoro customers do not pay freight on orders above $50. Grainger has a history of providing competitive freight options for next day service.

Chuck Robbins, CEO of Cisco
 When Chuck Robbins was promoted to CEO of Cisco in 2015, the company's technology was in danger of losing relevance.
 When Google named Diane Greene as head of its cloud division that same year, her unit was desperate to close the gap with Amazon Web Services.
Two years later, Robbins and Greene are teaming up to develop and sell cloud technology and services in a whole new way and to take on AWS. 
 On Wednesday, Cisco and Google announced a partnership that will combine Google's expertise in building massive data centers and open source software with Cisco's global salesforce, customer support and security.

Diane Greene, Google
 Cloud infrastructure, the technology that allows businesses to offload their computing and storage needs and access their data from anywhere, has become a huge and fast growing market — and Amazon dominates it. The company's AWS business got started in 2006 and is now generating over $4 billion in sales a quarter. 
 AWS controls 34 percent of the market, according to Synergy Research Group. Google is a distant fourth with around 5 percent of the market, behind AWS, Microsoft, and IBM.
But the cloud is maturing, creating new openings for competitors.
In particular, big companies with thousands of employees and legacy servers aren't dumping all of their data into AWS. Instead, they often do new projects in the cloud and let developers test and build apps there, while leaving core data in their own data centers.
This is particularly true for complicated and heavily regulated businesses like hospitals and banks — exactly the kinds of businesses an enterprise upstart like Google wants to reach. 
 Coming in 2018
 ""This whole cloud phenomenon is gaining steam pretty rapidly, and it's really become a strategic imperative for people,"" Greene told CNBC.
""But it just can't happen that fast. It's a lot to take all your on-premise data centers to the cloud and not everything will necessarily move.""
As part of the agreement, Google and Cisco are co-developing a hybrid offering that will bring some of Google's tools for working with cloud services to enterprises that aren't ready to go all-in on the cloud. Cisco will provide security and support as well as computer networking.
A winning cloud strategy is also critical for Cisco. There's not much growth left in selling hardware like routers and switches, which have generated the bulk of Cisco's revenue, and its software products for communications and collaboration operate in highly competitive markets. 
But Cisco has relationships with the largest enterprises and governments around the world. Because those customers demand modern tools for application development and for running machine learning workloads, Cisco's ability to offer Google's services may be a way to keep them from fleeing.

 Cisco CEO: We need to focus on uniting the country

 ""We've listened to our customers,"" Robbins told CNBC. ""They're looking for cloud speed and scale and agility, but they want the flexibility of running applications in private data centers as well as in public clouds.""
The Google-Cisco offering will be available for early customers in the first half of 2018 and will hit the broader market in the second half of the year.
Greene highlighted Kubernetes and Istio as two open-source products that will have particular resonance with Cisco customers. Kubernetes was developed by Google, and allows developers to build and deploy apps in digital containers. Istio was created by Google, IBM and ride-hailing start-up Lyft and is used for managing microservices, or small software programs that are stitched together to perform a variety of functions. Both technologies help programmers build software more quickly and flexibly, and make it more reliable and less likely to crash.
Google and Cisco aren't divulging how the revenue split will work. And Robbins said there's nothing in the deal that precludes Cisco from forging similar partnerships with other cloud providers, should the opportunity arise. 
With AWS still growing at almost 40 percent a year, Google is eager to show the market where it has advantages over its rivals.
""Customers are excited about this when we explain it to them,"" Greene said. ""It lets them see where we're going and how we're going to do it.""

 Amazon Key aims to deliver inside the door   
 10:23  AM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 |  01:14 
 Amazon launched a smart security camera on Wednesday that works with its voice assistant Alexa, which will allow deliveries to your home even when you're out. 
 The service is called Amazon Key and the indoor security camera has been named the Amazon Cloud Cam. Amazon however is not making a lock, which will instead be supplied by several manufacturers such as Yale and Kwikset.
Amazon Key enables in-home delivery and access for guests and service appointments. It will be available from November 8 in 37 cities across the U.S. and will be rolling out to more locations over time. Delivery via this method is available at no extra cost for Prime members. 
 Users can also download the Amazon Key app, which will enable them to track a delivery and even watch the delivery as it happens or review the video once the delivery is complete. Each time a delivery driver requests access to a customer's home, Amazon verifies the correct driver is at the right address at the right time. 
The Amazon Cloud Cam then starts recording and the door is unlocked. 
Prime members can preorder the Cloud Cam and a compatible lock starting from $249.99. The Cloud Cam alone starts at $119.99 and will begin shipping on November 8.
The camera records in full high definition, has night vision and two-way audio capabilities. Users can view footage from the camera via the Amazon Cloud Cam App. It also works with Amazon's voice assistant Alexa on the Echo Show, Echo Spot, Fire TV and Fire Tablets. Users can ask Alexa to show the camera footage on the screens of these devices. 
Amazon is also offering subscriptions that will give access to more storage and a feature which will flag up human movement, rather than general motion like a pet walking. The basic subscription starts at $6.99 per month or $69 for the year and gives users access to the last 7 days of video for up to 3 cameras. The highest tier is a $19.99 per month or $199 per year subscription offering support for 10 cameras and video from the last 30 days. 
With the camera's built-in microphone, users can remotely talk to family members or even a pet. 
Amazon's latest hardware offerings continue its smart home strategy. Its Echo speaker products are seen as the hub to control many of the devices. 
Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect that Amazon is not manufacturing the locks but is using third parties.

 Amazon Key aims to deliver inside the door   
 10:23  AM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 |  01:14 
 Amazon's new Amazon Key service lets delivery people enter your home to drop off a package.
 I'm not sure I'm ready for that, as compelling as it sounds.
Let me play devil's advocate for a moment.
 I've been perfectly willing to let Amazon inside my home (and life) in other — more digital — ways. I have an Amazon Echo that allows me to interact with Amazon's services, even ordering products by voice. And I have the Amazon Fire TV, which allows me to stream all sorts of content provided by Amazon.
I just don't think I want a random human walking inside my house when I'm not there.
Amazon Key, which launches Nov. 8, uses a compatible smart lock in tandem with a new Amazon camera. When a delivery is about to arrive, Amazon will send a notification to your phone and then the company will ""authorize the delivery and unlock your door,"" remotely. Thanks to the camera, you'll be able to see the delivery live or watch directly from your phone, and you'll be notified when the door is relocked, Amazon said.
I see the appeal here: It's better to have a package dropped inside your home instead of outside, where it might be rained on, left in the snow, or stolen.
But we're opening a whole can of worms by allowing a human inside our homes when we aren't there: What if he slips and falls? What if Amazon says the package was delivered but it wasn't? What if the dog gets out? What if the delivery person decides to stick around and help themselves to a few items in your home? (I'm not saying delivery people are more likely to do this than anyone else, but it seems bound to happen at some point.) What if someone can hack their way in, pretending to be a delivery person?
Amazon can't be the only company to have thought about trying to get packages safely inside a house, though it's the first with the technology to do so. FedEx, UPS, DHL and other shipping companies must have thought getting inside the home would be the best way to guarantee a delivery. We could, after all, have had some sort of agreement in place to let the FedEx guy use the key under the doormat, but we never got that far. My home is a personal space, and I'm reluctant to give people the key to get inside when I'm not there. 
Still, there's something special about Amazon that makes the company seem more harmless than others. Perhaps it's that we love the Prime service, Alexa's helpfulness and the broad array of content it provides us. While I might not be ready to let Amazon inside my home, it's possible the convenience of such a service will force me to let my guard down eventually. Amazon's good at that.

 Goldman warns Amazon holders, predicts guidance may miss Wall Street expectations   
 1:26  PM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 |  00:49 
 Amazon will most likely disappoint Wall Street with its fourth-quarter forecast, analysts at Goldman Sachs said.
 ""Investor focus remains on operating income with the view that guidance is likely to fall below sell-side consensus of $1.5bn,"" Heath Terry, an analyst at Goldman, said in a note Wednesday.
""We expect the company to guide total revenue +26-34% yoy with $0mn to $1.0bn in GAAP operating profits, as guidance factors in the Whole Foods acquisition, [Amazon Web Services] growth accelerates modestly on an 800bps easier comp, and both revenue and expenses reflect the investments in new fulfillment centers and AWS regions,"" Terry said.
 The e-commerce giant is set to report on Thursday its third-quarter results and its expectations for the final quarter of the year.
Amazon shares have handily outperformed the broader market in 2017. The company's stock is up 30.1 percent for the year, while the S&P 500 has risen nearly 15 percent.
 It's unclear what the lowered guidance would mean for the stock. Amazon gave income guidance the last two earnings reports that were short of the consensus Wall Street estimate, but the stock kept climbing anyway.
Despite the expected lower guidance, Terry said investors are ""underestimating the potential for organic growth reacceleration as the ~70% growth in infrastructure spend (CapEx and Capital Leases) over the TTM begins to deliver returns and AWS comps ease.""
Terry has a 12-month price target of $1,275 on Amazon — implying a 30 percent upside — and a buy rating.

 Akamai Technologies CEO on improving cloud security   
 7:58  PM ET Wed, 25 Oct 2017 |  03:11 
 Akamai CEO and co-founder Tom Leighton said the Equifax breach helped fuel the growth of the cloud service provider's own security product, as the company makes a big push into cybersecurity.
 ""Our security business is growing at a very rapid clip,"" Leighton said in an interview on CNBC's Squawk Alley.
But one thing that prompted Akamai — a company whose main business has been managing web traffic at busy sites — to shift much of its focus to the cloud security business was increasing pressure from other giants in cloud computing, like Apple and Amazon. Increasingly these tech giants are finding in-house solutions for traffic management, he said.
 The security portfolio of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Akamai is experiencing rapid growth, he said. It grew 27 percent, year-over-year, to $121 million in revenue, making it the fastest growing portion of the company, according to Thomson Reuters.
Leighton attributes this growth, in part, to increasing cybersecurity threats.
""I think we have a long way to go in terms of security, you can look at the headlines to see all the damage they're causing,"" Leighton said.
As Equifax's July breach proved, it only took about two months of flawed security to exposed the personal and financial information of nearly 143 million Americans.
Akamai's product, Kona Site Defender, is designed to prevent exactly the types of threat that brought down Equifax. Leighton said he felt Kona could have ""easily stopped"" that type of breach.
And Leighton isn't concerned with revenue from security solutions drying up.
""When it comes to areas like security, there is no choice, they have to defend themselves. The attack landscape is evolving very rapidly,"" Leighton said.
Akamai is ramping up to accommodate increasing security threats, researching new measures, like nano technology, that don't focus solely on perimeter defense.

 Amazon shares soar after massive earnings beat   
 5:32  PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 |  00:30 
 Amazon Web Services, the cloud-computing business, grew 42 percent in the third quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations. 
 In its earnings report on Thursday after the market's close, Amazon reported AWS revenue of $4.58 billion, topping the $4.5 billion average analyst estimate, according to FactSet. 
AWS remains the profit engine for Amazon, which has always operated on thin e-commerce margins. While AWS accounted for 10 percent of Amazon's total revenue in the quarter, the unit generated operating income of $1.17 billion, while the company as a whole had operating profit of just $347 million. 
 AWS revenue growth was flat compared to the prior quarter, following eight straight quarters of slowing expansion. 
""The business model at this scale is transitioning from hypergrowth to high growth alongside an increasing number"" of competitors, analysts from KeyBanc wrote in a report on Tuesday. Enterprises are increasingly willing to use more than one cloud, they wrote.
But AWS still leads the market for cloud infrastructure, which companies can use to run their applications without worrying about maintaining the underlying data center hardware. 
AWS owned 30 percent of the market in the second quarter, more than double the market share of its closest competitor, Microsoft Azure, which had 14 percent, Matthew Ball, an analyst at Canalys,told CNBC last month.
""AWS seems to have settled into a sustainable competitive situation relative to Microsoft and Google,"" analysts at Canaccord Genuity wrote in a note on Oct. 19. ""We expect growth to remain high for the foreseeable future.""
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that AWS surpassed $4 billion in sales for the first time. It recorded $4.1 billion in revenue in the second quarter.

Jeff Bezos, chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc.
 Wall Street expects Amazon to report another quarter with plenty of growth but little profit, as the e-commerce giant ramps up its investment in areas like warehouses, content, and international markets.
 Amazon is expected to post third-quarter earnings of 3 cents a share after the bell Thursday, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, down from 52 cents a year ago. Revenue is projected to increase 27 percent to $41.6 billion from $32.7 billion. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs analysts expect operating expenses at Amazon to jump 40 percent to $15.3 billion.
Here are the topics that will likely be of greatest interest to investors on the earnings call:
 Whole Foods impact: After the Whole Foods deal closed in late August, Amazon cut prices on select items in the stores. Investors will want to to know what's next. Cowen & Co. estimates up to $1.5 billion in additional revenue from the acquisition in the quarter. AWS growth: Growth has slowed in recent quarters and Amazon's continued to slash prices, but analysts still expect a 41 percent increase in sales. GBH Insights sees AWS's revenue growth accelerating in the fourth quarter. Emerging revenue opportunities: Amazon has launched a number of new Echo devices and continues to see strong demand from its advertising business. There have also been reports about new delivery services. ""We are more bullish than ever on some of the emerging businesses around advertising, hardware and logistics,"" Macquarie Research wrote in a note. HQ2 and Prime Day: Investors will likely ask about the reason for building a new headquarters and for additional details on July's Prime Day.

People walk past the signature glass spheres under construction at the Amazon corporate headquarters on June 16, 2017 in Seattle.
 Let me start off by saying I have no non-public information about Amazon's search for a second headquarters, aka HQ2. And I have no idea how Amazon's senior leaders will score proposals and make a decision.
 But I have a couple of observations I'd like to make based on how Amazonians think.
Last week's big news on the HQ2 front was how Newark was offering $7 billion in incentives if Amazon chose it for HQ2. The $7 billion was composed of $5 billion over 10 years from the state of New Jersey and $2 billion over 20 years from the city. Nice.
 But cities that think Amazon will make its decision based on short-term incentives — and 10 years is short-term for Amazon — are sadly mistaken. Incentives are going to be a tie-breaker, not the primary driver of a decision.
Amazon thinks long-term, so senior leadership is going to be thinking about picking a location that they believe will be the right one for 2030, 2040 and 2050. Incentives that mostly run out in the 2020s won't mean much if it means having 50,000 people in the wrong place in 2035. So they will narrow things down based on other criteria, get to a few finalists, then start weighing the value of the incentives. 
 The Uber test
 On Facebook, a friend who grew up in Memphis suggested that city for Amazon HQ2. This was in response to The New York Times' analysis saying HQ2 would go to Denver.
Memphis isn't an obvious choice, and I don't know how it lines up with the official criteria. So how can one quickly weigh if Memphis, or any other location, would be a good choice for Amazon?
Amazon is a company where it is always ""Day 1"". Among other things, that means it tends to pursue disruptive ideas, such as using drones for deliveries. Amazon would want HQ2 to be in a location that is supportive of a Day 1 company, if not outright still in Day 1 itself. What I needed was a simple test for Day 1 type disruptions, and the last decade presented us with a perfect one: Ride sharing, and more specifically Uber. 
Uber has been disruptive in applying technology to an urban transportation system (taxis) that hasn't changed significantly in almost a century, and has deeply entrenched interests. Moreover, that system had become highly regulated with substantial public bureaucracies and government revenue streams linked to them. So wherever Uber (or Lyft) went, it was going against ""the system"" and friction was to be expected. What you could measure, very quickly thanks to Google and Bing, was just how much friction (or support) Uber ran into with local government.
So I did a search on Memphis and Uber and discovered that in 2013 the city of Memphis had sent its police force to arrest Uber drivers. That seemed like a pretty extreme case of being unfriendly to Day 1 type disruptions, and I pointed that out to my friend.
He pointed out this was 2013 -- four years ago -- so I did a search on Denver and Uber and discovered that in 2013 the Colorado Legislature became the first in the country to explicitly legalize ride-sharing. What Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper said at the time was, ""Colorado is once again in the vanguard in promoting innovation and competition while protecting consumers and public safety."" And when there was some friction in the city of Denver after that, the  Police Chief acted quickly to resolve it.
Which makes more sense to locate the headquarters of a Day 1 company in: A place that sent the police to arrest Uber drivers or one that acted quickly to accept and encourage the disruption?
So let's get back to Newark. There are many reasons I could think of for picking Newark as HQ2. In particular the close proximity to New York City and all its benefits, with much better housing costs. Making the reverse commute from Manhattan to nearby New Jersey cities has even become reasonably common in the last 20 years. The incentives being offered are nice, but again they are a short-term benefit in a long-term play.
So I applied the Uber test to Newark, and it failed miserably.
Newark was still trying to force Uber into their taxi regulatory scheme as recently as 2016, banning them from  Newark Airport and train station in February and planning to enact further regulation in April. Uber was planning to abandon the city when a  last minute deal was reached. Compare what Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said about Uber —""Just because they have a great idea, doesn't mean they have an exemption from rules and regulations that have been in existence for decades,"" — with the earlier quote from Colorado Governor Hickenlooper.
I was particularly caught by the ""rules and regulations that have been in existence for decades"" part. That doesn't read like a Day 1 supportive location to me. It is quite possible that those words will come back to haunt Mayor Baraka when Amazon is evaluating the HQ2 proposals.
The Uber test isn't perfect for a couple of reasons. One is that pretty much any locality that regulates taxis and limousines will try to put some regulatory regime around ride sharing. The other is that Uber itself has valued confrontation with local governments and agencies over reaching an accommodation, and that in some cases has raised the heat significantly. For example, I know of airports where Lyft was able to pick up months before Uber, because they negotiated a deal while Uber was still trying to fight the local airport authority.
So the Uber test isn't black and white, it is varying shades of grey.
But compare the light grey of Denver to the very dark grey of Newark and it, at the very least, gives an indication of which city would be more accommodating to a company where it is always Day 1.

 Drugstore stocks tumble on Amazon report   
 7:25  PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 |  00:55 
 Shares of drugstore companies tumbled midday Thursday on a report that Amazon is getting approval to distribute drugs in multiple states.
 The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that Amazon received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12 states after reviewing public records. These licenses could be used for distributing other items, such as medical supplies, and do not necessarily mean that Amazon is getting into the pharmacy business.Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Rite Aid and CVS Health fell3.2 percent, 6.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, as investors worried Amazon may disrupt the drugstore market.
Express Scripts stock, a pharmacy benefits management company, also fell 3.7 percent.
 CNBC reported on Oct. 6 that Amazon will decide before Thanksgiving whether to move into selling prescription drugs online, according to a source.
An Amazon spokesperson said by email that the company doesn't ""comment on rumors or speculation.""

 Amazon shares soar after massive earnings beat   
 5:32  PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 |  00:30 
 Amazon's third quarter results far exceeded Wall Street expectations Thursday, pushing up its stock by over 7 percent in after hours trading.
 Investors were expecting smaller profits as the third quarter is typically a heavy investment period for Amazon ahead of the holiday season. But strong growth in North American sales and Amazon Web Services offset increased spending in new areas.
The company also offered a positive outlook for the fourth quarter, its largest quarter of the year.
 Here are the most important numbers:
 Revenue: $43.7 billion vs. $42.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters EPS: 52 cents vs. 3 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters AWS revenue: $4.58 billion vs. $4.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters 
Revenue increased 34 percent from last year, in part due to the $1.3 billion in sales from Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired in late-August. North American sales were $25.4 billion, up 35 percent from last year, while international sales grew 29% to $13.7 billion.
AWS remains the the company's growth driver, jumping another 42 percent in sales. Amazon's cloud business is the company's most profitable unit that allows it to keep investing in the core business.
Investors continue to give a pass on Amazon's laser-thin profits. Operating profit dropped in all three major segments, by 40 percent in total to $347 million, as operating expenses grew 45 percent from a year ago. That resulted in an operating margin of just 0.8%, the lowest since September 2014. 
Still, Amazon shares were up by as much as 8 percent in extended hours, and have grown 30 percent year-to-date.
Amazon also broke out physical store sales for the first time, posting $1.3 billion in revenue, which primarily came from Whole Foods.
Amazon said it added 160,000 employees in the last three months (roughly 87,000 from Whole Foods), ahead of the all-important holiday seasons.
Amazon gave fourth quarter guidance in the range of $56.0 billion and $60.5 billion, right in-line with street estimates of $58.9 billion.

Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.
 Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin added $8.6 billion to their combined wealth on Thursday, thanks to better-than-expected earnings reports from two of the world's three most valuable internet companies.
 Bezos picked up an additional $6.24 billion in value, which likely puts him ahead of Microsoft founder Bill Gates to make him the world's richest person. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos was worth $83.5 billion earlier on Thursday, about $4.5 billion behind Gates at $88 billion. 
Gates still owns 1.3 percent of Microsoft. His wealth also increased Thursday afternoon, by about $340 million, after the software maker's earnings topped analysts' estimates.
 Page is $1.2 billion richer and Brin's fortunes increased by $1.15 billion after Alphabet's third-quarter profit blew past expectations. Prior to the results, they were worth $49.3 billion and $48.2 billion, respectively.
Technology leaders are climbing the ranks of the world's wealthiest people this year as their businesses outperform the rest of the market. Six of the top 10 names on the list are founders of U.S. tech companies.
Next up is Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who's ranked fifth on the list at $72.4 billion, according to Bloomberg. His company reports results on Nov. 1.

People shop in the newly opened Amazon Books on May 25, 2017 in New York City.
 Amazon has been making a strong push towards brick and mortar lately, acquiring Whole Foods and opening dozens of bookstores and pop-up stores.
 But almost all the revenue from its push into the physical world is coming from Whole Foods.
Amazon broke out sales from ""physical stores"" for the first time in its third-quarter earnings report on Thursday. The segment generated $1.28 billion in the quarter — roughly the same as the $1.3 billion Whole Foods produced for Amazon in the period.
 That means revenue from its other stores, like the 12 booksellers and 50-plus pop-up stores run by Amazon, is almost non-existent.
During the earnings call, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky acknowledged that most of the physical store sales came from Whole Foods. A physical store, Olsavsky said, is a place ""where customers are physically selecting items in a store, versus perhaps ordering online and picking up somewhere.""
Amazon has yet to spell out a clear strategy behind its retail expansion. In a previous call, Olsavsky said Amazon's bookstores are more than just a place to sell books, but also provide a great channel to showcase the company's hardware devices.
Last month, CNBC reported that Amazon is seeing an uptick in online sales in the regions where it already has a physical outpost.
The company is giving every indication that more physical stores are on the way.
""You will see more expansion from us,"" Olsavsky said during Thursday's call. ""It's still early, so those plans will develop over time.""

 Price for CVS-Aetna depends on other offers that come in: Morningstar health care analyst   
 8:00  PM ET Thu, 26 Oct 2017 |  01:32 
 CVS Health appears willing to pay top dollar for a health insurer in an effort to hold its own against competitors.
 Drugstore operator CVS is in talks to buy health insurer Aetna for a proposed $200 per share or more, sources familiar said. The $66 billion or greater deal would be the largest ever in health insurance history, according to an analysis of Thomson Reuters data. 
The deal comes as the $467 billion e-commerce giant Amazon.com has been quietly exploring ways to expand into the pharmaceutical industry. Jeff Bezos' company has also contributed to the struggles of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like CVS.
 #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(""dw-chart"");$(window).on(""orientationchange"",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});});
 ""They needed to defend the business from encroachment by Amazon,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill told CNBC. ""Amazon's ability to impact the business over the near to mid term is low, but the ability to impact the stock is high.""
CVS would lose the ability to control its own destiny if it didn't do something, Hill added. ""This could be $260 billion in revenue [in 2019].""
The Wall Street Journal first reported that CVS was in talks to buy the health insurer.
CVS has already been trying to establish greater control in its corner of the health care industry. In 2007, the company acquired Caremark pharmacy benefit manager, which has more than 75 million plan members.
Aetna shares closed Thursday 11.5 percent higher at $178.60 a share after The Wall Street Journal posted its report.  CVS shares fell about 3 percent Thursday and were down another 0.4 percent in premarket trading Friday.
""The key here is you're going to control the health-care participants in a much greater way,"" said CFRA senior analyst Joseph Agnese. By acquiring Aetna, CVS could offer customers lower co-pays in the drug stores.
""That will incentivize 23 million people to come to CVS rather than Walgreens,"" Agnese said. He has a hold recommendation on CVS Health. ""I find it very difficult to imagine how Amazon will enter the space without making big acquisitions.""
An Amazon spokeswoman told CNBC in a statement the company has a ""longstanding practice of not commenting on rumors and speculation."" 
CNBC reported in May that Amazon has been recruiting health insurance experts to develop an internal pharmacy benefits manager for Amazon employees. 
However, RBC's Hill expects that, if Amazon were to announce an online pharmacy, it would still take the internet commerce behemoth a decade to get even 10 percent of market share. 
In September, Hill had predicted an ""inflection point"" ahead for CVS should the company transform itself by acquiring a managed care organization like Aetna. Such a move, Hill said at the time, ""could transform itself and the space more broadly.""
Hill told CNBC on Thursday he was optimistic how it appeared that CVS was now pursuing the right strategy. ""A year into this transaction, not only do you have a company with formidable offerings [in health care, but] maybe only United could compete.""

 Amazon is shaking the medical industry — and now Wall Street's digging up clues on exactly what it has planned.
 Jefferies analyst Brian Tanquilut wrote on Friday that he suspects Amazon is growing its professional medical device business, while Wells Fargo pointed out Thursday that Amazon now owns the AmazonRX.com domain. It's all part of the tea-leaf reading as investors try to understand how Amazon could disrupt a huge and historically difficult-to-break-into industry.
CNBC reported in May that each year, Amazon holds an annual meeting to discuss whether it should break into the pharmacy market, and this year, it's been more serious than ever. 
 Now, sources have said that CVS Health is in talks to buy Aetna — a deal that would be an unprecedented mega-merger between a top drugstore chain and insurer. RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill told CNBC that the companies ""needed to defend the business from encroachment by Amazon.""

 Threatened by Amazon? CVS makes $66 billion bid for Aetna   
 12:46  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  05:05 
 The news roiled pharmaceutical stocks, while Amazon shares are at all-time highs.
According to Tanquilut, Amazon's business-to-business medical device web page was posted during the same period the company was granted wholesale distribution licenses in several states. The licensure was first reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
An Amazon spokesperson previously told CNBC by email that the company doesn't ""comment on rumors or speculation.""
While many have speculated these licenses could be used for drugs, Tanquilut said the timing could indicate Amazon is more interested in medical devices. 
""[T]he out-of-state wholesaler license that AMZN filed with the state of Nevada revealed that AMZN did not select 'Controlled Substances' as a type of product that they would be handling,""  Tanquilut wrote in a Friday research note.""While we acknowledge that there are prescription drugs that don't fall under the definition of 'controlled substances', the active decision to choose not to distribute those types of drugs leads us to believe that AMZN will not be using these licenses to distribute any prescription drugs[.]""
On the other hand, Wells Fargo analyst David Maris pointed out that AmazonRX.com redirects to the Amazon home page.
""We find it easy to envision that, if it entered pharmacy, Amazon could offer unique value to some customers, such as the easier ability to manage prescriptions and perhaps discounts, such as free generics to Prime users,"" Maris wrote. Overall, we think that even though Amazon has not stated a goal to be in pharmacy, history has shown it is better to consider Amazon's disruptive potential beforehand rather than afterward.""

 The e-commerce juggernaut added more market value in one day than that of more than 400 individual companies in the S&P 500.
Amazon shares surged more than 13 percent to an all-time high Friday, a day after it reported better-than-expected earnings. The gain represented $61.7 billion of additional value for Amazon shareholders, who now own a company with about $529 billion total market value, according to FactSet.

 Tech stocks are on fire, will Apple and Facebook join the party next?   
 6:56  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  04:44 
 Big tech is getting bigger.
 Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, the world's five most valuable public companies, added $181 billion to their combined market value on Friday.
Investors piled into the group a day after Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings.
 For the stock market, it was more of the same. Those five companies have gained almost $900 billion in market capitalization over the past year. They've each outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017, and have been the top contributors to the index's 15 percent gain.
Despite potential political and regulatory pressures on Google, Facebook and Amazon and loud voices of concern about the tech giants hurting competition and controlling too much of our data, the stock moves reflect financial performance. And the performance is staggering.

 People are clicking on more Google ads. Amazon, which picked up $62 billion in stock market value on Friday, is delivering more of everything. Those two companies plus Microsoft are picking up share of the rapidly growing cloud-computing market. 
Even though Facebook and Apple don't report results until next week, investors drove the stocks up on Friday to the tune of a combined $51.4 billion. Facebook is projected to record 40 percent sales growth on Wednesday. The next day, Apple is expected to report growth of more than 8 percent, thanks to sales of 46 million iPhones, according to FactSet. 
The tech leaders pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record closes on Friday. Rallies don't last forever, but investors aren't finding many reasons to bet against tech.

 CVS-Aetna deal all about vertical integration   
 7:18  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  02:25 
 CVS Health appears to have chosen a friendlier foe in insurers than the Seattle-based giant that has been lurking in the shadows.
 The drugstore operator is in talks to buy health insurer Aetna for a proposed $200 per share or more, sources familiar with the matter say. In owning Aetna, CVS would become the first health-care triple threat: A pharmacy, a pharmacy benefit manager and now an insurer.
The sources declined to be identified because the information is confidential. Aetna and CVS declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported the deal talks. 
 The potential deal would give CVS even more scale to bargain better prices for the prescription drugs it sells on its counters. It could fortify Aetna's insurance business by creating the ability to offer its insured cheaper copayments, presumably only in CVS stores. Its vast retail footprint could serve as a cost-effective distribution center, or locations for in-store clinics. 
It therefore puts insurers, like UnitedHealth Group, which owns a PBM through its Optum health-services business but not a vast store base, directly in its line of fire. (A PBM typically is a third party that negotiates prescription drug benefits for a commercial health plan.)
Insurers might be an easier shot than Amazon. The e-commerce giant, which surged to a market capitalization of $530 billion on Friday, has increasingly signaled its intention to move into the business of selling prescription drugs. It has already received approval for wholesale pharmacy licenses in at least 12 states, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported this week. It will make a decision by Thanksgiving on whether to enter the industry, CNBC has reported.
With Amazon selling drugs, customers would have even less reason to go into CVS stores than they do now. Consumers can now find cosmetic and household staples at other retailers and online, sometimes for a lower price. Its pharmacy business is already larger than its so-called front-of-store business, and it is becoming increasingly so.
For its fiscal 2016, same-store sales from CVS' front-of-store business were down 1.5 percent, while pharmacy sales were up 3.2 percent. The percentage of money it makes from its front store compared with its total revenue fell to 23.6 percent in 2016, from 28.8 percent in 2014.
If past serves as precedent, the battle to fight Amazon can be painful for a company and its shareholders. Since Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, grocery and food stocks have lost a total of $50 billion in market capitalization, CNBC data show. 
By owning an insurer, CVS creates a field more difficult for Amazon to play on. It would be challenging, though conceivable, for Amazon to buy an insurer, due to the particular regulatory constraints they operate under. It would also thus serve as a potential poison pill to fend off any Amazon approaches.
To be sure, CVS also may face regulatory hurdles of its own in an Aetna bid, particularly in a politically charged environment in which the government has been looking at ever-escalating prescription drug costs. 
Beyond Amazon, the move would be a logical progression for CVS, which has been transforming itself into a health-care business for years. It acquired its Caremark pharmacy benefit manager platform in 2007 and in 2014, it changed its name from CVS Caremark to CVS Health.
CVS and Aetna have already begun to test a relationship, having signed a contract to work together in 2010.

 Why Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel are still buys   
 7:17  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  00:57 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer was blown away by the hugely positive earnings reports from the market's top technology companies that tricked in after Thursday's bell.
 ""Who did the best job? Who stole the show? Was it Amazon? Was it Alphabet? Maybe Intel. Could be Microsoft. The answer? All of them, and all for different reasons,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Amazon's third-quarter earnings stole the show with accelerating revenues, a growing customer base, 42 percent sales growth in Amazon Web Services and a busy Prime Day.
 The e-commerce giant's stock soared 13 percent on Friday to a record high of $1,100 per share.
Alphabet's earnings report shined thanks to its 70 percent growth in YouTube, which now delivers 100 million hours of content per day to its users. Shares of the internet colossus climbed over 4 percent on Friday.
""The company has $100 billion in cash, 60 percent of that overseas, which really makes you wish Congress would get its act together on tax reform,"" Cramer noted.
Microsoft blew away Wall Street's earnings estimates by delivering 42 percent growth in subscription revenue from its Office 365 offering and 90 percent revenue growth from Azure, its cloud platform.
As of Friday's closing bell, shares of Microsoft were up more than 6 percent.
Finally, Intel stole the show with its earnings report showing an improving top line, healthy gross margins and signs of recovery in the personal computer segment. On Friday, Intel's stock soared almost 8 percent.
""How is it possible that all of these tech titans are doing so well?"" Cramer said. ""Today's tech strength is all about data. More specifically, the explosion of data via the cloud. Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft are the big three of web services, the backbone of the cloud. Intel's chips for data center servers are being pulled along for the ride.""
As personal computers — Intel's bread and butter — fall back into relevance as a way to access the web, Cramer said other consumer patterns are also changing around this secular trend.
Now, many consumers' jobs and lives revolve around smartphones, and the data center functions as the ""central nervous system"" of the world's communications, Cramer said.
""These firms are all integral to that setup, which is why they can make a fortune here,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Credit to Amazon for seeing it all coming ahead of everyone else. Credit to the other guys for playing catch-up rather than give-up.""
As the big four's stocks continue their journeys higher, Cramer only had one reservation about analyzing their prospects.
""The people who run them are all such visionaries about where things are going that I just can't keep up,"" he said. ""And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why their stocks are really flying higher, and why they're all-stars at the show. [That's] why their growth seems almost unconstrained. And that's why, even after today's moves, the stocks of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel are still all buys.""

 Worth more than $90 billion, according to Forbes,  he took the top spot from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, thanks to recent jumps in the value of Amazon stock after an impressive quarterly financial report.  
But Bezos hasn't always been the billionaire titan he is today. He was born the son of a 16-year-old mom and deadbeat dad. And he didn't set out to be the CEO of an e-commerce juggernaut.

 ""I won the lottery with my mom. Thanks for literally everything, Mom""
 Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen. His biological dad, Ted Jorgensen, met and started dating his mother, Jacklyn Gise, when they were both in high school. Jorgensen was 18 and Gise was 16 when she became pregnant. They flew to Mexico with their parents' money to get married.
Jorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn't have much money. He was also ""had a habit of drinking too much,"" according to ""The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,"" by journalist and biographer Brad Stone. When Jeff Bezos was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen.

 });
 In 1968, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos, who arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba knowing only one word of English: ""hamburger."" Jorgensen agreed to let Bezos adopt his son and, at 4 years old, Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.
Biographer Stone suggests that Bezos' childhood may have contributed to his obsession with success. ""It is of course unknowable whether the unusual circumstances of his birth helped to create that fecund entrepreneurial mix of intelligence, ambition, and a relentless need to prove himself. Two other technology icons, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, were adopted, and the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed,"" Stone writes.
 I won the lottery with my mom. Thanks for literally everything, Mom. pic.twitter.com/gEuVgxotdw— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) May 14, 2017
 Growing up, Bezos spent summers with his grandparents on their Texas ranch,  he says in the commencement speech he gave at Princeton in 2010. ""I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores. We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially 'Days of our Lives,'"" says Bezos.
Bezos would also occasionally get to road trip with his grandparents.
""My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada. And every few summers, we'd join the caravan,"" Bezos says in graduation speech. ""We'd hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips.""
 Launching Amazon: ""I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice""
 Bezos got straight As in high school, was the valedictorian of his class and was accepted early admission to Princeton, according to Stone's biography. For a time in college, he thought he would be a theoretical physicist.
But it was years later, while working in finance in New York City that he had the idea to start Amazon.
""I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles — something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world — was very exciting to me,"" says Bezos, in his 2010 Princeton address.
At the time, Bezos was just 30 and had been married for a year. ""I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most startups don't, and I wasn't sure what would happen after that,"" he says. 
 ""After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.""
-Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, Blue Origin
 His wife told him to go for it.
""As a young boy, I'd been a garage inventor. I'd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings,"" he says. ""I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.""
But not everyone was on board. Bezos boss took a walk through Central Park and told Bezos that, while it sounded like a ""really good idea,"" it would be an even better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good career.
""That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision,"" says Bezos. ""Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all.
""After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.""
 The early days of Amazon: ""I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift""
 When Amazon first started, it sold only books. Bezos would drive the packages to the post office himself in his 1987 Chevy Blazer. ""I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift,"" Bezos tells Charlie Rose in a wide-ranging interview in 2016. ""And it is very, it's very, very different today.""
After books, the next items Bezos added to Amazon were music and videos. Then, he asked customers to see what else they would want to buy from the online retailer.
""I sent an email message out to the customer base, actually a thousand randomly selected customers, and I said, besides books, music and video, what would you like to see us sell? And the list came back incredibly long,"" explains Bezos.  
""It was basically just whatever the person had on their mind right now,"" says Bezos, and that sparked an idea.

 Here's what makes up the Jeff Bezos empire   
 12:48  PM ET Thu, 29 June 2017 |  01:05 
 ""One of customers said, 'I wish you sold windshield wipers because I need windshield wipers for my car.' A light kind of went on in my head. You know, people — people will want to use this new fangled e-commerce way of shopping for everything,"" Bezos says to Rose.
""People are very convenience-motivated,"" says Bezos. ""So that really started the kind of the expansion into all categories, consumer electronics, and then apparel, and so on.""
Expand he did. Today, Amazon sells almost everything. From toilet paper to groceries to electronics to fashion to furniture.
When Bezos enters a new product category, he is not intimidated by a lack of expertise.
""I am never disappointed when we're not good at something because I think, well think how good it's going to work when we are good at it,"" Bezos tells Rose. ""And the apparel is like that. There is so much opportunity. Nobody really knows how to do a great job of offering — apparel online yet. And we have tons of invention and ideas and working our way through that experimental list.""
 Amazon's North star: ""Customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession""
 Bezos has always been a rare combination of optimistic, idealistic and visionary.
Back in 2003, while much of the tech industry was still hungover from the dot-com bust, Bezos was aggressively foretelling the potential of the Internet. ""I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us,"" says Bezos in a TED Talk he gave that year. ""We're very, very early.""

 }
}
 As Bezos charged full force into the Wild West that was the Internet then, he was — and still is today — guided by a single belief: Do what is best for the customer.
""Thing that connects everything that Amazon does is the number one — our number one conviction and idea and philosophy and principle which is customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession. And so we are always focused on the customer, working backwards from the customer's needs, developing new skills internally so that we can satisfy what we perceive to be future customer needs,"" Bezos tells Rose.
Another through line to Bezos' business strategy is his ""willingness to think long-term,"" he says.
""We are very happy to invest in new initiatives that are very risky, for five to seven years, which most companies won't do that,"" Bezos tells Rose. ""It's the combination of the risk-taking and the long-term outlook that make Amazon, not unique, but special in a smaller crowd.""
Finally, he's obsessive about finding problems and fixing them.
""Taking real pride in operational excellence, so just doing things well, finding defects and working backwards — that is all the incremental improvement that in business, most successful companies are very good at this one. ... [Y]ou don't want to ever let defects flow downstream,"" Bezos says to Rose. ""That is a key part of doing a good job in any business in my opinion.""

 The evolution of Jeff Bezos: See if you can recognize him through the years   
 3:57  PM ET Tue, 18 July 2017 |  00:51 
 From e-commerce to media
 As consumer behavior on the web has evolved, so, too has Amazon. Prime, the e-commerce's popular two-day shipping membership comes with access to premium television shows, for example.
Being a content creator built on the back of an e-commerce giant gives Amazon freedom to be creative. For example, one of Amazon's most popular shows, ""Transparent,"" is about a patriarch who becomes a woman later in life. It's won eight Emmys and been nominated for another 28.
""A show like 'Transparent' which has won Golden Globes and Emmys is not ever — it is not a show that could be successfully done on broadcast TV, because broadcast TV needs a much bigger audience,"" says Bezos to Rose. ""And so you can actually think about the creative process a little differently. You can attract different storytellers. You can go for stories that are narrower but incredibly powerful and well told.""
In addition to producing online shows, Bezos is also the owner of another kind of content: journalism. Through his Nash Holdings LLC, he bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million. 
""I bought it because it's important,"" says Bezos. ""I would never buy a financially upside down salty snack food company. You know, that doesn't make any sense to me. But The Washington Post is important. And so it makes sense to me to take something like that, and I also am optimistic. And I thought there were some ways to make it — I want it to be a self-sustaining, profitable enterprise,"" Bezos says to Rose. ""And I think it can be done.""
Bezos' empire now stretches far and wide. Amazon, which currently has a market cap of more than $500 billion, bought Whole Foods in August and also owns companies like Zappos and Twitch. Through Bezos Expeditions, he's also invested in companies like Twitter and Basecamp, among many others.   
 The final frontier: ""I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5""
 While shipping toiletries and downloading books has made Bezos wealthy, his passion is outer space.
 Buzz Aldrin dropped by Blue Origin HQ to say hi to the team yesterday.
 ""This is a childhood dream,"" Bezos says to Rose. ""I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5 years old. I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon. You don't choose your passions, your passions choose you. So I am infected with this idea. I couldn't ever stop thinking about space. I have been thinking about it ever since then.""
To that end, Bezos is the founder of Blue Origin, a company that aims to make space tourism affordable. 
""Basically what I am doing right now is taking my Amazon winnings and investing them. Every time you see me sell stock on Amazon, it's send more money to the Blue Origin team,"" Bezos says to Rose.
In addition to making it possible for more people to travel to space, Bezos says he is building the infrastructure for the next generation of space entrepreneurs.
""[I]f I'm 80 years old, looking back on my life and the one thing I have done is make it so that there is this gigantic entrepreneurial explosion in space for the next generation,"" says Bezos, ""I will be a happy, happy man.""

 Nasdaq and S&P 500 rip to record close after blowout tech earnings; Amazon tops $1,100   
 5:19  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  01:03 
 The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite rose to a record high on Friday as Wall Street cheered the blowout quarterly reports from three of the world's biggest tech companies.
 The index rose 2.2 percent to 6,701.26 and notched its biggest one-day gain since November 2016.
The Nasdaq 100 also hit a record, rising 2.9 percent. The Nasdaq 100 is made up of the 100 largest companies in the composite index.
 The PowerShares QQQ Trust exchange-traded fund, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, rose 2.9 percent.
Leading the ETF higher were shares of Amazon, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet; their stocks rose 13.2 percent, 6.4 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively.
 E-commerce giant Amazon reported earnings per share of 52 cents a share, way ahead of a Thomson Reuters estimate of 3 cents a share. Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud business, was its main driver for growth, with sales leaping 42 percent on a year-over-year basis.
Amazon also received a boost in sales from Whole Foods, which it acquired in late August. The stock broke above $1,100 for the first time on Friday.
""We would characterize last night's Amazon September results as a 'Picasso-like quarter' with the company handily beating all metrics across the board,"" Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, said in a note Friday. ""Last night's quarter ... is another feather in Bezos' cap.""
Microsoft, meanwhile, beat Wall Street earnings expectations by 12 cents a share as its commercial cloud business topped $20 billion in annualized revenue for its fiscal first quarter. The stock posted its biggest one-day gain since October 2015.
Google-parent Alphabet reported adjusted earnings per share of $9.57, well above a Thomson Reuters estimate of $8.33 a share, as the company saw a higher-than-expected surge in the volume of clicks on Google ads across the world, especially in Asia.

 ""We were amazed when we were getting the numbers last night,"" said Randy Warren, CIO at Warren Financial. ""This rally is based on earnings.""
""When you look at why the indexes are moving up, it's because of real earnings growth, and there are no signs of that abating,"" Warren said.
Tech was best-performing sector on Friday, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF popping 2.7 percent and hitting its highest level since 2000.
Information technology has handily outperformed the broader U.S. stock market this year. The sector is up about 30 percent in 2017, while the S&P 500 has gained approximately 15 percent.
The broader market also rose on Friday, receiving a boost from stronger-than-expected economic data. The S&P 500 gained 0.8 percent to finsih at 2,581.07 and hit a record high.
The first reading on third-quarter GDP showed the U.S. economy grew by 3 percent, above an estimate of 2.5 percent.
""There were some inventory disruptions because of the hurricane but the economy is doing pretty well,"" said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds.
Hurricanes Harvey and Irma struck parts of Texas and Florida in late August and early September. Excluding inventory investment, the economy grew at a 2.3 percent rate, slowing from the second quarter's 2.9 percent pace.
Equities have reached record highs recently in part because of improving economic data. Consumer sentiment hit 100.7 in October, just below the expected 100.8.

 CVS is under pressure in their retail pharmacy business: Fmr. Universal American CEO   
 2:23  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  04:12 
 CVS Health shares fell about 6 percent Friday after news broke of its talks to acquire health insurance provider Aetna for $66 billion. But analysts say the drop could be more related to Amazon entering the health-care space, than to pre-acquisition arbitrage.
 ""There is something in play today with Amazon. All that risk, discussion about Amazon going into the pharmacy space. That's putting a lot of pressure today on the whole drug supply chain,"" Jeffries analyst Brian Tanquilut said on CNBC's Power Lunch.
Shares for an acquiring company, like CVS, typically fall before a merger for a number of reasons. The company may take on debt, struggle to culturally integrate or pay a premium for shares. But shortly after news broke of the potential acquisition Thursday, CVS stocks rebounded, suggesting investors supported the idea.
 ""They are under pressure in their retail business, they are under pressure in their retail pharmacy business and they are under pressure in their [pharmacy benefit manager] business, so the need to diversify is pretty important,"" Richard Barasch, former CEO of Universal American said. In 2011, CVS bought Universal American's Medicare prescription drug business for $1.25 billion. 
In an industry where standalone businesses are diminishing, analysts and investors seem to agree that the potential partnership between CVS and Aetna would secure the companies a place in the future health space. Diversifying could steel the Rhode Island-based pharmacy against United Health Care, which has data analytics, pharmacy benefits and physician groups at their disposal.
But Amazon poses new unknowns for the healthcare industry.
""They're terrific at mail order. They are great at distribution,"" Barasch said, describing Amazon.
Experts anticipate it could take the internet commerce company about a decade to even get 10 percent market share, but the market still reacted. CVS shares were trading in tandem with Walgreens Friday afternoon.

 Fierce competition between PBMs: Leerink Partners' Ana Gupte   
 6:40  AM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  03:53 
 CVS talks to buy health insurer Aetna for as much as $66 billion makes sense because the drugstore operator and prescription benefit manager has been facing threats from all sides, including from Amazon, a leading analyst told CNBC on Friday. A deal of this nature would add health insurance plans to the CVS Health portfolio.
 ""CVS has so many threats coming at them,"" said Ana Gupte, a senior health care services analyst at Leerink Partners. She said one threat in particular is from OptumRx, UnitedHealth Group's pharmacy benefit management business. So-called PBMs such as OptumRx and CVS' Caremark unit negotiate drug benefits for insurance plans and employers.
Amazon is also ""clearly a huge piece of this,"" Gupte added in a ""Squawk Box"" interview. The online retail giant has been exploring ways to expand into the drug industry, including selling prescription drugs online.
 Gupte says Amazon is thinking hard about its decision, but she added that ""all signs"" point to Amazon entering into the pharmaceutical industry.
""They may choose to say, 'Hey, should we hurt our brand with all this government scrutiny in an industry and where profit margins are a threat?'"" Gupte said. ""But, Amazon has always been the leader, and margins will compress, and Amazon is fine with that.""
""They're going to disrupt the whole thing like they did for the bookstore industry,"" she added.
When considering the price of the CVS-Aetna deal, Gupte said it represents about a 25 percent premium to Aetna's price, and CVS ""has to do something."" 
Also on ""Squawk Box,"" RBC health-care analyst Frank Morgan said the possible CVS-Aetna deal showcases a reflection of the consolidation happening in the overall health market. 
The moves toward value-based purchasing and consumerization are responsible for the integration of PBMs in health-care businesses, he said.
""Obviously, we're very concerned about health-care inflation here in America,"" Morgan added. 
The deal could improve CVS' competitiveness to offer a fully integrated health insurance and drug service offering, he said.

 Amazon shares surge 11% to all-time high   
 2:00  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  00:57 
 Wall Street is buzzing over Amazon's impressive September quarter results.
 Analysts say they are growing more confident Amazon's success will continue because of its proven ability to invest in new opportunities.
The e-commerce juggernaut generated third-quarter earnings per share of 52 cents, handily beating the 3 cent Thomson Reuters consensus estimate.
 Its shares hit a new all-time high Friday and closed up 13 percent after reporting the results after the closing bell Thursday. Around midday they rose above $1100 for the first time ever.
""Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and operating income, driven by strong Prime Day signups,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju in a note to clients on Friday. ""And once again it demonstrated accelerating growth across all e-commerce reporting segments.""
The analyst said the strong growth was the result of the company's massive investment spending. Amazon had $5.7 billion in capital expenditures during the third quarter, $300 million more than he expected.

 Amazon shares break above $1,100 for the first time   
 12:51  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  01:03 
 ""We have always believed that Amazon continues to allocate capital as a function of consumer and enterprise demand for its services across e-commerce and AWS,"" he wrote, referring to Amazon Web Services, the company's web hosting operation. The third-quarter result ""serves as the confirmation of the rationale for the investment cycle that began in 3Q16.""
Ju reaffirmed his outperform rating on the shares and raised his price target to $1,385 from $1,350. The new target is 42 percent higher than Thursday's closing price.
Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said he believes Amazon's big investments are driving growth for its Prime subscription services, which is then spurring stronger sales.
The Amazon ""results reinforced again our long-standing thesis that investment in the assets behind AMZN's competitive moats (fulfillment, digital content, AWS) continues to drive the Prime flywheel effect,"" Thill wrote Friday. ""Subscription rev growth accelerated in Q3 on strong Prime membership growth driven by above-expectations Prime Day results which also drove higher than expected results internationally.""
Thill reiterated his buy rating and raised his price target on Amazon shares to $1,350 from $1,250.
One analyst said he is optimistic that Amazon's scale and track record will help it maintain strong growth rates. Third-quarter sales rose 34 percent from the same period last year, to $43.7 billion.
""Amazon is one of the highest quality companies in the internet sector considering its consistent innovation and execution, the size of the opportunities it is pursuing, and its positioning within those future growth opportunities,"" Citi Research analyst Mark May wrote Friday. ""We believe the company is positioned well relative to a number of growth vectors in the Internet sector and see upside to shares considering its compelling growth versus industry peers.""
Amazon has been one of the best-performing large-cap stocks in the market. Its shares rallied 30 percent this year through Thursday versus the S&P 500's 14 percent gain.

 Amazon cemented its long-term interest in the grocery industry when it spent nearly $14 billion to acquire Whole Foods earlier this year. Now it's making a subtler move aimed at improving its own grocery selection online.
Amazon recently told businesses that sell non-perishable grocery items on Amazon.com that it was lowering the fee it charges them on items priced at $15 or less. Amazon previously charged 15 percent on all grocery items, but will now charge only 8 percent on the lower-priced goods for at least the next year.
""To help you list more products and keep prices competitive, we are offering you a limited-time referral fee discount on Grocery products,"" the email said, according to a copy forwarded to Recode. ""This fee promotion starts at 12:00 a.m. October 15, 2017 (PST), and will run through 11:59 p.m. October 14, 2018 (PST).""
 The move could be looked at as a competition-focused one: While Walmart also charges 15 percent across the board for grocery items sold through its online marketplace, its subsidiary Jet.com charges only 10 percent for most non-gourmet packaged foods, according to its website.
Perhaps more importantly, though, the fee reduction also seems like an acknowledgement that  it's difficult for businesses to make a reasonable profit when selling some inexpensive groceries online.
Take, for example, a business that wants to sell a 40-ounce jar of peanut butter that retails for $5.49. The easiest way to make the product eligible for the Prime shipping program is to store it in an Amazon warehouse under its Fulfilled By Amazon — or FBA — program.
But the FBA storage-and-shipping fee alone for this one jar would be about $4.44 — in part because of its weight — and that's before you factor in the cost for the seller to make or acquire the product as well as Amazon's 15 percent commission under the previous fee structure. The economics don't really work.
As a result, sellers and grocery brands have had to come up with alternatives to sell these lower-priced grocery staples through Amazon. One popular option is selling a certain product in a more-expensive bulk pack, as you might find in a Costco or BJ's Wholesale Club.
Others sell their items at a wholesale price to Amazon, which then funnels the low-priced goods into membership programs such as Prime Pantry or Amazon Fresh.
The Prime Pantry program lets Prime members fill a box full of grocery items but it costs $5.99 per box for shipping. Amazon also sells low-priced grocery items through Amazon Fresh, but that grocery program costs $14.99 a month in addition to the regular $99-a-year Prime membership fee.
Still, Amazon recognizes that there are plenty of Amazon customers that will never pay for either program and it still wants those people to think of Amazon as a grocery destination. The problem is it'll never win that perception by only selling bulk-size packs.
That's the context that likely played a big part in Amazon's decision to lower its fee. (Amazon declined to comment.) The question is whether the reduction is a real solution to the problem.
David Rekuc, the marketing directing for the e-commerce consultancy Ripen eCommerce, is skeptical that it is. While he believes there are some types of grocery items that might become profitable with the fee reduction, Rekuc says FBA fees or the cost for a seller to ship the item themselves still make it difficult to profitably sell a single unit of a low-priced grocery item — despite the lower commission.
""It's nice to see and it may move the needle a little bit,"" he said of the fee discount, ""but it won't fundamentally change [Amazon's] penetration in grocery.""

 Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Intel topped earnings expectations when the companies reported their quarterly results after the market close on Thursday. 
 Shares of the tech giants popped on Friday following the earnings beats: Intel closed up 7.38 percent, Amazon soared 13.22 percent, Alphabet jumped 4.26 percent and Microsoft rose 6.4 percent on the day. That led the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite to a record close of 6,701.26 on Friday.
Ahead, Facebook is expected to release its results on Nov. 1. Apple and Alibaba are due to report a day later.
 As of Oct. 27, 74 percent of the 231 companies in the S&P 500 index that have announced results have beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

 Note that this data doesn't include sales from private companies like Stitch Fix, the personal styling online retailer that filed to go public last week, so these companies' true market share is likely smaller.
E-commerce sales are a small but rapidly growing share of U.S. retail, and Amazon is by far the leader. Amazon now represents close to 4 percent of all retail sales online and off in the U.S., according to eMarketer. E-commerce sales will increase 15.8 percent to $452.8 billion by the end of 2017, according to the research firm's estimates.

 Einhorn's Greenlight wraps up a 'very challenging' last few days   
 7:19  PM ET Tue, 31 Oct 2017 |  01:17 
 Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn said October started out strong but has ended on a sour note: He doesn't expect to show gains for the month.
 ""The last few days have been very challenging,"" the hedge fund manager said on a conference all Tuesday morning. Results for the month aren't expected to be ""materially different from zero.""
The fund is one of General Motors' biggest shareholders, with 3.7 percent of the shares, a position that had done well this year, rising 24 percent. But GM had a sharp sell-off this week when some prominent analysts questioned the sustainability of sales. Einhorn lost a proxy contest earlier this year to get seats on GM's board.
 Share prices of GM were up fractionally Tuesday, a day after falling 3 percent. They are down more than 6 percent in the last week, according to FactSet. 
After the conference call another Greenlight holding hit turbulence: shares of the drug-maker Mylan dropped 8 percent Tuesday after a Bloomberg News report the company's president, Rajiv Malik, was the target of a price-collusion investigation. Greenlight holds 2 percent of Mylan shares and already reported difficulty with it after delays in new drug approvals weighed on the stock.
But Einhorn said in last week's investor letter that he was ""excited about the upside potential,"" citing Mylan's generic drug offerings. Shares of  Mylan are up 11.7 percent for the month but down 8 percent for the year.
In a statement, Mylan said, ""We have been investigating these allegations thoroughly and have found no evidence of price fixing on the part of Mylan or its employees.... Mylan has deep faith in the integrity of its President, Rajiv Malik, and stands behind him fully. Mylan and Rajiv Malik both intend to defend this case vigorously, and we look forward to the opportunity to present a full defense.""
Greenlight is also struggling with its ""bubble short"" positions, or bets against three high-flying tech companies it sees as having operational or profitability issues. Shares of Amazon are up 15 percent this month and 47 percent for the year, while shares of Netflix are up 8.7 percent for the month and 59 percent for the year. Tesla, on the other hand, is down 5 percent for the month. It is up 50 percent this year, however.
Last week, Einhorn sent out an investor letter that lamented the seeming end of value investing as a winning strategy. Value investors hunt for undervalued stocks of companies that are performing well. ""Given the performance of certain stocks, we wonder if the market has adopted an alternative paradigm for calculating equity value,"" he wrote in the letter.  
Greenlight Capital gained 6.2 percent in the the third quarter and is up 3.3 percent for the year compared with the more than 14 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 this year.

Jeff Bezos
 The comedian Dana Carvey once asked the question, ""Don't you love the pharmacy?"" The 5-minute bit that followed highlighted all the awkward, confusing, and often frustrating elements of the pharmacy experience. The audience was with him the whole time. 
 Whether or not Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos watched Carvey's show, many in the industry agree that pharmacy is primed for disruption -- starting with home delivery. In fact, despite the best efforts of a group of companies called pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs), such as CVS Caremark and Express Scripts, mail order pharmacies only fill a paltry 1 out of every 10 prescriptions. Most of the 4 billion prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. every year are filled at one of 60,000 retail pharmacy locations.
That should seem surprising, as the vast majority of prescriptions are refills of ongoing medications. And that makes it ideal for home delivery.
 So a recent report that Amazon had acquired pharmacy wholesaler licenses sparked a major wave of excitement in the industry. After all, Amazon had hinted at their potential ambitions last spring when they contacted several industry experts about pharmacy and PBMs, as reported by CNBC. Speculation was further fueled by the acquisition of Whole Foods. A retail base coupled with mail order could be an attractive pharmacy or foundation for a PBM. Add these new so-called pharmaceutical wholesaler licenses into the mix and all the pieces seemed to be coming together.
Except that it isn't. At least not yet.
 What do the licenses mean?
 The reported pharmacy wholesale licenses that Amazon acquired in 12 states is not a clear signal that the company is entering the pharmacy or pharmaceutical distribution business. The licenses Amazon applied for happen to cover the distribution of medical-surgical equipment, devices, and other healthcare related equipment, a business they are in today. The confusion results from the fact that states lump many types of distributors together in the same databases, using the same licensing forms.
What many of the ensuing media reports failed to mention is that becoming a pharmaceutical distributor or pharmacy entails additional licensure at both the state and national level.
If Amazon was entering the pharmaceutical distribution business they would need to become a ""Verified Accredited Wholesale Distributor"" (VAWD) by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP). Amazon is not one of the 607 VAWD certified facilities. The laws in Indiana require VAWD certification prior to operation.
Bottom line: Amazon doesn't have any licenses to distribute or dispense prescription medications, in Indiana or any other state.
 What's next? Drones? 
 At this point, I'm asking myself how hard would it be for Amazon to actually get VAWD-certified and/or operate a pharmacy or PBM. The answer? Not very hard at all.
Amazon could either buy or build most of the software, hardware, and teams needed to start a pharmacy operation (dispensing or wholesale). Getting state licenses could take a matter of months, and not years. A budget of a few hundred million would accomplish this job, a small portion of Amazon's $16 billion annual R&D budget.
Could Amazon distribute pharmaceuticals to their own Whole Foods pharmacies in conjunction with a Amazon mail order pharmacy? Absolutely. This would enable Amazon to control their own supply chain. Perhaps they would manufacture their own generic medications like many wholesalers do. Brand drug manufacturers might welcome Amazon, at least initially, as an additional channel to reach consumers. Frankly, and in my opinion, the most challenging part for Amazon would be dealing with PBMs.
Most importantly, could Amazon transform the retail pharmacy and mail experience with a combination of self-service kiosks, lockers, delivery services, and even drones?
Something tells me that something big is going to happen in pharmacy -- and soon. Maybe there's even an opportunity for a combined distribution, pharmacy, and PBM. It's hard to believe any company is better positioned to make one or all of these happen than Amazon. And making pharmacy less of a talking-point for comedians would be very pleasant side effect indeed.

 Amazon has secured three new domain names related to cryptocurrency, sparking speculation that the e-commerce giant could be preparing a move into the cryptocurrency space. 
 However, Amazon Pay's VP Patrick Gauthier told CNBC last month that Amazon had no plans to accept cryptocurrency because there hasn't been much demand yet, and Amazon may simply be protecting its brand name.
The domains are: amazonethereum.com, amazoncryptocurrency.com, amazoncryptocurrencies.com.

 3:58  PM ET Wed,  1 Nov 2017 |  01:05 
 Trade publication DomainNameWire was the first to report on Amazon's move. The report said Amazon registered for the domains on Tuesday.
The news comes as bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, smashed through a new record high price on Wednesday, reaching $6,600 for the first time, following news of CME's plan to launch bitcoin futures later this year.
There have been some rumors of Amazon eventually accepting cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, but the company has never acknowledged these plans. Just last month, another unfounded rumor about Amazon's acceptance of bitcoin drove up bitcoin's price immediately.
In any case, Amazon seems intent on owning multiple cryptocurrency-related domain names. According to Coindesk, Amazon signed up for the domain ""amazonbitcoin.com"" three years ago. Amazonbitcoin.com now takes you straight to Amazon.com.

 The prospect that Amazon will enter the pharmacy space has cast a pall over stocks of drug distributors and retail pharmacies, erasing hundreds of millions of dollars from their market value.
 But in another sector of the drug space, Amazon's entry would be welcomed: pharmaceutical companies.
""Just like science is disrupted with gene therapy or novel treatments, I think the drug distribution channel also should be disrupted with improvements based on technology or efficiency,"" Allergan CEO Brent Saunders told analysts on the company's third-quarter conference call Wednesday.
 Pfizer chief Ian Read made similar comments in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday.
""We haven't had any conversations with them [Amazon],"" Read said, but we're ""more than willing to talk to anybody who can ensure"" the efficiency of the distribution system.
Amazon is considering an entry into the space, with a decision expected as soon as Thanksgiving. Last week, news that Amazon had secured wholesale pharmacy licenses in 12 states further fueled speculation – though experts say those licenses don't facilitate an entry into drug distribution; they support Amazon's existing business in medical equipment.
Still, conviction – or hope – runs high that Amazon is interested in pharmacy. Wells Fargo analyst David Maris, who covers drug companies, points out that the URL AmazonRx.com is registered to the Amazon Legal Department.
""We do not see the Amazon threat alleviating any time soon,"" wrote David Larsen and Matt Dellelo, analysts covering the drug supply chain space for Leerink, in an Oct. 31 research note. ""While these licenses may be related to other health-care products and devices, in our view it is likely that Amazon will eventually get into the pharmacy services space.""
Most exposed, they wrote, are retailers – CVS, Walgreens and Rite-Aid – followed by drug distributors – McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health.
Others have focused on Amazon's potential to disrupt the pharmacy benefit manager – or PBM – space, which is dominated by three major players: Express Scripts, CVS Caremark and UnitedHealth's Optum.
PBMs, in addition to operating mail-order pharmacies, negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers and employers, which can often lead to adversarial relationships with pharma companies.
""I've always thought that the current system is pretty inefficient, when you have PBMs, the pharmacy benefit managers, between the manufacturers and the ultimate users,"" said Joel Marcus, CEO of Alexandria Real Estate, which caters to life science companies.
If Amazon entered the space, Marcus told analysts on the company's third-quarter conference call this week, ""it's going to rationalize the system.""
Another biopharma CEO, speaking on the condition of anonymity, put it more bluntly: ""We'd be fools not to consider anyone who can disrupt the insurance/PBM stranglehold these companies have over patients and us.""
To be sure, many point out the pharmacy space is complicated and heavily regulated, which could deter Amazon from pursuing it.
""We'll see on the pharmacy side; there's a lot of regulation there, a lot of red tape,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson, who covers Amazon, said on Squawk Box Friday. As an example, he pointed to Amazon's wine business.
""They're in the business of shipping wine across state lines right now, and they're looking at getting out of that, because that has too much regulation,"" Olson said. ""So I'm not 100% convinced they're going to be getting into the pharmacy space, but we'll see.""
Some in the drug industry argue that's precisely why Amazon could successfully disrupt the pharmaceutical supply chain.
""It's an area rife with inefficiency and a lot of turf,"" said the aforementioned biopharma CEO. ""It's overly complicated; that's the opportunity.""

 Amazon should buy these companies if it wants to get into selling drugs, say experts   
 12:21  PM ET Thu,  2 Nov 2017 |  00:59 
 Amazon has been mulling getting into the prescription drug business.
 Amazon is already in a range of businesses that touch on the multitrillion medical sector, including selling surgical equipment and supplies, as well as its cloud software services which many big health-care companies use. 
But if it wants to get into selling prescriptions, it might speed its time to market by making a buy-up of a company already in the space. There's a precedent in Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of grocery store chain Whole Foods earlier this year. Amazon has about $13 billion in cash and equivalents, as of September of this year. 
 So we asked 5 experts for their predictions on the companies that Amazon might look to acquire if it decides to move ahead with becoming an online pharmacy. Their answers have been edited for brevity. 
 Prediction: Premier 
 Scott Barclay, partner at venture fund DCVC and former vice president at e-prescription software provider Surescripts.
What is it?  A group purchasing organization created to allow hospitals and other providers to pool their purchasing power to secure discounts on medical and other hospital supplies.
Why? According to Barclay, it's a no-brainer for Amazon to buy a group purchasing organization or ""GPO."" And Premier is the largest in the U.S., with a network of more than 3,750 U.S. hospitals and 130,000 other providers. 
What's in it for Amazon? ""It's a low-cost way to break into the (drug) supply chain that touches a large chunk of health care GDP,"" Barclay said. ""Amazon would quickly create a multibillion-dollar business without fundamentally taking on much risk or even being very innovative.""
Another benefit, according to Barclay, is that it buys Amazon time. It could pick and choose if it wants to go after more challenging opportunities like data and informatics, care provision and health insurance.
Any cons? Premier, which went public in 2013, wouldn't come cheap — it's currently got a market cap over $4 billion, and revenue jumped 15 percent to $1.16 billion in fiscal 2016. It has also been on a buying spree of its own of late to strengthen its market position. 
 Prediction: Express Scripts 
 Dr. Mark Frisse, Department of Biomedical Informatics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and former chief medical officer at Express Scripts.
What is it? Express Scripts is the largest pharmacy benefits manager in the United States. These companies, known as PBMs, act as intermediaries between payers, like health insurers, and the rest of the health system. 
Why? The culture fit. Amazon and ExpressScripts have a lot in common, according to Frisse. ""These companies have the same business acumen, market discipline, and mastery of logistics and delivery."" 
ExpressScripts could take on a job that Amazon might want to avoid, suggests Frisse. ""Its team brings to the table the capabilities of managing a Byzantine and arcane process of pharmacy regulation,"" he said. As Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth told analysts in July, it's far more complicated than just dispensing drugs. Entering the business, ""requires you to figure out how not to dispense drugs or to dispense the right drugs as much as it does to dispense them.""
Why not? It would be a massive purchase — Express Scripts has a market cap of more than $35 billion, more than twice the price Amazon paid for Whole Foods, and the company would have to borrow to take that on. It might be an easier option for Amazon to buy a small or midsized pharmacy benefits manager at a lower price, and still gain the national footprint and regulatory expertise. 
 Prediction: Glooko 
 Nina Kjellson, Canaan Partners' biotech and health IT investor (note: Glooko is a Canaan portfolio company).
What is it? Glooko is a subscription-based diabetes management web and mobile app for patients and their health providers. It claims to have millions of users worldwide. 
Why? Kjellson sees Amazon having a big impact in public health, especially in areas like obesity and diabetes. With Amazon already starting to sell medical supplies online, Kjellson sees the company carving out a big business in diabetes prescription medications and glucose meters/ strips, which is a $70 billion market and growing. ""So Amazon should pick up a diabetes management platform like Glooko to have a consumer and health-care solution that ties the entire disease management ecosystem together in a great, consumer experience.""
Another bonus? As Amazon gets into the grocery business in the wake of its Whole Foods buy-up, it could consider personalized meal recommendations — a benefit for millions of people managing chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes.
Why not? Privacy. Amazon already knows so much about its customers through their buying habits. Some users might be uncomfortable sharing their health status. Moreover, managing populations with chronic diseases is not Amazon's core competency.  
 Prediction: GoodRX
 Annie Lamont, managing partner at investment firm Oak HC/FT.
What is it? GoodRx offer coupons that consumers can take to the pharmacy to get discounts on prescription drugs. It claims to have lower prices than what a consumer would otherwise pay out of pocket. 
Why? ""It's the most successful consumer-facing app for prescription drugs that is focused on comparing and giving the consumer the lowest cost,"" said Lamont. And that's an ideal fit for Amazon, which prides itself on transparency. GoodRx founder Doug Hirsch has also publicly stated that he would welcome Amazon's long-rumored entry into the space. 
Why not? ""Valuation,"" suggests Lamont. GoodRx hasn't raised much in funding — $1.5 million in seed financing and an additional follow-on sum that hasn't been disclosed — but has grown quickly since its 2012 launch and established itself as one of the biggest players in the space. 
Any big risks? GoodRx has contracts with pharmacy benefits managers and retailers behind the scenes, explains Lamont. So there's always a risk that they pull out, if they're feeling threatened by Amazon. 
 Prediction: PillPack 
 Stephen Buck, co-founder of cancer-advisory site Courage Health and co-founder of GoodRx.
What is it? Pillpack is an online pharmacy start-up that delivers prescriptions by mail in personalized packets, based on when the user needs to take them.
Why? If Amazon got into the business of selling prescription drugs, PillPack seems like an obvious pick to Buck. ""It's a direct-to-consumer company that would fit nicely into Amazon's Prime delivery service,"" he said.
A good deal: PillPack also isn't encumbered by a large retail operation, Buck said, meaning it doesn't have a huge network of brick-and-mortar pharmacies. For that reason, it might also be ""relatively cheap to buy,"" he suggests, despite that it has raised more than $117 million in financing from venture investors to date. 
Why not? The product might be too niche for Amazon, suggests Buck. ""The whole experience including the packaging might only appeal to a certain segment of people who take multiple medications.""

 });It seems too easy to be true that you could make millions by raiding the clearance aisle at your local Walmart or Target and then selling your haul on Amazon. But that's exactly what 28-year-old Ryan Grant is doing.
 Only four years after quitting his accounting job in Minneapolis, Minn., to flip purchases full-time, his business is making well into the six figures in profits per year.
""Pretty early on I realized I wasn't in the career path that I wanted to be on,"" he tells CNBC Make It. ""That experience really had me looking for other options and I was starting to explore ways that I could basically leave that job and have my own schedule and be on my own time.""
 To do that, Grant turned to the side hustle he had used to made ends meet in college.
 Ryan Grant
Ryan Grant spent 30 hours a week searching Walmart and other local retailers for products that he could flip on Amazon.
 As a student at Winona State University, he organized textbook buyback events on campus twice a year. He listed the books on Amazon and shipped them out to customers around the country for a profit of up to $10,000 a year.

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 The process worked simply enough: Using the Amazon Seller app he could see exactly how much he could expect to profit on each book and in what time frame. But the hours spent processing and packaging each order himself proved to be a bit much.
""Going through that process for one semester was enough to know that I didn't want to do it again,"" he says. ""From there forward I did Fulfillment by Amazon the rest of the way.""
Using Amazon's fulfillment services meant he could ship all the books in bulk using preferred UPS rates to an Amazon warehouse, where, for a fee, the online retailer handled processing and shipping out each individual order. It made his side hustle more manageable, time-wise. 
And, when Grant grew more unfulfilled at his accounting job, it sparked the idea of going online to flip more than just textbooks.
 Ryan Grant
Grant scans items using InventoryLab's Scoutify 2 app (left) which reveals detailed sales data for a given product on Amazon.
 After work and on the weekends, he scoped out the clearance aisles at Walmart, scanned a few items using Amazon's app and bought up toys, games, and home improvement items he realized he could re-sell for a profit. A receipt from his early days shows a variety of purchases, everything from vacuums to Barbies, LEGO sets to stainless steel flatware.
""I was putting in about 10 hours per week and I was making in the ballpark of $1,000 per month,"" he recalls. Once he was able to make the same kind of money reselling on Amazon as he had made at his accounting job, in September 2013, he quit.
""I was confident that if I had full-time hours to dedicate to selling online that I would be able to more or less scale that up,"" Grant says. Just three months later, in December, he notched $9,000 in profit on over $25,000 in total sales.
""Making that amount of money in one month was a big boost in my confidence to be able to scale up further from there,"" he says.
 Ryan Grant
Coming across a product worth flipping on Amazon meant buying out the store.
 Boxes upon boxes destined for Amazon warehouses started stacking up in Grant's duplex so, in the spring of 2014, he rented out a 725-foot warehouse. He packed his Mazda 626 full of products on runs back and forth from other brand-name retailers like Target and Toys R Us.
""It was starting to basically take over my life because I'm coming home and there's product all over my house,"" he recalls. When the 30 hours of shopping and the 15 hours of preparing shipments each week became too much to handle alone, Grant hired his first employee, a friend who could help scour local stores.
Eventually it got easier to target the items that had the biggest opportunity for arbitrage. Seasonality, they realized, was a key factor. They could, for example, buy up discounted candy after Halloween and half-priced Christmas decorations around the New Year.
 Ryan Grant
When Ryan Grant's kitchen was overflowing with boxes he was shipping to Amazon, he made the call to rent a warehouse.
 ""Believe it or not, there's actually people buying those items out of season,"" Grant laughs. Still, even he was surprised at how quickly the business took off from there.
""I went from just me in this business doing around three-to-five thousand dollars in sales per month and now, four years later, we're a team of 11 and we're doing well over $200,000 in sales per month,"" Grant says. The team had to move to a warehouse that's over five times as large as their first this past July.
Since he started selling on Amazon, Grant says the business is on track to top $8 million in total sales by the end of this year. Profits are heavily reinvested back into the company, though Grant was still able to take a salary of around $150,000 when he was working for the venture full time. 
The team also made mistakes made along the way. They lost $6,000 when a faulty nail filing product for dogs got Grant's Amazon seller account temporarily suspended, for example. They also had to pay the fees Amazon charges for products that failed to sell and sat idly in Amazon's warehouses. 
 Ryan Grant
After outgrowing his first warehouse, Grant's business expanded to a 3,800-square-foot office.
 All the same, Grant believes he has found an easy and effective formula for success. ""I think anyone can do it if they're willing to put in the work,"" he says.
As his business is increasingly run by his team, Grant has reduced his salary down to $60,000 a year and now dedicates much of his time to getting that message out. He consults and teaches e-commerce classes through the same blog he has been using to track his performance. His hope is that he might be able to help a few people who might not be happy at their jobs find the same independence he did.
""I was just looking to have freedom of schedule and replace the income that I had from that job and now it's turned into a lot more than that,"" he says. ""I mean, I would be sitting in an office cubicle now or working at a client location as opposed to doing what I want to do effectively when I want to do it.""

 Kroger fights back at Amazon with an apparel brand   
 5:20  PM ET Fri,  3 Nov 2017 |  00:50 
 Kroger, in the aftermath of the Amazon-Whole Foods deal, aims to be a destination for more than just groceries.
 The supermarket chain announced Friday morning that it's launching an apparel brand in the fall of next year.
Kroger shares were climbing about 2 percent in early trade on the news.
 This news comes after the Ohio-based company outlined its ""Kroger Restock"" initiative at an investor day last month.
The plan will consist of heavy capital investments — $9 billion over the next three years. Meantime, Kroger is exploring strategic alternatives, with the help of Goldman Sachs, for its convenience-store business, including a potential sale.
A move into apparel is part of ""Kroger Restock,"" the company said Friday.
""This new [apparel] brand gives Kroger a chance to inspire and connect with our customers, offering effortless style every day — from elevated basics to fashionable highlights,"" Robert Clark, Kroger's senior vice president of merchandising, said in a statement.
""This new offering is on-trend, convenient, and right in line with our customers' needs,"" Clark added.
The brand will first roll out across Fred Meyer and Kroger Marketplace stores, which account for 300 locations nationwide, in late 2018.
Kroger described the line as ""modern,"" ""playful"" and ""simple,"" and there will initially be sizes for children, young men, juniors, men and women. There will also be a focus on activewear, the company said.
Kroger aims to drive more shoppers to its stores as competition intensifies among supermarkets, and Amazon is growing quickly with Whole Foods.
Lidl, a German-based grocer that's expanding rapidly across the U.S., also sells apparel and recently launched an exclusive line with celebrity designer Heidi Klum.
Another example of this, big-box chains Wal-Mart and Target are known for offering both groceries and clothing to customers within the same stores. The overlap is one way to make up for slimmer margins within the grocery aisles.
Kroger shares have fallen around 38 percent this year.

SoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son
 SoftBank's Masayoshi Son dinged Amazon during an earnings call Monday, saying his investments in rival e-commerce companies are outperforming the American giant.
 Son's SoftBank has invested in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, Yahoo! Japan Shopping, sports e-commerce company Fanatics and India-based Flipkart.  
""E-commerce as a business model, [is] now becoming the essential business model for our society,"" Son said during the briefing. ""Amazon is still making a loss in e-commerce.""
 Amazon's international e-commerce segment posted a net loss of $936 million when it reported third-quarter earnings last week. 
Son said that his focus has been on the companies' growing customer base and market share — and that his investments are successfully rivaling Amazon in Asian markets. 
Yahoo! Japan Shopping maintains the biggest e-commerce selection in Japan with more than 290 million items, Flipkart holds 60 percent of the e-commerce market in India and Alibaba has grown net revenue by 61 percent in the last year, Son said. 
""The transaction for them is actually much bigger than Amazon, and every e-commerce all total – or is equivalent or even bigger in Alibaba. So, it's overwhelming, No. 1.""
SoftBank reported fiscal second-quarter profit of 395.6 billion yen ($3.5 billion) Monday, up from 328.1 billion yen a year earlier. SoftBank shares closed down 2.6 percent in Tokyo on Monday.

 });Leaving a comfortable job on Wall Street to launch an unpredictable business is a risk many would be scared to take — but it was that risk that allowed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to become a billionaire.
 At Summit Series in Los Angles, Bezos sat down with his brother Mark to talk about his journey to entrepreneurship and the factors that influenced his success. 
In 1994, Bezos was working as a software engineer on Wall Street. According to TechCrunch, Bezos told his boss that he wanted to launch an Internet book store. His boss agreed it was a good idea, but warned him that ""it was a better idea for someone who didn't have a good job.""

 Bezos took a few days to consider that advice and tried a mental exercise. He said he realized ""the best way to think about it was to project my life forward to age 80."" 
That way, he could make a decision that ""minimized [his] regrets."" Bezos said it became obvious that he should leave his job to start Amazon.

 ""If it failed, I would be very proud when I was 80 that I tried,"" he says, according to TechCrunch.
When Amazon first launched in 1994, the company sold only books, and Bezos would drive packages to the post office in his 1987 Chevy Blazer. The company expanded to offer music and videos, and finally Bezos asked his customers what else they wanted to buy from the online retailer.
Today, Amazon sells everything from electronics to household goods and furniture. That wouldn't be possible if Bezos hadn't taken that leap more than 20 years ago.  
""After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice,"" he said in a 2010 baccalaureate address at Princeton. 
You can either choose a life of ""ease and comfort,"" Bezos told his brother during the Summit Series interview, or a life of ""service and adventure.""
""When you're 80,"" he said, ""you'll be proud of the latter.""

 How Salesforce-Google will help buck Amazon   
 6:58  PM ET Tue,  7 Nov 2017 |  01:09 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer knows that playing offense and defense at the same time isn't easy, especially for a business.
 ""Yet whenever I speak to a truly competitive company, that's exactly what they're doing — playing both offense and defense using the power of digital, using the power of technology. They have no choice; if they don't embrace technology they'll be left behind,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
That's why Cramer saw Salesforce.com's partnership with Alphabet's Google, which was announced on Monday, as so important.
 The combination would pair Salesforce's customer relations management systems with Google's analytics and cloud platforms, giving clients more holistic ways to view customer data.
Cramer said the partnership would benefit retailers that compete with Amazon and would prefer not to pay for Amazon Web Services for their cloud-based needs.
""You don't pay your opponent when you're fighting them tooth and nail, not if you can avoid it,"" Cramer said. ""The problem has been that Amazon Web Services, with its amazing analytics that works seamlessly with Salesforce, really does give you an edge you couldn't find anywhere else, at least not until this Salesforce-Google team-up.""
The ""Mad Money"" host pointed to Monday's reports of Amazon launching its first two furniture brands, a sign that the e-commerce colossus could be moving into the furniture industry. 
Whether Amazon will make a wholehearted effort to enter the furniture space remains unclear, but furniture stocks from RH to Williams-Sonoma still suffered considerable losses on the news.
Cramer said that Amazon Web Services (which also partners with Salesforce) gives those retailers advantages in telling their stories and reaching new customers.
But if Amazon becomes a direct competitor, paying for its services becomes less attractive, particularly with Google offering a similarly effective analytics and marketing platform, he said.
""It's defense and it's offense. And judging by the declines of the stocks in the brick-and-mortar segment of this market ... it seems like not enough companies in that sector have a digital strategy that is strong on both sides of the field,"" Cramer said.
But companies, especially retailers, with a sound digital strategy now have an alternative to Amazon that could help them maintain their competitive streak against the e-commerce colossus.
""The bottom line is, no matter what the industry, if you own shares in a company that doesn't have not a digital strategy, but a winning digital strategy, your goose is cooked, as the other guys in the sector will set the oven at 500 degrees and burn your stock to a crisp,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.

Dara Khosrowshahi
 Uber's new CEO had employees write and vote on cultural guidelines for the workplace — and the results should look familiar to anyone that works in the technology industry. 
 There were about 1,200 submissions from Uber employees, and the final rules were voted on 22,000 times, according to CEO  Dara Khosrowshahi, who shared the results on LinkedIn.
The results were: 
 We build globally, we live locally. We are customer obsessed.  We celebrate differences.  We do the right thing.  We act like owners.  We persevere. We value ideas over hierarchy.  We make big bold bets.  
Uber was tasked with creating new cultural guidelines after a searing workplace culture report,  compiled in part by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his firm, Covington & Burling, after sexual harassment allegations surfaced. The report, supported by Uber's board, recommended Uber replace its previous 14 cultural values, which included ""Let builders build,"" ""always be hustlin'"", ""meritocracy and toe-stepping"", and ""principled confrontation."" 
Some of the core principles, like being ""obsessed"" with the customer and being ""bold"" carried over to Uber's new guidelines, while others, like ""meritocracy,"" were reformulated. 
But while Uber's old manifesto included unique slang like ""super-pumpedness,"" the new version looks a lot like the ones across Silicon Valley. For instance, one of Facebook's core values is ""be bold,"" and ""do the right thing"" isn't so different than Google's ""don't be evil."" Being customer-obsessed and treating employees like owners are both tenets in Amazon CEO Jeff Bezo's 1997 shareholder letter. The ride-hailing start-up, which has ambitions to disrupt transportation on a larger scale, also borrows from a saying common in urban planning, ""think globally, act locally.""
The similarities emphasize Uber's enormous size, which has quickly grown to be more like a publicly traded tech giant than a scrappy start-up. Facebook made a similar change, dropping the slogan ""move fast and break things"" in 2014 in favor of putting people first. Khosrowshahi, who has been Uber CEO since late August, has said he's preparing the company to go public.
""It's that forward-leaning, fearless approach that has underpinned much of Uber's success and has attracted many employees, including me, to the company,"" Khosrowshahi wrote in Tuesday's post. ""But it's also clear that the culture and approach that got Uber where it is today is not what will get us to the next level.""

 An even bigger rally is in store for Amazon: Trader   
 2:38  PM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  03:01 
 Amazon hit yet another all-time high Tuesday, and TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon says the charts are hinting the e-commerce giant could soon reach a new milestone.
 ""You can see that [Amazon has made a very nice uptrend in 2017],"" the technical analyst said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""And if we were to draw a parallel channel, you can see that [Amazon] is moving towards the top end of the parallel channel just south of $1,200 ... It looks like we have room towards $1,160 to $1,180 here in the next one to two months""
That's another rally of as much as 5 percent for the stock, which is already up 50 percent this year.
 What's more, Gordon points out that in the last few months, a cup and handle formation has formed in charts of Amazon, which he sees as a bullish signal that the stock will move even higher.
 To take advantage of a rally in Amazon, Gordon wants to buy the December 8 weekly 1,135-strike call and pair that with the sale of the December 8 weekly 1,140-strike call for about $2.10, or $210 per options spread. This means that if Amazon were to close above $1,140 on Dec. 8 expiration, then Gordon could make a maximum profit of $290.
But if Amazon were to close below $1,135, then Gordon would lose the $210 he paid to make the trade. As a precaution, he establishes a point where he would get out of the trade.
""If the premium paid gets cut to about $1.05, let's go ahead and cut the trade,"" he said. ""The trade is probably not working.""
Amazon was trading around $1,122 on Tuesday.

 Autonomous vehicles and Amazon may be the shipping industry's buzzwords today, but blockchain is well on its way to becoming the future.
 United Parcel Service announced on Tuesday it has joined the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA), the latest logistics company taking a closer look at the platform's offerings.
""The technology has the potential to increase transparency and efficiency among shippers, carriers, brokers, consumers, vendors and other supply chain stakeholders,"" Linda Weakland, UPS director of enterprise architecture and innovation, said in a statement.
 UPS' foray into blockchain — a technology that the Chicago Fed defines as ""a network of users, each of which stores its own copy of the data"" — is not a surprise to investment group Stifel, however.
""In our view, blockchain will combine with the truckload pricing futures market, with data analytics-assisted [and] artificial intelligence-assisted real time matching of loads and empties,"" Stifel analyst John Larkin wrote in a note on Oct. 29.
Larkin said three companies will ""invest enough in technology to drive the consolidation of the industry around these core transformational technologies:"" UPS, C.H. Robinson Worldwide and XPO Logistics.

 7:41  AM ET Thu,  2 Nov 2017 |  03:38 
 The Stifel picks came after a conference call featuring Craig Fuller and Chris Burress, the founder and president of BiTA, respectively.
""The theory is that the blockchain-enabled supply chain participants will be able to handle transactions more quickly, more securely, with fewer errors and less labor cost involved in the overall process,"" Larkin said.
Consumers are among those who could benefit from the widespread adoption of blockchain technology throughout the logistics industry, Stifel said. Products would arrive more cheaply, quickly and precisely, Larkin writes, thanks to blockchain. Even software providers, data providers, and trailer-leasing companies are among those who could see greater value from day-to-day operations if the technology is implemented as theorized.
But ""there are several groups positioned to be totally or partially"" disrupted by blockchain's introduction into the trucking business, Larkin says.
""The potential losers [are those] that choose not to comply with the BiTA industry standard protocols or that choose not to be transparent,"" Larkin said.
Overall, Stifel says that ""blockchain should make transactions more efficient and reduce payment disputes but is still years away.""
UPS said it is joining BiTA as a part of its effort to build the next evolution of its logistics network. 
Shares of UPS were up 0.3 percent in midday trading Tuesday.

Pedestrians walk past a CVS Health Corp. store in Chicago.
 Investors should avoid buying CVS Health due to Amazon's competitive threat and the pharmacy chain's overly ambitious acquisitions strategy, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Jefferies reduced its price target to $76 from $86 and reaffirmed its hold rating for CVS Health shares, telling its clients to stay on the sidelines until the uncertainty passes.
Despite the report, CVS' share prices were up 1 percent Tuesday morning.
 CVS reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings Monday morning. The company also revealed a next-day and same-day prescription drug delivery service in select markets. Its stock declined 3.5 percent Monday, closing at $66.80 after the announcements.
""Based on recent trading patterns (including yday's reaction to CVS's introduction of same-day/next-day Rx delivery that some viewed as a defensive move against a supposed Amazon's entry into Rx), it is evident that overhangs related to speculation of an Aetna purchase and Amazon's supposed pharmacy plans are the more relevant drivers of [near term] stock performance,"" analyst Brian Tanquilut wrote Tuesday.
""Since it is difficult to refute either overhang, we believe investors will continue to put a discount on CVS shares until some clarity emerges on these issues.""
The company's shares have underperformed the market this year due to concerns Amazon is considering selling prescription drugs online. CVS Health stock is down 15 percent in 2017 through Monday, compared with the S&P 500's 16 percent return
Reports last month said CVS Health is in talks to buy health insurance company Aetna in potential health-care megadeal. Some analysts have speculated CVS Health may be considering the acquisition of Aetna to protect itself from potential Amazon disruption.
""They needed to defend the business from encroachment by Amazon,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill told CNBC on Oct. 26. ""Amazon's ability to impact the business over the near to mid term is low, but the ability to impact the stock is high."" CVS Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 As Kroger moves to cloud computing, the nation's largest grocery store chain is sending millions of dollars to Microsoft and Google.
 But not to Amazon.
""For obvious reasons competitively, it doesn't make sense for us to do a ton to help grow that business for them,"" Chris Hjelm, Kroger's chief information officer, told CNBC in an interview. 
 With Amazon's retail business pushing into more industries and competing more directly with a growing number of companies, Amazon Web Services is starting to experience a backlash. Kroger is joining the likes of Wal-Mart and Target in finding other vendors to handle their massive workloads for their digital and e-commerce offerings. Alphabet said in its latest earnings release that Kohl's has moved to Google's cloud.
In a blog post on Monday, venture capitalist Glenn Solomon from GGV Capital underscored how pervasive this has become. Solomon said several of his firm's portfolio companies that use AWS have been asked by retail clients to ""provide a mirrored service on another cloud because they'd prefer not to have their data stored with Amazon given competitive fears.""
For Kroger, that fear has become more obvious by the day. In August, Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion and instantly cut prices at the upscale grocer. CNBC has also been reporting on Amazon's potential efforts to crack the pharmacy market, another reason for Kroger to be concerned.

 Kroger gets about 9 percent of sales from its more than 2,200 pharmacies.
Hjelm said the company started investing heavily with Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud late last year. With Azure, the grocer is rolling out digital shelf technology to combine the use of sensors and smartphones to alert customers about relevant deals. For e-commerce, delivery and data-focused initiatives such as smart pricing, Kroger is turning to Google. The company also uses infrastructure technology from Pivotal.
Kroger does have some projects running on AWS for businesses that the company acquired. But for any new initiatives, ""that investment in growth is not going to AWS,"" Hjelm said. Regarding Microsoft and Google, ""we feel like we're not losing anything from a competitive perspective working with those companies,"" he said.
If AWS is worried about Kroger representing an emerging trend, it's not showing up in the unit's financial performance or its market share.
Revenue in third quarter surged 42 percent to $4.58 billion, and AWS produced $1.17 billion in operating income for a company that's used to running with little to no profit. Nordstrom, Under Armour, Lululemon and Nisa Retail in the U.K. are a few of the retailers and consumer brands that count on AWS.

 For cloud infrastructure as a whole, AWS controls 34 percent of the market, followed by Azure at 12 percent, IBM at 8 percent and Google at 5 percent.
According to AWS, retailers will continue to use its infrastructure because they care most about agility, security and performance when deciding where to run their workloads.
""AWS is the clear leader in these areas,"" a company spokesperson said in an e-mail. ""Retailers' end users don't care about any rivalry that may exist with another retailer.""
Like most big established enterprises, Kroger isn't moving everything to the public cloud. The company still has many of its core computing functions and storage in its own data centers. 
But Hjelm said that in the cloud, Kroger has thousands of projects for testing and development running as well as live applications. He wouldn't specify how much the company is spending on the cloud, but he said it's in the millions of dollars and is split roughly equally between Microsoft and Google.
""Over time that balance could shift depending on who creates more value,"" he said. 
Tariq Shaukat, a president in Google's cloud division, said in an interview that even if retailers have been reluctant to give Amazon their money, a lot of them have still historically run on AWS. Google is picking up customers now because its cloud platform finally has the services they need, he said.
""There's an increasing recognition that GCP is a viable option and a leader in areas they care about, like security, data analytics and machine learning,"" he said.

 CNBC First Look: Amazon Key   
 5:08  PM ET Wed,  8 Nov 2017 |  01:04 
 Amazon's new in-home delivery service, Amazon Key, is now available to Amazon Prime members in 37 cities and surrounding areas across the U.S., and we got a first look.
 To get in-home delivery, customers need an Amazon Cloud Cam and a smart lock. When the driver arrives, they verify the location by scanning the bar code on the package. Then the camera turns on and unlocks the door. Customers can watch the footage of the in-home delivery via an app on their smartphone. No codes or keys are provided to the delivery drivers.
Customers can also use the smart lock to give family and friends special codes to open the door. Amazon is soon rolling out integrations with Merry Maids and pet sitters and dog walkers on Rover.com and others via Amazon Home Services.
 The stakes are high for Amazon — bad experiences could damage Amazon's reputation and open the company up to legal and liability issues. But if it works, Amazon reduces yet another customer pain point — the need to wait around for an important delivery.

 It's no secret that Amazon is turning itself into a major physical retailer.
 Besides Whole Foods, which it bought for more than $13 billion this year, Amazon now has 13 bookstores, dozens of pop-up stores and partnerships to put products in stores run by Kohl's and Safeway.
According to The New York Times, Amazon also may open stores that sell furniture and household products.
 Why is the e-commerce giant so aggressively pushing into physical retail? Because that's where people prefer to buy most of their stuff.
Financial research firm Gordon Haskett said in a recent survey that aside from music, books, movies and small appliances, consumers showed a preference for in-store purchases.  For categories like groceries, household, and health and beauty, buying in a store was more than three times more popular than buying online.
""Despite Amazon's dominance in online traffic, the majority of purchases in several sub-categories still occurs in store,"" Gordon Haskett wrote in a note this week.
 Amazon has not shared much detail behind its retail expansion strategy. The company previously said that bookstores provide another way for the company to showcase its hardware devices like the Echo.
Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said during last month's earnings call that physical retail is here to stay.
""You will see more expansion from us,"" Olsavsky said during the call. ""It's still early, so those plans will develop over time.""

 });Amazon Web Services caught many established tech giants sleeping as it boomed to a $20-billion-a-year business, and now it's making a move to dominate a new cloud market: the Middle East. Amazon recently announced it will be investing in its first Mideast data centers, based in Bahrain, which the company said will be built by 2019.
 Amazon Web Services continues to be a major source of revenue, growing 42 percent in the just-reported third quarter, with a top-line contribution of $4.6 billion. But there are signs that the rest of the tech world is catching up to Amazon in the cloud: The AWS results marked the ninth-consecutive quarter of a declining trend in AWS revenue growth(Q3 was actually flat compared to Q2), making new markets more important to Amazon's investment in the cloud.

 ""The Middle East is a bit of a dead zone when it comes to cloud computing,"" said John Dinsdale, chief analyst and managing director of Synergy Research Group. ""Will this change? Yes, but slowly."" He added, ""Any firm that wants to be a serious global cloud provider cannot afford to just ignore the Middle East.""
 An Amazon spokesman said the company would not go into details about plans for AWS in the Middle East but added that the company is ""far from being done adding [cloud computing data centers] in this part of the world.""
Amazon Web Services has benefited from the cloud computing boom of the past decade, which allows companies to outsource many IT functions to large, off-site data centers. AWS accounted for 10 percent of Amazon's total revenue in the third quarter, and operating income of $1.17 billion compared to operating profit of just $347 million for Amazon as a whole. AWS is on pace for annual revenue over $15 billion.
But U.S. competitors, including Microsoft Azure and Oracle, are coming hard after Amazon in the cloud — where it has achieved as high as double the market share of any other player, 30 percent, according to one 2017 estimate. International tech players are pushing into cloud services, too,  including Alibaba Cloud. Alibaba already has a data center in Dubai, and Oracle has planned a center to serve the United Arab Emirates.
""That's one of the gaps in coverage,"" said Santhosh Rao of tech consulting firm Gartner. ""The Middle East is one obvious region that (Amazon) hadn't addressed.""
There are more than 370 data centers in the world, but most of these are in the United States, Western Europe and East Asia, according to Synergy Research Group.
At least in Saudi Arabia, Chinese tech companies like Alibaba and Tencent are poised to dominate the cloud market. But Rao said this is not necessarily the case in the larger region and that it's too early to tell how Saudi Arabia and Dubai will react to the data centers in Bahrain.
""They just set up shop,"" Rao said. ""We'll have to wait and see how it plays out in the long run.""
 Mideast start-ups stand to benefit from cloud boom
 Bringing cloud services to the Middle East dovetails with the broader business trends in the region, where Internet-based businesses and start-ups are booming. Earlier this year, Amazon acquired the Middle East's largest online marketplace, Souq.com, that serves seven countries and boasts 45 million website visits per month. 
Souq.com was founded by a Northwestern University–educated Syrian entrepreneur, Ronaldo Mouchawar. It has been reported that Amazon offered $650 million before there was an $800 million bid from United Arab Emirates-based Emaar Properties, the owner of the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Amazon prevailed in the acquisition nonetheless.
Souq.com, often called the Amazon of the Middle East, is emblematic of the success of a small but growing start-up scene in the Gulf countries.
""Candidly, like most Americans, I didn't know this was going on in the Arab World,"" said Chris Schroeder, who in 2013 published Startup Rising: The Entrepreneurial Revolution Remaking the Middle East"" in 2013. ""People are often surprised that there's incredible talent and an incredible tech ecosystem (in the Middle East).""

Countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE and Bahrain are poised for start-up investment because of rising middle-class segments of their societies and increasing access to technology.
""We are working to quickly integrate Souq and Amazon capabilities to provide an exceptional shopping experience for customers in the Middle East,"" said a spokesperson for Souq.com via email.
Schroeder said the Souq.com acquisition may have a ripple effect on other start-ups by showing that lucrative exits are possible in the Middle East. ""It's inspiring to them,"" he said.

 For companies like Fetchr, a Dubai-based start-up that offers consumer and business-to-consumer courier services, the basic cloud computing services already offered have been vital to the expansion of the company. It recently expanded to Jordan and also has operations in the UAE, Egypt, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Oman. Fetchr and other start-ups stand to gain access to a much wider network of services, along with increased speed and capability in data-sharing as the cloud evolves in the region.
""You've practically got supercomputer power at the tips of your fingers,"" said Junaid Qureshi, vice president of technology at Fetchr. ""I think it's going to be a game changer.""
 Bahrain's start-up scene
 Amazon's decision to set up their first center in Bahrain sidesteps Dubai, which has received attention as a promising global hub for start-ups and is where Alibaba's cloud operations are based. But Megha Kumar, research director of software at IDC for the Middle East and Africa, said these tech giants can reach many businesses in the region once they set up cloud services in one of the Gulf countries.
Bahrain's bustling start-up scene may have factored into Amazon's decision. Bahrain has a number of programs that support the start-up economy, including a labor fund called Tamkeen and the Economic Development Board of Bahrain, which help to mentor business and start-up owners.
At a recent investment conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain's Commerce Minister H. E. Zayed bin Rashid Al Zayani said that the oil-rich state — like the rest of the GCC — has taken steps to diversify its economy. ""We're moving Bahrain to a digital economy,"" Al Zayani said. ""We're moving into the next frontier.

 });2017 has been loaded with excellent gadgets ranging from exciting new smartphones to smart speakers and home security products.Fortunately, as CNBC's in-house technology product editor — and someone who has spent his entire career testing gadgets — I was able to call in and test dozens of new products that launched this year. That meant taking some home, installing them and seeing which ones worked better than others.In some cases, I picked new versions of what was already the best product on the market, and tested to see if it succeeded beyond the original. Other times, I tested products that were so bad they didn't even make it to the site.The following are, I think, the best gadgets for gifts this holiday season, and one is easily the best I tested all year. I've even purchased many of them for myself -- enough times that my wife shudders every time a new package arrives at the house, which should say something.Here's what deserves to get wrapped this year:The original Bose Quiet Comfort 35 headphones never leave my travel bag and, this year, Bose updated that model with new support for Google Assistant.

There's even a standard three-prong power port and plenty of laptop adapters in the box. I love its small OLED display that shows how much juice is left, and that it recharges quicker than most power packs this size.

The new $149 model is no frills, but works well with the August App. You can unlock or lock the door from your smartphone, so long as you're standing near it, and even add preapproved users — like friends coming for the weekend or a cleaning person — so that you don't need to hand out a physical version of your key. I recommend pairing it with the August Doorbell camera, coming up next.Price: $149Buy now: August Smart LockThe August Doorbell Camera is a perfect accessory to the August Smart Lock.

No more digging through Bluetooth menus.Plus, they work with the new Apple Watch Series 3 for streaming audio without your smartphone, give you quick access to Siri and sound pretty darn good for the price. They also have a stellar battery life with a case that helps them stay juiced. I don't leave home without them.. though I'm still getting used to wearing them out in public.Price: $159Buy now: Apple AirPodsThe Apple Watch Series 3 is the best smartwatch on the market, hands down. I prefer the connected LTE model, which allows me to place phone calls and stream music even when I'm not near my phone.The GPS-only model is still great, though, and lets you answer and receive calls, notifications and more, so long as your iPhone is nearby. Don't own an iPhone? Check out the Samsung Gear Sport — it's my favorite option for Android devices.Price: $329 and upBuy now: Apple Watch Series 3The iPad Pro 10.5 was so impressive that I ended up selling my iPad Pro 9.7 and buying the new model. I love the large display in a form factor that isn't too cumbersome to toss into my backpack.Also, with the $99 Apple Pencil, I can use it for jotting notes during meetings. iOS 11, Apple's new operating system, also improves multitasking so you can do even more with the iPad, like running multiple apps side by side.Price: $649 and upBuy now: Apple iPad Pro 10.5Microsoft's Surface Pro has grown on me over the last several months. I own a bulky Windows 10 laptop that's chock full of hardware, but I turn to the Surface Pro when I need something light, still powerful enough for photo editing, and that's easy to work on.It has a large and sharp display and supports pen input for jotting notes on the display. Just make sure you're buying at least the Core i5 edition ($999), which adds a bit more power, and the must-have $159 keyboard.Price: $799 without a keyboard; we recommend buying the $999 modelBuy from: Microsoft Surface ProI fell in love with the Fire HD 8, strangely enough, while reviewing the larger 10-inch model. The HD 8 costs just $80 and offers a portal into Amazon's ecosystem of movies, music, TV shows and more. It even has Alexa built in, so you can hold the home button and control your lights or ask any question that comes to mind.It looks and feels cheap (because it is) but it's a great budget option for folks who want a tablet but don't want to break the bank. Want something larger? Get the 10-inch model.Price: $80Buy now: Amazon Fire HD 8You're either in Amazon's ecosystem or you're not. If you fall in the latter camp, the Google Home is a must have smart speaker. Like the Echo, it can be configured to play music around your house, call phone numbers, answer queries (how far is it to Idaho?) and even play TV shows and movies on any TV with a Google Chromecast installed. Google also sells a mini version of the Home that's cheaper, but we haven't tested its quality yet.Price: $129Buy now: Google HomeI've been buying Philips Hue smart bulbs since smart bulbs became a thing a few years back. You can use them to turn the lights on and off by voice (with a smart home speaker like the Echo or Google Home, or your smartphone.) Some bulbs even have millions of colors, in case you want to set some mood lighting.Hue bulbs work with the most ecosystems in my experience, and have been the most reliable of any smart bulbs I've owned. Check out a starter kit with a Hue Hub included, or set them up one by one with an all-in-one hub like the Amazon Echo Plus.Price: $99 and upBuy now: Philips Hue light bulbsThe August Smart Lock is my favorite smart lock of the year. The new $149 model is no frills, but works well with the August App. You can unlock or lock the door from your smartphone, so long as you're standing near it, and even add preapproved users — like friends coming for the weekend or a cleaning person — so that you don't need to hand out a physical version of your key. I recommend pairing it with the August Doorbell camera, coming up next.Price: $149Buy now: August Smart LockThe August Doorbell Camera is a perfect accessory to the August Smart Lock. Combined, they're two of my favorite gadgets to launch this year. The Doorbell Camera alerts you when someone's at your door, allowing you to pull up a live video feed. Or, if you miss the alert, you can get a quick snapshot of who stopped by. With the Smart Lock installed too, you can unlock or lock the door depending on who's knocking.Price: $199Buy now: August Doorbell CameraIf you're not in the iPhone camp and still want a really great smartphone, check out the Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8 Plus. You'll find an almost unreal display that seems to pour over the edges of the phone, support for Samsung Gear VR out of the box, expandable storage, first-class cameras, wireless charging and more. If you have a bit more dough to spend, check out the Galaxy Note 8, which adds an S Pen for jotting notes and an even larger display.Price: $725Buy now: Samsung Galaxy S8The iPhone X is the best smartphone I've ever tested and I highly recommend it for anyone who needs a new smartphone this season. In fact, it's the best gadget of the year. It features new functions like Face ID, which lets you unlock the phone by looking at it, to first-class front- and rear-facing cameras that take professional-looking photos. Wireless charging, a gorgeous and colorful OLED display and stereo front-facing speakers round out the features of the best smartphone of the year.Price: $999 and upBuy now:  The iPhone X 2017 has been loaded with excellent gadgets ranging from exciting new smartphones to smart speakers and home security products.Fortunately, as CNBC's in-house technology product editor — and someone who has spent his entire career testing gadgets — I was able to call in and test dozens of new products that launched this year. That meant taking some home, installing them and seeing which ones worked better than others.In some cases, I picked new versions of what was already the best product on the market, and tested to see if it succeeded beyond the original. Other times, I tested products that were so bad they didn't even make it to the site.The following are, I think, the best gadgets for gifts this holiday season, and one is easily the best I tested all year. I've even purchased many of them for myself -- enough times that my wife shudders every time a new package arrives at the house, which should say something.Here's what deserves to get wrapped this year:2017 has been loaded with excellent gadgets ranging from exciting new smartphones to smart speakers and home security products.Fortunately, as CNBC's in-house technology product editor — and someone who has spent his entire career testing gadgets — I was able to call in and test dozens of new products that launched this year.

That means you can tap a button and pull up Google to answer any question you might have, or even to play specific music right on your phone.

I love its small OLED display that shows how much juice is left, and that it recharges quicker than most power packs this size.

 Amazon to bring pop-up shops to Whole Foods stores for the holidays   
 1:16  PM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  00:49 
 Whole Foods stores are about to get cozier with Amazon.
 A handful of Amazon-branded pop-up stores will be rolling out at select Whole Foods locations for the holidays. The Amazon-staffed centers will launch in mid-November, at stores in Illinois, Michigan, Florida, California and Colorado, according to Whole Foods. There, shoppers will be able to try Amazon devices before they buy them, also learning about Amazon services and Prime memberships.The grocery chain announced Thursday that currently more than 100 Whole Foods stores carry Amazon devices, such as the Echo, Echo Dot, Fire TV, Kindle e-readers and Fire tablets.
Gearing up for the holiday season, Whole Foods is also rolling out Black Friday deals on Amazon's merchandise, starting the week leading up to Thanksgiving.
 Those deals include $20 off the Echo Dot, $20 off the new Amazon Echo, $30 off the new Echo Plus and $30 off Fire HD 8 tablet.
Amazon completed its acquisition of Whole Foods in August, immediately slashing prices on a variety of products across the grocer's stores. Thursday's announcement validates that the internet giant will continue to leverage Whole Foods' stores to its advantage.
Amazon has promised ""more to come,"" as the company begins to integrate its Prime program into the Whole Foods ecosystem. Eventually, Prime members will receive ""special savings and in-store benefits,"" Amazon said in August.
Whole Foods stores have also been outfitted with Amazon lockers, where customers can pick up online orders, and Whole Foods stores can process Amazon returns.

 Bezos says the key mindset is thinking long-term, which requires patience. He says he's used this approach repeatedly at Amazon.
""What we're really focused on is thinking long-term, putting the customer at the center of our universe and inventing,"" Bezos says in an interview with Four Peaks TV. ""Those are the three big ideas to think long-term because a lot of invention doesn't work.""
 When you're first creating something, whether it's a new business or a product, you have to invent, says Bezos. ""If you're going to invent, it means you're going to experiment, and you'll have to think long-term,"" he adds.
It can admittedly be difficult to think long-term and stay the course without panicking when things don't go your way. Bezos offers this advice: Be straightforward and clear about how you're going to operate and what you want to get done from the beginning.

 });
 Bezos says you should also stick to your guns. ""[At Amazon] we don't even take a position on whether our way is the right way,"" he says, ""we just claim it's our way.""

 Most importantly, says the billionaire, don't kid yourself. ""[Warren Buffett] says you can hold a ballet and that can be successful. And you can hold a rock concert and that can be successful. Just don't hold a ballet and advertise it as a rock concert.""
Bezos adds that you must be clear not only with yourself, but also with those around you. That way, he says, they can ""self-select in.""
Bezos emphasizes the importance of looking ahead but also realizing that everything takes time. The billionaire says that when a new business reaches a milestone at Amazon, no matter how small, there are congratulatory messages sent to the company's employees.
""Big things start small. The biggest oak starts from an acorn,"" says Bezos. ""You've got to be willing to let that acorn grow into a little sapling, and then finally into a small tree and then maybe one day it'll be a big business on its own.""
Bezos explains that his motto is gradatim ferociter, which is Latin for ""step-by-step courageously.""
""You can't skip steps. You have to put one foot in front of the other. Things take time. There are no shortcuts,"" he says. ""But you want to do those steps with passion and ferocity.""

Mark Cuban
 Billionaire investor Mark Cuban said Thursday that his biggest holding is in e-commerce giant Amazon followed by the streaming titan Netflix.
 ""Just because of their growth,"" Cuban said at The New York Times DealBook Conference. ""I've had them for a long time. I don't switch things around. I don't move it around a lot."" 
Amazon, which has been disrupting several industries recently, is up more than 48 percent this year, according to FactSet. Netflix has risen more than 50 percent this year, and last month said it added 5.3 million net subscribers in its past quarter.
 Cuban has previously proclaimed his fondness for Amazon before. In an interview with CNBC earlier this year, he said he thinks the online retail giant ""is the greatest company in the world.""
When asked about other investments he's made, Cuban said, ""cash, Treasurys, municipalities ... stuff that I've had forever"" and private companies ""because I really try to support entrepreneurs."" 
""I'm the luckiest guy in the world,"" Cuban added. ""All I got to do is not f--- it up.""

 CVS-Aetna deal 'really smart' way to ward off Amazon   
 2:50  PM ET Mon, 13 Nov 2017 |  00:55 
 CVS Health's bid to acquire health insurer Aetna is a ""really smart"" way of staving off competition from Amazon.com, according to one Wall Street analyst.
 Needham upgraded shares of CVS to a buy rating and bumped its price target on the retail pharmacy, praising the company's proactive actions as competition from e-commerce giant Amazon looms.
""The next month may shape the outlook and direction for CVS for the next 10 years,"" wrote Needham analyst Kevin Caliendo in a note to clients. ""Even in the face of an impending competitive entry in pharmacy by Amazon, we find the risk-reward on the stock favorable, especially if CVS is able to consummate the reported merger with Aetna.""
 The analyst increased his price target on the company to $79, which represents 14 percent upside from Thursday's close. Caliendo believes a new CVS-Aetna could ""easily"" grow earnings 10 percent annually down the road, given no hiccups in pharmacy benefit management during integration or lost share to Amazon.
Shares of CVS Health closed nearly 3 percent higher Friday.
The reported $66 billion deal between CVS and Aetna would be the largest in health insurance history. The move is viewed by many on the Street as a strategic play to bolster the defenses of both companies against a potential move by Amazon into the industry.
The $544 billion e-commerce giant Amazon has been quietly exploring ways to expand into the pharmaceutical industry. Jeff Bezos' company has also contributed to the struggles of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like CVS.
CVS announced this month that it plans to bring prescriptions ""right to customers' doors"" with next-day delivery starting in 2018, akin to Amazon's competitive shipping method for Prime members.
The company also announced late last month that it would be partnering with Walgreens Boots Alliance in starting the 30,000-store network in an attempt to reduce costs both for the company and for pharmacy benefit management (PBM) members.
""We do think CVS announcing its agreement with Walgreens to create a 30,000 store national network with 10,000 to be named independent pharmacies is a direct land-share grab to limit Amazon's potential partnering options,"" added Caliendo.
""And the more recent announcement that CVS will provide next day fulfillment to individuals is clearly a service that would compete with Amazon.""

A registered nurse hangs an I.V. bag for a patient at the University of Miami Hospital's Emergency Department.
 JPMorgan health care expert Lisa Gill shared her views on the impact Amazon is having on the pharmaceutical space in an exclusive interview 
 with CNBC PRO's 
 Mike Santoli.
 ""That's all anybody wants to talk about – I think myself, every sell-side shop has put out something with their thoughts around this,"" said Gill. ""We would not be surprised if they get into mail order pharmacy around prescriptions.""
Gill is managing director of U.S. healthcare technology at JPMorgan, where she's been a member of the health care team since 1998. Her coverage includes health care distribution, pharmacy benefit managers and drug retail. Prior to her work at JPMorgan, she was part of an audit group specializing in health care facilities at Ernst & Young.
 And while she told CNBC she wouldn't be surprised to see Amazon enter the health care space, Gill argued that its impact on traditional retailers may not be what most expect.
""A pharmacist has to oversee the facility; when they pour the pills into the cylinder to fill the prescription, only a pharmacy tech can do that,"" she explained. ""So that's a different type of workforce, a much more expensive workforce because they're pharmacy techs and pharmacists.""
Amazon, which regularly sends fears racing through the retail space, has specialized in delivering consumer products both at reduced prices and with fast delivery. But health care's comparatively strict regulation may be too burdensome for the e-commerce giant to make a meaningful impact.
Drugs, unlike most goods Amazon sells, cannot be shipped together with other products.
""Wal-Mart got into this business with a $4 generic back in 2006, took a lot of market cap out of the drug retailers at that point like Amazon is doing today,"" Gill added. ""They ultimately got into mail order in 2007-2008 and had 4,000 locations to pick up a prescription, but yet we don't really think of them as being that disruptive.""

A worker packs customer orders at the Amazon fulfillment center in Romeoville, Illinois.
 Amazon could face $28,000 in potential fines after an inspection by the state of Indiana found potential workplace safety violations at a warehouse where a 59-year-old worker was killed in late September.
The Associated Press reported that the victim, Phillip Terry of Indianapolis, ""was fatally crushed when a forklift's lift fell on him while he was doing maintenance work on it."" Terry was killed on Sept. 24 at an Amazon facility in the Indianapolis suburb of Plainfield.
In a nine-page letter to Amazon, the Indiana Department of Labor outlined four violations that could carry fines of $7,000 each. They included a failure to ""provide adequate training"" and to develop and document certain safety procedures. Amazon can appeal the penalties.

Also in September, a 28-year-old worker named Devan Shoemaker was killed at an Amazon warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Shoemaker was accidentally crushed by a truck near the facility's loading docks on Sept. 19, according to a local news report. Another Amazon worker was killed in an accident at the same facility in 2014.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is still investigating Shoemaker's death, a spokeswoman said.
Amazon has come under fire in recent years for how physically taxing some of its warehouse jobs can be. The company's warehouse workers aren't unionized. A 2014 union drive at one of its Delaware facilities failed.
As Amazon's retail business continues its rapid growth, the company has been furiously building out its warehouse footprint and hiring for these facilities to try to keep up with consumer demand.
Behind the magic of the Amazon Buy button, an army of warehouse workers do the hard work that make it possible.

 Amazon may reach the $1 trillion market value milestone in the next year, according to a top Wall Street firm.
 Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight rating for Amazon shares, presenting a ""bull case"" 12-month price target of $2,000 per share or roughly a $1 trillion market cap.
""Amazon's high margin [revenue] disclosure speaks to the $1trln ($2,000/sh) sum of parts bull case,"" analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients Sunday entitled ""The Math Behind the Trillion Dollar Bull Case.""
 ""Our sum of the parts methodology looks out to 2022 for the 5 various segments (1P, 3P, AWS, Subscription, and Advertising/Other) and applies multiples based on what we view are appropriate peer groups, factoring in relative growth rates and margin profiles. We discount each segment back to year-end 2018 to arrive at a $2,000/share value or ~$1 trillion bull case.""
Nowak shared his valuation methodology and key forecasts for each of Amazon's businesses to reach the $2,000 share price target.
The analyst valued Amazon's core retail business at $600 billion, estimating 13 percent annual sales growth for its e-commerce business in 2022 and a 5.5 percent operating profit margin that year. He also estimates its third-party marketplace business will achieve a 25 percent earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) profit margin in five years.
Nowak gives a $270 billion valuation for Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing arm, forecasting 18 percent annual sales growth and a 50 percent EBITDA margin in year 2022. He also assigns a $70 billion value to the company's growing subscription business and $55 billion for its advertising segment.
Even as he outlined the positive optimistic scenario, the analyst reiterated his $1,250 price target for Amazon shares, representing 11 percent upside to Friday's close.
Amazon shares have rallied 50 percent year to date through Friday, compared with the S&P 500's 15 percent return.

Cargo aircrafts from UPS, FedEx and West Air Europe are parked at Cargo City at Arlanda airport in Stockholm.
 United Parcel Services and FedEx could see as much as 50 percent earnings upside thanks to accelerating global trade, according to Goldman Sachs.
 Analysts at Goldman initiated coverage on UPS and FedEx with  buy ratings, citing a strong international outlook and overblown worries about Amazon's foray into airfreight and logistics.
""We think the market is overlooking acceleration in global trade,"" analyst Matt Reustle wrote in Monday's note to clients. ""Concerns about margins and what impact Amazon may have on the airfreight and logistics industries are overstated and point to dependency on the US Postal Service and the $125 billion capex hurdle we think it would cost to compete in airfreight and logistics on a global scale.""
 ""Lost in the shuffle of 'e-commerce'"" has been growth in UPS' export business and strength in FedEx's international business, according to Reustle. He said that although more than 95 percent of residential deliveries in the U.S. are made by the Postal Service, UPS and FedEx, the companies should benefit from growth abroad.
The Goldman analyst cites UPS' $2 billion investment in its international network as evidence for its buy rating and optimism abroad.
But while UPS may see upside abroad, shares tumbled last month after reports that Amazon is experimenting with a new delivery service hit the Street.
 Bloomberg reported that Amazon's new service would be aimed at making more items available for free two-day shipping. It would also relieve overcrowding in the company's warehouses.
Shares of UPS and FedEx fell after the news in October.
UPS also made headlines in domestic markets after making an unprecedented move for the holidays, announcing it will charge extra during peak shipping weeks in November and December. Citi Research said the move suggests UPS ""is in the process of accelerating"" its business, and raised its forecast for the company's stock in August.
Reustle established a $148 price target on UPS, representing 31 percent upside from Friday's close. Shares closed up 1.4 percent on Monday.
As for FedEx, the analyst also sees significant upside over the next 12 months as the company recovers from a major cyberattack on its new European subsidiary TNT Express.
FedEx announced in June that TNT was attacked, disrupting operations and communications. While the company said that no data had been breached, some Wall Street firms grew skeptical that the hack would leave FexEx strapped for volume. But with the holiday season fast approaching, those concerns may take a backseat to speedy deliveries.
""We believe that the upcoming peak season and ongoing restoration of the TNT systems are catalysts for FDX shares,"" wrote the analyst. ""While fiscal year 2018 likely carries noise from TNT integration, we estimate FedEx will meet its more than 10 percent earnings per share growth and 10 percent or more operating margins in fiscal year 2019.
The analyst's $270 price target on FedEx represents 24 percent upside from Friday's close. Shares closed up 1.5 percent on Monday.

 Amazon won't use licenses to sell prescription drugs   
 3:52  PM ET Mon, 13 Nov 2017 |  00:39 
 Amazon will not use pharmacy licenses it obtained from Tennessee and Indiana to sell prescriptions, but will use them to sell medical devices and supplies instead, the company has told regulators.
 Amazon has kept mum about its ambitions in health care, despite reports that it's exploring getting into the prescription drug business. But it has been quietly talking to regulators. 
Analysts from the investment firm Jefferies uncovered correspondence between the company and regulators in Tennessee and Indiana. Excerpts from these documents, which Jefferies obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request, show that Amazon intends to sell medical devices and supplies in its Indiana fulfillment center, but would not be storing or distributing prescription drugs. 
 ""Applicant (Amazon) will not store or ship drugs,"" the application clearly states. 
That said, most industry experts aren't ruling out the possibility of Amazon entering the prescription drug market. Instead, they maintain that it's a matter of if, not when. 
""There has been a massive overreaction to the Amazon threat,"" said Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting and a drug supply chain expert, to CNBC. 
""I would never underestimate Amazon,"" he continued. ""But I remain somewhat skeptical of Amazon's ability and desire to fundamentally alter the drug channel (as) the incumbents will have many opportunities to defend their position, capture value from internet technologies, and streamline distribution.""
Jefferies analysts stress that Amazon could navigate the complexities of the prescription drug space, but that it will be likely to disrupt some lower-hanging fruit first. And that includes selling medical supplies, such as surgical equipment and devices. That would be a more immediate threat to medical distribution companies, like McKesson and Cardinal Health, rather than to pharmacies and pharmacy benefits managers. 
Amazon is expected to make a decision about whether it will get into the prescription drug business in the coming weeks.

 Walmart.com to partner with Lord & Taylor   
 7:58  PM ET Mon, 13 Nov 2017 |  05:43 
 Wal-Mart is creating a home for luxury fashion online.
 The big-box retailer announced Monday it has partnered with Lord & Taylor to create an online ""flagship store"" for the apparel retailer. The landing page will launch on Walmart.com in spring 2018.
""Our goal is to create a premium fashion destination on Walmart.com,"" Denise Incandela, head of fashion for Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce division, said in a statement. ""We see customers on our site searching for higher-end items, and we are expanding our business online to focus on adding specialized and premium shopping experience, starting with fashion.""
 Incandela previously worked as chief marketing officer for Saks Fifth Avenue, which, like Lord & Taylor, is part of Hudson's Bay. She just moved to Wal-Mart in October and is responsible for the company's fashion business across Walmart.com, Jet.com and Shoes.com.
Through this partnership, Walmart.com will provide Lord & Taylor dedicated space on its website, as the department store chain continues to operate its own e-commerce platform.
""Walmart.com is a shopping destination that reaches a wide base of customers looking for premium fashion brands,"" Lord & Taylor President Liz Rodbell said in a statement. ""As retail continues to change, this flagship store creates enormous growth opportunities for Lord & Taylor and our brand partners.""
It was rumored in October that this deal would come to fruition.
The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that this was part of Wal-Mart's broader effort to build a shopping destination online that rivaled that of Amazon.com.
The Arkansas-based retailer's strategy of late has been to acquire smaller brands, many of them with a focus on fashion. The list of apparel and accessories brands now owned by Wal-Mart includes Bonobos, Modcloth, Shoebuy and Moosejaw. In a move to beef up its grocery offering, Wal-Mart also acquired Jet.com, bringing Quidsi co-founder Marc Lore to its management team.
Lore has specifically said he wants to ""elevate the Walmart.com brands."" At a recent investor day, he also explained that Wal-Mart has plans to redesign its website, with a focus on household goods and fashion.
""Expect to see those experiences get elevated,"" Lore said about Wal-Mart's home and fashion departments.
Wal-Mart said Monday it's beginning to build out ""elements of discovery and inspiration"" within the fashion portion of its website. The company declined to comment on whether there will be more brand partnerships in the future.
In working with Lord & Taylor, Wal-Mart could begin to shift Walmart.com's image away from that of a discount site for consumer packaged goods and into that of an online platform with luxury brands.
Meantime, Lord & Taylor has problems of its own, met with declining sales and weaker foot traffic. In a bid for fresh capital, the retailer recently announced that its flagship store on Fifth Avenue will soon become the new global headquarters of WeWork. After the holidays, Lord & Taylor will occupy only a small portion of the building.
A Wal-Mart partnership could entice more shoppers — and new ones at that — to the department store chain's brands.
The two companies have yet to reveal which retailer will be shipping purchased items. But the Journal reported in October that — in the event of a deal — Lord & Taylor would own the inventory and fulfill orders from the new website.
Monday's announcement comes as Amazon has been making its own push into fashion. One example of this is Prime Wardrobe. The internet giant also recently unveiled two private-label athletic apparel brands, as it continues to lure top brands, such as Nike, to sell directly from Amazon.com.
Earlier this year, Amazon began working with department store chain Kohl's to sell some of its electronics in the retailer's stores. In turn, analysts are already predicting Kohl's locations will be a testing ground for Amazon's private-label apparel business.
Kohl's and Amazon declined to comment on future initiatives.
All things considered, competition is only intensifying within the industry. Wal-Mart is also reportedly raising prices on some items across its website, in a move to drive store traffic where Amazon doesn't operate, the Journal reported Sunday.  
Wal-Mart is set to report third-quarter earnings before the bell on Thursday.

A wax version of Gollum from 'The Lord of the Rings' sits on display at the Comic-Con International Convention being held at the San Diego Convention Center.
 The newest TV installment from Middle Earth is headed to Amazon.
 Amazon Studios — in conjunction with the Tolkien Estate and Trust, HarperCollins and New Line Cinema — will produce a new ""The Lord of the Rings"" TV series, the company announced Monday. Amazon acquired multiseason, global television rights to the project. The show will be available for Amazon Prime members. 
The series will be a prequel to the J.R.R. Tolkien book ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" and is based on new story lines. There is also potential for spinoffs. The financial terms and series release timing were not disclosed, although a Deadline report said Amazon paid close to $250 million just for the rights without any production costs. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the price. 
 The race for acquisition of premium franchises is tightening, as more tech companies and streaming platforms acquire content.
Netflix has had a long-standing relationship with Marvel, and acquired comic book company Millarworld in August. (Though Disney is pulling its Marvel movies off Netflix in 2019, the joint Netflix-Marvel TV show productions will remain.) Meanwhile, earlier reports said Amazon and Apple were bidding for the ""James Bond"" franchise, along with traditional entertainment companies.

 Wal-Mart to charge higher prices on its website than in stores   
 4:31  PM ET Mon, 13 Nov 2017 |  02:30 
 Wal-Mart raising prices online shows how the retailer is different from Amazon, strategists say. 
 Wal-Mart has started making some items more expensive online than in stores to try to drive people into stores, The Wall Street Journal reports. The strategy could help the retailer stop losing money on sales that weren't profitable in the first place, said Avery Sheffield, Brandywine Global portfolio manager. 
That's the tension between the two, Pro4ma founder and CEO Liz Dunn said: Amazon is focused on topline growth, and Wal-Mart needs to make money. 
 ""I think Amazon will continue to take market share because they are kind of playing by their own rules and I think that digital will continue to take market share from stores. Amazon will get an outsize portion of that share, and I think Wal-Mart needs to make money,"" Dunn said on ""Closing Bell."" 
Wal-Mart displays online prices and in-store prices for some items on its website and gives customers the option to shop online and pick up in-store with the less expensive price. That online sticker shock may actually help boost Wal-Mart's image when customers go into stores and see how much cheaper prices are, Sheffield said.

An F-35A conducts testing with a short-range air-to-missle flying over the skies of California.
 Amazon may not sell real tanks or fighter jets, but the Pentagon could soon be looking to buy other items in bulk from the e-commerce giant, according to a pending bill.
 The bill, formally known as the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, is part of an annual measure that sets defense policy and authorizes spending on particular defense programs. The final version of the NDAA was announced last week in a House-Senate conference report, and the House is set to vote as early as Tuesday on the legislation.
""The fiscal year 2018 NDAA conference report has something for everyone,"" Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu said in a research note.
 She said Lockheed Martin looks like ""the biggest winner,"" noting that funding levels for the F-35 stealth fighter are more than $2 billion above the administration's request. There's a total of 90 F-35 fighters that the NDAA conference report provides for, up from the 70 aircraft requested by the White House.
But it's the acquisition provision in the NDAA that allows the Department of Defense to buy ""commercially available off-the-shelf items"" from online marketplaces that is especially interesting and could be far reaching since the Pentagon buys not just high-priced weapon systems but ordinary goods such as office supplies.
""The Pentagon is one of the largest organizations in the world,"" said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. ""If you look at it, they employ like 2.2 million people full time and another 800,000 part time. It's a big organization with a lot of bases and office space, so there's there's a lot of these mundane purchases of pencils and whatever.""
The reform is designed to ""improve the way the Pentagon buys commercial off-the-shelf goods, ranging from bottled water to treadmills or even forklifts,"" according to the NDAA summary report prepared by the House Armed Services Committee. It said the DoD has two options today for purchases, through the contracting process or from the General Services Administration.
Under the change, the government would be allowed ""to use online commercial sites such as Amazon, Grainger, Staples, or Walmart just as businesses do,"" the NDAA summary stated. ""These portals function like mini-marketplaces, ensuring that the buyer gets the best price without a lot of red tape.""
""It could be very significant over a number of years,"" said Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst at Cowen. ""Just initially there's going to be sort of a learning process. Also, the government is going to have to set up the rules of the road and set up some thresholds and procedures on how to do it.""
The federal government's independent GSA would have a prominent role in helping to create the ground rules for the DoD's program to buy from online marketplaces.
""I'm curious to see how this will actually work in practice,"" said Dan Grazier, a defense industry expert at the Project On Government Oversight, a Washington watchdog group. ""There's been all kinds of issues over the years with people abusing the government charge cards, which is exactly how this system will be used."" 
The NDAA also contains other acquisition reform provisions, including to give the Pentagon better oversight and understanding of their service contracts, which includes everything from base maintenance such as painting buildings, mowing laws and other support areas. The NDAA is more of a policy bill for national defense priorities and programs but not an appropriations bill.
Slightly more than half of the Pentagon's annual contract obligations are for what's categorized as contracted services, which includes facility, construction, R&D, transportation, logistics and other services.
Meantime, besides Lockheed's F-35 being a beneficiary of the NDAA there's good news in the legislation for Boeing. The bill authorizes the procurement of more of the company's F/A-18 fighters, V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and Chinook CH-47 helicopters than the administration had asked for in its May budget.
Kahyaoglu also said the NDAA includes ""broad support across ships."" Specifically, the bill authorizes just over $26 billion for shipbuilding to fund 14 ships, some $6.3 billion above the president's request or 5 more battle force ships.
The Senate could vote on the NDAA before Thanksgiving holiday but no vote is imminent, according to a congressional source. Once the conference version is approved by both chambers it can go to the president for consideration.
Overall, the NDAA includes $692 billion in defense spending, which includes around $66 billion for the so-called Overseas Contingency Operations warfighting fund and a base budget of $626 billion, as well as $8 billion for other defense activities. But the base discretionary spending amount exceeds the $549 billion allowed under the current budget caps.
""Not only is it well in excess of the budget caps, it's in excess of what the president submitted in his budget request,"" said CSIS's Harrison.
Getting rid of the budget caps will require at least 60 votes in the GOP-controlled Senate, or support of every Republican and eight Democratic senators.
Another hurdle to still overcome is getting Congress to agree on a appropriations bill to fund the fiscal 2018 defense spending. There's a chance the appropriations could end up at a lower level than the NDAA's total of $700 billion.
""You can authorize whatever level of funding you want in the NDAA,"" said Harrison. ""You still have to wait on appropriations to come, and that can end up at a very different level of funding. And they are not making any progress on the appropriations right now.""

 These drones can save lives with quick medical deliveries   
 4:04  PM ET Wed, 15 Nov 2017 |  01:08 
 Delivering medical supplies into the heart of the Amazonian rainforest is no easy feat. So a group within BD, a medical technology manufacturer, is testing whether drones will do the trick.
 The company worked with WeRobotics, an international NGO that promotes the use of drones for social good around the world, and UAV del Peru, a local affiliate. for its first set of field tests. At the Exponential Medicine conference in San Diego, California, last week, the groups showed off their solution, which includes a special pouch for diagnostic tests, blood collection kits and other supplies, that fits neatly into the drone.
Juan Bergelund, a manager of UAV del Peru, said the drones are designed to land in soccer fields. And that the company is training locals on the ground about the technology, so they understand how to work and use it.
 It's still early days for the technology, which isn't as accurate and precise as it needs to be. But both BD and UAV del Peru see major potential to use drones to deliver potentially life-saving supplies in the most remote parts of the world.

 The retail stock carnage will only get worse as Amazon continues to mow down certain corners of the sector, according to Bernstein.
 ""We are currently in the midst of a generational shift in consumer behavior and how companies bring their goods to market,"" the firm's analyst Ali Dibadj wrote in a note to clients Friday.
""The only thing one can be certain about is that things will change and companies will be disrupted, and when it comes to disruption there has never been a company quite like Amazon.""
 The retail sector is having a rough year so far as the industry struggles under the Amazon onslaught.
The SPDR S&P Retail ETF's declined 9 percent year to date through Friday compared to the S&P 500's 15 percent gain and Amazon's 50 percent surge in the same time period.
Dibadj shared his imminent Amazon disruption predictions for each consumer subsector:
 1. Consumer packaged goods: ""We think beverages/snacks companies will fare better than household & personal care companies, while packaged food companies are likely most at risk."" 2. Restaurants: ""The benefits of a potential national delivery network through Amazon Restaurants outweighs the relatively modest risk presented by Amazon's placing possible downward pressure on food prices (proteins appear more insulated)."" 3. Transportation: ""Structural volume growth in e-commerce will benefit the network carriers, and the significant hurdle posed by the costs of last mile delivery is likely to result in better pricing."" 4. Broadline retailers: ""We think the scale of Walmart's existing network of distribution centers, stores, and new pick-up points we expect ... will allow them to adapt well to the higher costs, while smaller grocers will be more damaged."" 5. Specialty apparel retail: ""We see the off-price retailers retaining their competitive advantage in apparel, for now."" 6. Healthcare services: ""We think Amazon's entry into pharmacy would be negative for independent pharmacies, somewhat negative for national pharmacies and distributors, and we increasingly see this as long term negative for"" pharmacy benefit managers. 
The analyst also explained how the internet and social media have generally hurt the power of traditional brands, further adding to the companies' difficulties.

 Beijing Sinnet Technology said Tuesday it would buy parts of Amazon's cloud business in China for up to 2 billion Chinese yuan ($301 million), but the U.S. e-commerce giant said it was not exiting the world's second-largest economy. 
 In August 2016, Amazon signed a deal to let Chinese tech firm Sinnet operate services provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in China. 
Sinnet said in a regulatory filing on Monday that the purchase, which is still pending, would help it ""comply with China's laws to further improve the company's AWS cloud services"" in terms of quality and security. 
 But Amazon said that it is only selling ""certain physical assets"" and still owns the intellectual property for AWS worldwide. 
""No, AWS did not sell its business in China and remains fully committed to ensuring Chinese customers continue to receive AWS's industry leading cloud services. Chinese law forbids non-Chinese companies from owning or operating certain technology for the provision of cloud services. As a result, in order to comply with Chinese law, AWS sold certain physical infrastructure assets to Sinnet, its longtime Chinese partner and AWS seller-of-record for its AWS China (Beijing) Region,"" Amazon told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa.
""AWS continues to own the intellectual property for AWS Services worldwide. ‎We're excited about the significant business we have in China and its growth potential over the next number of years.""
The deal could be linked to increasing regulatory scrutiny from the Chinese government who is trying to tighten their grip on the internet in the country. Sinnet asked its customers earlier this year to stop using virtual private networks (VPNs), which are able to circumvent China's Great Firewall. 
Other U.S. firms have also faced a challenging situation in China. In July, Apple removed VPNs from its app store in China, amid the crackdown on such services by the government. 
AWS has been a jewel in the crown for Amazon's earnings in recent times and a big reason why the company's shares are up over 50 percent year-to-date.

 Cramer on Home Depot: Amazon will not take them out   
 12:08  PM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 |  02:09 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday that Home Depot's quarterly earnings show that the company is a ""survivor"" and online retail giant Amazon will likely not ""knock them out.""
 The largest U.S. home improvement chain reported third-quarter same-store sales on Tuesday that blew past Wall Street estimates, helped by repairs after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. It also beat on earnings and revenue during the quarter.
The Dow component was slightly higher intraday Tuesday, trading near $166 a share — though the stock was down slightly earlier in premarket trade.
 Cramer said investors tend to sell the stock on Amazon worries, and then a few weeks later the stock rises. ""And I think that pattern will be repeated because they're one of the survivors,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street. ""And Amazon hasn't gone after them.""
""Selling Home Depot ahead of the conference call has been time-honored,"" Cramer added. ""And then you sell more because you're worried about Amazon.""
The e-commerce giant, whose stock is up more than 50 percent this year, has been aggressive in its efforts to expand its retail presence, including through partnerships and major acquisitions. Yet, Amazon hasn't succeeded in amassing the same product assortments as Home Depot.
""That was a great comp,"" Cramer added about Home Depot. ""The company is going to have a good quarter. They reaffirmed.""
""When Amazon starts shipping plants, I'm going to rethink my analysis,"" Cramer said.

Here's why  Target 'squeezed' between Amazon and Wal-Mart right now: Telsey Advisory Group  ","Adam Jeffery | CNBC 
George Soros speaking at the 2015 CGI Annual Meeting in New York.
 George Soros' investment fund dumped its stock holdings in Apple and Snap in the last quarter while reducing stakes in other major tech giants including Facebook and Twitter, regulatory filings show.
 The billionaire investor's hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, sold 1,700 shares of Apple, and 1.55 million of Snap stock in the September quarter. This wiped out the hedge fund's stake in both companies, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings released Tuesday revealed.
It's important to note that the fund's holdings in Apple were relatively small, worth just $291,278 at Tuesday's market close. 
 However the Snap holding is significant. The 1.55 million shares were worth $19.48 million at Tuesday's close. 
There is a lot of bearishness around Snap, which has continued to miss earnings expectations and failed to grow its user base significantly. Snap shares are down over 48 percent since it went public in March. Wall Street analysts are also not sold on Snap. The stock has 19 ""hold"" ratings, nine ""sell,"" and one ""strong sell,"" according to Reuters data. 
Soros Fund Management also reduced its stake in Twitter by 5,700 shares. It still holds 18,400 shares of the social media site.
Facebook also fell out of favor with Soros. The investor dumped 367,262 shares of the social networking giant in the last quarter. Soros Fund Management still owns 109,451 Facebook shares.
But not all names in the technology sector were sold off. Soros upped his stake in Microsoft by 99,000 shares and Amazon by 2,500 shares.
The SEC filings only show the change in share ownership of Soros' fund, but no commentary as to his fund's thinking behind the trades.
Major technology stocks have been on a tear this year, although some of the newly-listed names such as Snap have struggled. 
Apple, which Soros' hedge fund also sold all its shares in, is up nearly 48 percent year-to-date. Analysts are excited at the potential of the new iPhone X, released earlier this month. Apple shares hit a record high last week.
Soros' position contrasts to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which topped up on Apple shares in the last quarter. Buffett's conglomerate increased its holdings of the iPhone maker's stock by 3.9 million to 134.1 million, a SEC filing released Tuesday showed.

 Amazon just cut turkey prices for Thanksgiving at Whole Foods   
 1:57  PM ET Thu, 16 Nov 2017 |  00:43 
 Whole Foods has cut prices on holiday staples and other groceries, Amazon announced Wednesday.
 Customers will be able to purchase organic or non-antibiotic turkeys at a reduced price of $3.49 per pound and $2.49 per pound, respectively. Members of Amazon Prime will save an additional 50 cents per pound on both varieties, the company said in a release. A Whole Foods representative told CNBC that cashiers will identify Amazon Prime members when customers present coupons sent via email. 
The company didn't say how much of a discount it was offering.
 ""We're just getting started"" on reducing prices after the Amazon buyout closed in August, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey said in a statement. ""We'll continue to work closely together to ensure we're consistently surprising and delighting our customers while moving toward our goal of reaching more people.""

 Amazon cuts prices again at Whole Foods, including some holiday staples   
 9:52  AM ET Wed, 15 Nov 2017 |  01:41 
 New discounts also are for products including chicken breasts, shrimp, canned pumpkin and specialty potatoes.
Before Amazon's acquisition, Whole Foods was known pejoratively as Whole Paycheck because of its high prices.
Afterward, Amazon marked down certain Whole Foods products, including on produce and fish.
Grocers like ShopRite often have promotions where shoppers can earn a free turkey by purchasing a set amount of groceries in the weeks leading into the holidays.
Last week, the investment arm of Moody's said in a note that Kroger ""will remain a market leader"" among groceries. Moody's believes the Cincinnati-based chain is the ""best equipped among its peers"" to deal with an escalating price war from Amazon, saying Kroger's ""strong private label brand"" gives it a distinct advantage. 
Grocers are in a race to the bottom when it comes to price. Big-box retailer Target and Wal-Mart have made investments to slash prices on frequently purchased items, while value players Lidl and Aldi are expanding rapidly across the U.S.
 Against the backdrop of a down market, shares of both Kroger and Sprouts traded over 1 percent lower Wednesday.

Jeff Bezos
 Almost half of all online shopping will be on Amazon.com this holiday season, cementing Jeff Bezos's commercial grip over one of the most important seasons, according to one analyst.
 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey said Amazon's ever-broadening product selection and the popular shift toward online shopping will lead to big profit for the e-commerce giant. In a note to clients, analyst Youssef Squali argued that the current Adobe projections for online sales are too low.
""Adobe is projecting online holiday shopping sales to hit $107.4 billion in the U.S.,"" wrote Squali in a note to clients. ""Given a record breaking Prime Day in 2Q, continued momentum in 3Q, and the fact that this is just the second holiday season offering monthly Prime memberships, we expect a record-breaking holiday season for the company.""
 Amazon shares fell 0.8 percent in midday Wednesday after the report. Its shares are up 50 percent year to date through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 15 percent gain.
The analyst has a buy rating on Amazon as well as a price target of $1,270, which is 12 percent above its current price.
Suntrust isn't the only analyst bullish on Amazon. In similar fashion, Morgan Stanley outlined a case for the company to reach a $1 trillion valuation.
Morgan Stanley reiterated its overweight call on Amazon shares, presenting a potential ""bull case"" with a 12-month price target of $2,000 per share, or roughly a $1 trillion market cap.
""Amazon's high margin [revenue] disclosure speaks to the $1trln ($2,000/sh) sum of parts bull case,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients Sunday.
While Amazon's ascent to retail monarchy has been the product of years of logistical tailoring, SunTrust's Squali argues that there are multiple reasons why Adobe's Digital Insights numbers may be too low.
 Adobe's Model Underestimates Historically
 ""Adobe's model has historically projected growth rates below actual growth rates,"" wrote Squali. ""Last year, Adobe projected 10 percent year over year vs. 14 percent year over year actual, and in 2015 the projection of 11 percent year over year was well short of the actual 18 percent year over year.""

 When Amazon recently announced plans to abruptly shut down the Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service in parts of nine states, it did not provide much of an explanation for the decision.
But multiple sources tell Recode that Amazon has privately laid blame on the U.S. Postal Service, which was responsible for delivering Amazon Fresh orders to customers in most, if not all, of the affected delivery areas.
Specifically, Amazon officials have told several food brands that the USPS had delivered an unreliable experience to customers with too many late or missed deliveries, according to people familiar with the discussions. With no other good delivery options for fresh food in these areas, Amazon decided to shut down the service.
 These brands were also told the economics of the business were harder in the service areas that Amazon chose to shut down, because they were less densely populated.
Managers inside Amazon Fresh warehouses have also cited the Postal Service relationship as a reason for scaling back the delivery service, multiple sources said. In one instance, some workers were told that Amazon balked at new delivery rates USPS was going to charge the company for deliveries in the areas in which Amazon ended up curtailing the service.
In another case, workers were told that the Postal Service's inability to deliver groceries in disposable paper bags was a problem.
An Amazon spokeswoman declined to comment. A U.S. Postal Service spokesman referred this reporter to Amazon.

Is your state ready to write Amazon a blank check? Slow down, Georgia politician Stacey Abrams says.Ron Conway thinks Silicon Valley needs to have its 'eyes wide open' to Trump, immigration and U.S. politicsSteve Jurvetson defends himself: 'No such allegations are true'
In early November, Amazon Fresh customers in parts of at least nine states received an email from  Amazon stating that it was shutting down the service in their area by the end of the month.
The grocery delivery service costs $14.99 a month on top an Amazon Prime membership, which runs $99 a year. Customers who place orders in the morning receive their delivery of perishable and packaged foods on the same day; later orders are delivered the following morning.
Amazon created the service in 2007, but did not expand it outside of its hometown of Seattle until 2013. Since then, the service had grown to a bunch of cities across California, as well New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas and Miami, among others. It is still live in sections of these cities.
In some markets, Amazon handles the delivery of groceries itself in green Amazon Fresh trucks or outsources it to local delivery companies. In others, the Postal Service takes on the delivery role.
The grocery partnership between Amazon and the U.S. Postal Service began with  a trial in San Francisco in 2014 and  the Postal Service won approval for an expanded multi-year test later that year. The Postal Service also instituted Sunday deliveries of non-grocery packages for Amazon several years ago.
The move to scale back the Fresh service was surprising to some in the wake of Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods, which signaled a long-term investment in the grocery market. Dozens of disappointed Amazon Fresh customers reached out to Recode in the wake of news.
Amazon's chief financial officer said on a recent earnings call that there would be more cooperation over time between Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and Prime Now, which is a one-hour delivery service that offers a limited selection of fresh groceries. An Amazon spokeswoman previously told Recode that the Whole Foods acquisition did not play a role in the decision to end Amazon Fresh deliveries in certain markets.

Jeff Bezos speaking at the new New York Economic Club luncheon in New York on Oct. 27, 2016.
 Amazon is finally being forced to take a hands-on approach to tax collection.
 Next year the company will begin collecting sales tax for its third-party merchants in its home state of Washington, according to an announcement made this week through an Amazon sellers forum.
Marketplace Tax Collection, the new service, will automatically ""calculate, collect, and remit"" sales tax for third-party merchants selling products to customers in certain states, Amazon said. Washington will be first because the state passed a law that goes into effect on Jan. 1, requiring all online marketplaces — like Amazon — to collect sales tax on behalf of its third-party sellers.
 This is new territory for Amazon, which to date has charged sales tax on products it sells directly to consumers while leaving it up to sellers on the platform to handle their own tax collection. Those transactions only require a tax if the merchant has a physical presence in the state of the buyer. 
Washington is removing that loophole and saying that all internet sales get taxed. Now, if an electronics retailer in Cleveland sells a TV to a customer in Seattle, Amazon will handle the relevant tax collection and payment, regardless of the location of the sender or the fulfillment center.
 'Copycat this effort'
 Other states are likely to follow, said James Thomson, a partner at BuyBox Experts and former Amazon head of services.
""With Amazon now agreeing to collect and remit sales taxes for Washington state, I expect every other state will aim to copycat this effort,"" Thomson said. It makes ""it easier for states to collect sales tax for marketplace sales,"" he said.
 States including Minnesota and Rhode Island will likely become eligible for the service once their laws kick into effect in the coming years. As of now, sellers in states other than Washington are still ""responsible for their tax obligations,"" Amazon said.
As Amazon's influence grows, there's big money at stake. U.S. e-commerce sales are expected to reach $500 billion by 2018, according to Forrester. The Multistate Tax Commission estimates there's more than $2 billion in annual uncollected taxes on sales just from Amazon sellers that use the company's warehouses.
""This concept of a mass mall that exists out there in the cloud — it's taken the states a while to get their heads around it,"" said Scott Peterson, vice president of U.S. tax policy and government relations for tax software developer Avalara. ""Momentum is building towards a lot of people collecting in the future that never collected before.""

 South Carolina slaps a $500 million price tag on Amazon's sales tax   
 4:17  PM ET Fri, 10 Nov 2017 |  00:48 
 South Carolina is arguing that its existing laws already require Amazon to collect sales tax from third-party merchants because the company has fulfillment centers in the state and handles so much of the processing.
The state filed a lawsuit earlier this year, claiming Amazon owes an estimated $57 million in uncollected sales tax in 2016, and South Carolina sees an additional $500 million in tax obligations for the next five years.
Amazon said in its quarterly filing that it intends to defend itself ""vigorously"" in the case.
Some states have laid responsibility on individual sellers. Twenty-five states came together this year to offer a new sales tax amnesty program for sellers on Amazon and other online marketplaces. Members would get to waive part of their back tax obligations in return for committing to collect sales tax going forward.
But without new laws enforcing internet sales taxes, the response has been meek with only 850 sellers signing up so far. It's too costly and laborious for sellers to do all the work on their own, Peterson said.
""Sellers do their best to do it right in their home state, but no one really wants to collect outside their home state,"" he said.

 Amazon quietly launched an app called Relay to go after truck drivers   
 6:10  PM ET Fri, 17 Nov 2017 |  00:46 
 Amazon has quietly launched an app designed to help truck delivery drivers get in and out of warehouses faster.
 The app, called Relay, rolled out late last month and is available on Apple and Android devices. Drivers enter cargo information into the app, allowing them to check in with a QR code and get through the security gate, avoiding the manual process of badging in. At some facilities, Amazon has built special Relay lanes, according to the app page.
Relay is Amazon's first attempt at automating the truck delivery process, which is error-prone due to its reliance on phone calls and paperwork. About 80 percent of cargo in the U.S. is transported via truck, which makes the market a big target for tech companies like Uber and start-ups such as Convoy and Trucker Path. According to Convoy, the trucking market is worth $800 billion.
 While Relay may have a narrow application today, it serves as the first connection point between Amazon and potentially millions of truck drivers, a job that's become one of the most common in the U.S. Amazon is reportedly looking into other services as well, including an app that would match truck drivers with cargo shippers.
 Amazon has made no secret about its quest to become a logistics and transportation juggernaut. Over the past couple years, it has purchased thousands of trailer trucks, dozens of cargo planes and minority stakes in two cargo airlines for its Prime Air service. It's also launched new delivery services like Amazon Flex to do package shipping on its own.
Amazon often launches new services without a public notice to test them before expanding more aggressively. For example, the company has dozens of pop-up stores and private label brands, as well as a thriving merchant lending business — all of which launched without big, splashy announcements.
Amazon may be keeping quiet about Relay to fix some technical glitches. Its Android app has fewer than 5,000 downloads and a mere 3.5-star rating, with one reviewer saying it has ""a lot of glitches.""

 As shares rebound to all-time highs, Wall Street suddenly thinks Wal-Mart is 'playing offense' against Amazon.
 Shares of Wal-Mart closed up nearly 11 percent to record highs Thursday on the heels of a big earnings beat and strong online sales growth. The company posted its single best day in nine years.
In light of the good news, a number of Street analysts have begun changing their tune on Wal-Mart. Though worries had been brewing about Amazon's dominance in retail, Baird analyst Peter Benedict believes Wal-Mart stands a fighting chance.
 ""With a solid foundation in place, Wal-Mart is increasingly playing offense,"" wrote Benedict in a note to clients. ""Efforts to broaden the online assortment, improve the customer value proposition (free two-day shipping, pick-up discounts on non-store items), and enhance convenience have helped fuel the impressive ramp in U.S. ecommerce sales growth.""
Wal-Mart's ""becoming a powerful omni-channel force,"" he said.
The Arkansas-based retailer posted another quarter of remarkable growth online. Internet sales added 50 percent in the fiscal third quarter, roughly one year after the company acquired Jet.com.
But Benedict wasn't alone in his praise. Oppenheimer's Rupesh Parikh also complimented Wal-Mart's performance and bumped his price target to $105.
 ""Wal-Mart represents a top pick within the consumer sector,"" he wrote. ""Accelerating grocery momentum, improving prowess online, and strengthening market share gains vs. key competitors are apt to facilitate an ongoing flow of funds into the shares.""
Despite the high praise, Wall Street wasn't always this bullish. One year ago the average analyst price target on Wal-Mart hovered around $74, far below the current share price of $99, according to FactSet.
Much of the qualms in retail revolve around Amazon's impressive growth and scale. Grocery stocks fell en masse this summer after news of Amazon's bid for Whole Foods Market broke. With speculation over Jeff Bezos's next move ranging from more apparel and films to a new segment in pharmaceuticals, many brick-and-mortar retailers are bracing for another blow.
Exactly two years ago, Stifel analysts told clients that Wal-Mart had a lot of work to do if it wanted to do battle with the Amazon.
""Wal-Mart has to keep their head down, invest, and work to impress the shopper while the competitive landscape won't give them any breaks (Amazon shipping under 8 ounces and under $10 for free from Kentucky DC, Target, dollar stores, ALDI, and grocers like Kroger).""
Though the Stifel team hasn't changed its hold rating on Wal-Mart, it is impressed with the progress it sees.
""We believe Wal-Mart's continued comp growth and strong e-commerce results better position it to compete against online competitors compared to retailer peers,"" wrote analyst Mark Astrachan on Thursday. ""The F3Q result suggests investments in price, people, and stores continue to favorably impact traffic and overall comp, in our view, and shows Wal-Mart is effectively competing in a tough retail environment.""

 });CEO of Voysis, Peter Cahill.
 Irish start-up Voysis has created an artificial intelligence (AI) voice assistant that it is aiming to license to retailers in a bid to help them compete with e-commerce titan Amazon.
 Voysis' voice technology, which launched Thursday, can be integrated into an online retailer's app or mobile website allowing shoppers to buy products using their voices.
It's a direct competitor to the Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice assistants.
 While Alexa may seem the natural fit for retailers to partner with, given the size of the company and the heavy investment it is putting on AI, Voysis argues that stores could lose the ability to know their customers by partnering with Amazon.
""Retailers know that their customers don't know what they want when they come to their site. That's why so many have invested in website tools, retargeting and more. We help them give users a better mobile search experience, helping them find what they're looking for much faster,"" Voysis CEO Peter Cahill told CNBC by email.
""Amazon also owns the relationship with the customer on its platform and retailers could be justified in thinking Amazon would attempt to usurp their position in the market. With Voysis Commerce, every brand and retailer can have it's own Alexa.""
Amazon's voice assistant works via ""Skills"". These are essentially apps that developers can make that work with Alexa. For example, a news website could create a skill for Alexa that allows a user to ask for the main headlines.
But not many retailers have created skills for Amazon. In the U.K., Ocado has made a skill that lets users shop via Alexa, and in the U.S. 1-800 Flowers allows people to place orders via voice.
Voysis is hoping to establish itself as the major voice assistant in the space.
But it faces a tough task. Amazon already has hundreds of developers on board, and the scale of the platform could make it appealing to potential retailers. On top of that, it has managed to launch its voice platform in international markets such as India and Japan, which could allow it to tap retailers in those countries.
Earlier this year, Voysis raised $8 million in a funding round led by venture capital firm Polaris Partners.

 Wal-Mart has awaken, and Amazon should be worried: Former JCP CEO   
 6:24  PM ET Thu, 16 Nov 2017 |  04:16 
 Enjoy.com CEO and founder Ron Johnson thinks Amazon should be really worried about competitor Walmart, but could fight back with another big acquisition.
 ""I think this is a decade-long price fight. Every quarter is a new round, but Walmart's coming back,"" Johnson said on CNBC's ""Fast Money.""
The former J.C. Penney CEO has been bullish on Walmart since at least February, when he appeared on ""Fast Money"" and called the big box retailer's rally. On Thursday, Walmart shares had their best day in nine years. With stock up 44 percent year-to-date, Walmart appeared to confirm Johnson's predictions that it could be Amazon's biggest threat.
 Amazon may be growing fast, but Johnson thinks Walmart has a decided advantage with its preexisting brick-and-mortar infrastructure. He explained that most Americans live near a Walmart where they can buy most of what is available on Amazon.
As Amazon continues to invest in its distribution centers, Walmart has chosen to slow store growth, focusing instead on the technology it needs to improve the stores it already has — a considerably cheaper endeavor.
And Johnson maintains that Amazon's distribution centers are more expensive and less efficient to run than Walmart's store and warehouses.
""They forward deploy inventory into things called warehouses, that are really stores. They are a lower cost operation than amazon's distribution centers,"" Johnson said.
""Having that distribution footprint with that inventory forward deployed is an advantage that is hard to beat,"" he added.
As for Amazon, Johnson thinks acquisitions like Whole Foods, are a good move for the internet retailer. And Target is right on brand.
""Whole Foods is to grocery, what Target is to mass. It's the upscale discounter,"" he said.
While Johnson doesn't anticipate that mega-acquisition anytime soon, he said he does think Target has all the right amount of space in all the right places for Amazon to stay on top of the competition.
""Target's got 1,500 stores on Main and Main of every city in the country,"" Johnson said.

 John Malone says Amazon is a 'Death Star'   
 2:14  PM ET Thu, 16 Nov 2017 |  01:06 
 Liberty Media Chairman John Malone believes Amazon will dominate the future and is the only company that has a chance to beat Netflix.
 Netflix CEO Reed Hastings ""has been successful in throwing hail Mary passes and then growing into them. And I think he is going to continue doing that. He's got a great service. He's disintermediating the studio industry by going directly to the talent,"" Malone said in an exclusive interview with CNBC's David Faber Thursday at the Liberty Media annual investor meeting.
""The only outfit right now that has a chance of overtaking them would be Amazon.""
 The investor noted the cable industry missed its opportunity to compete with Netflix in the past and said ""it's way too late"" now. He added that in today's media world Netflix has the lead position due to its size and subscriber base. 
The internet ""makes scale even more important in the media business, where scale always was important. It's all about scale,"" he said. Netflix was ""the first wave. And I think Jeff [Bezos] is gonna be the most disruptive. As [his] Death Star moves into striking range of every industry on the planet.""

Jeff Bezos
 He explained that Amazon's business dominance is growing stronger. Malone said any company that sells products to consumers is at risk of being crushed by the e-commerce giant.
""If you're in the B2C business, if you're selling anything to any consumer anywhere on the planet, you gotta believe that Amazon is gonna have a look at that opportunity to commoditize you to use scale to serve the public,"" he said. Bezos is ""reducing cost to the consumer and providing great convenience ... You just got to take your hat off and envy what he has built.""
Malone is widely respected as one of the most astute deal makers in the media and cable industries. He built and ran his cable empire TCI from the 1970s and sold it to AT&T in 1999 for roughly $50 billion. The investor has a net worth of nearly $8 billion, according to Forbes.

 Amazon Keyallows you to order goods from Amazon and have them delivered inside of your home instead of on the doorstep. It consists of a smart lock and a camera that's always supposed to be connected to Wi-Fi. 
Rhino Security Labs found that by launching a distributed denial of service attack against the camera -- that is, flooding it with random information requests -- they could disable the camera temporarily. This let them drop off a package, leave the house, and then sneak back in without the camera detecting their presence a second time. This could leave an Amazon Key household open to theft. The flaw was first covered by Wired.
 Amazon says that based on an initial review of the security research, the company believes the findings pose little risk to consumers, but they are taking quick action. The security update will alert users immediately if Wi-Fi latency issues result in a lag of the Cloud Cam.
""Safety and security are built into every aspect of the service,"" Amazon told CNBC. ""Every delivery driver passes a comprehensive background check that is verified by Amazon before they can make in-home deliveries, every delivery is connected to a specific driver, and before we unlock the door for a delivery, Amazon verifies that the correct driver is at the right address, at the intended time. We currently notify customers if the camera is offline for an extended period. Later this week we will deploy an update to more quickly provide notifications if the camera goes offline during delivery. The service will not unlock the door if the WiFi is disabled and the camera is not online.""
Rhino Security Labs published the following video online, purporting to show the attack in action:

 Wal-Mart just proved it's a match for Amazon   
 3:50  PM ET Thu, 16 Nov 2017 |  00:52 
 Wal-Mart isn't afraid of Amazon. No, not even in the slightest.
 The big-box retailer is laser-focused on internal initiatives, according to Wal-Mart's head of U.S. e-commerce, Marc Lore. That includes luring more high-end brands to sell on Walmart.com and across its stores, expanding an online grocery pickup service and keeping prices competitive but not necessarily at rock bottom.
Wal-Mart's stock rocketed more than 10 percent Thursday, reaching an all-time high, as Wall Street rallied behind the company's upbeat third-quarter results and heavy momentum heading into the holiday season.
 ""The discount giant is clearly reaping the benefits of its massive investments in associates, stores, technology, and acquisitions,"" Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins wrote in a note to clients. ""Walmart is taking share and growing its food business.""
Food was a notable bright spot in Wal-Mart's latest quarter, even in the midst of Amazon buying supermarket chain Whole Foods and beginning to slash prices on frequently purchased items. Target has also made additional price cuts in recent months, aligning more closely with Wal-Mart's ""everyday low price"" model.
But shoppers continue to flock to Wal-Mart for fresh produce, bakery items and meat, management pointed out. Currently, more than 1,100 of the retailer's U.S. stores can fulfill online grocery orders for in-person pickup, and Wal-Mart plans to add another 1,000 locations to that list next year.
""New customers, suppliers and partnerships are coming to Wal-Mart,"" as its grocery and other initiatives blossom, Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on a call with analysts and investors. ""We're making good progress attracting premium brands to [Walmart.com] such as KitchenAid and Bose.""
Over the past year, Wal-Mart said, it tripled the number of items on Walmart.com to reach more than 70 million SKUs today, and some of that growth stems from unique relationships with well-known brands.
Earlier this week, the company announced an upcoming partnership with Hudson's Bay's Lord & Taylor, where Walmart.com will feature a ""store within a store"" for the department store chain's merchandise.
Wal-Mart's Lore has already hinted at more of these types of partnerships to come, as it prepares to launch a redesigned website with a focus on fashion and home goods. Next year, Walmart.com will also run Jet.com's ""smart-cart"" feature, which grants shoppers cheaper prices if they pack more items together in one box, use a debit card when paying for purchases, or opt out of returns.
Wal-Mart's acquisition of Jet about one year ago has allowed the company to tap into Jet's technology, its younger consumer base and private-label penetration.
As part of a strengthened digital push, Wal-Mart will hire about 2,000 ""category specialists"" to monitor the company's website and rewrite item descriptions, among other tasks. The personal touches are aimed at holding onto existing customers, but also attracting a more ""affluent"" shopper.
""Walmart's longer-term aim is clear: it wants to become the go-to online destination for both every day and specialty items,"" GlobalData Retail Managing Director Neil Saunders wrote in a note to clients.
Meantime, ""for a retailer of its size and scale, we believe that Walmart's ability to keep its stores growing is impressive,"" Saunders added.
According to Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen, ""[P]hysical stores arm Wal-Mart in the digital war.""
Without such a vast physical store footprint, Amazon's retail strategy has been to partner with brands, including Nike, Tapestry's Kate Spade and Levi Strauss, to create a broader and more appealing merchandise assortment on Amazon.com.
And on Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that this holiday season Calvin Klein will for the first time sell new underwear styles only through Amazon, bypassing traditional department stores. That marks another brand in Amazon's bucket.
Still, Wal-Mart has a lot of good things going for it, especially heading into the holidays. The retailer has set expectations for comparable sales at U.S. stores, excluding fuel, to increase as much as 2 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, which would be slightly better compared with last year.
""We expect top-line growth going forward to be led more by comp sales and eCommerce with less emphasis on new units in the U.S.,"" Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said. ""We have good sales momentum and cost transformation is gaining traction.""

Baidu's Raven H smart home speaker comes with an LED display touch controller that can be detached from the base of the device and used independently to voice control other Raven compatible devices.
 Chinese internet search giant Baidu on Thursday introduced a speaker and two robots as part of its Raven series in a serious push into the highly competitive smart home market. 
 The products, introduced at the Baidu World conference in Beijing, are powered by the company's DuerOS conversational artificial intelligence technology. That system is similar to virtual assistants like Amazon's Alexa, the Google Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana.
The smart speaker is called Raven H and will be available for purchase in December for about 1,699 yuan ($256). Design-wise, the speaker looks like a stack of thin, colored square blocks and it comes with a touch-sensitive light-emitting diode (LED) display controller.
 The controller can be detached from the speaker base and used as a voice-powered remote for all Raven-compatible smart home devices. 
The speaker was designed by Raven Tech, a start-up that Baidu acquired in February, and Swedish consumer electronics manufacturer Teenage Engineering. It also has components from Danish high-end audio systems maker Tymphany.
The DuerOS allows the device to carry out other voice-based commands and tasks such as looking up information, playing music and hailing a taxi, according to Baidu. 
The idea behind the Raven H is to make the interaction between man and machine as seamless as possible, according to Jesse Lyu, the founder of Raven Tech, who joined Baidu's intelligent hardware unit as general manager. 
""Its adjustable design lets its [users] move through their home or workspace, while remaining connected to both the Raven H system and their personal world,"" Lyu said in a statement.
That said, the Raven H will face stiff competition in the smart home speaker market, which according to Strategy Analytics, is currently dominated by Amazon.
Baidu also introduced the Raven R, a multi-jointed robotic arm that can move in response to user commands and to express emotions. 
A second robot — still in development — is Raven Q, which will eventually incorporate various technologies, such as simultaneous localization and mapping, computer vision, voice recognition and natural processing. 
Baidu did indicate any pricing or availability details for the Raven R and Raven Q robots in the announcement.
""Each product in our new Raven series is integrated with Baidu's latest AI technologies, including facial recognition, computer vision and even our Apollo autonomous driving technology,"" Lyu told the conference audience.
""These smart speakers and AI home robot may sound like a small step in the history of technology — but they will help people's everyday lives and bring them an experience once only seen in sci-fi movies,"" Lyu said.

 David Damavandi should be an Amazon success story.
 Using the company's marketplace, the 31-year-old entrepreneur built revenues in his skin care business to more than $10 million annually in seven years, thanks in large part to having the most popular facial steamer on Amazon.com.
But rather than gearing up for Cyber Monday and a potential blockbuster holiday season, Damavandi's Los Angeles-based company, Pure Daily Care, is in crisis. For the bulk of 2017, he says he's been under assault by a rival brand named Krasr, which he says ripped off his top product, spoofed his email address and tricked customers into posting a barrage of negative reviews.

 Cramer's Mad Dash: Amazon can't destroy everyone   
 10:40  AM ET Fri, 17 Nov 2017 |  01:34 
 In one text message to Damavandi, a person purporting to represent Krasr called himself the ""virus of Amazon"" and threatened to put him out of business. 
""Cash flow is dead,"" said Damavandi, who's already let go of half of his 12 employees. ""These guys are putting people out of business overnight.""
After a seven-week suspension from Amazon and $400,000 in estimated lost revenue, Damavandi's storefront — Beauty Imports — was reinstated on Nov. 8. Now he's sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars of inventory that he has to sell at a deep discount to pay his suppliers and remaining employees. 
The Krasr clone, meanwhile, was still listed as the best-selling product until CNBC told the company that the story was about to be published. According to Amazon's website, the product was unavailable for much of the day on Thursday and Pure Daily has now reclaimed the top spot. 
 Down the rabbit hole
 This is a story of unfettered capitalism, another example of a gigantic global technology company having a platform it can't control, where malicious actors run amok.
Facebook's vulnerabilities were exposed during the 2016 election when Russian propagandists infiltrated the network and targeted people with fake news, and Google's YouTube is in a constant struggle to determine the boundaries between free speech and over-the-top outrage.
On Amazon, the Wild West problem is particularly acute for small businesses. Millions of merchants like Damavandi have been drawn to Amazon's marketplace because of the company's massive customer base, logistics operation and global network of fulfillment centers. More than half the items sold on Amazon now come from third-party sellers.
But the marketplace is highly susceptible to fraudsters intent on exploiting the site's loopholes. While Amazon has taken steps to help brands protect themselves from counterfeits, it can't react quickly enough to the many tactics scammers are using to win business at the expense of legitimate sellers. The marketplace is just too big, with too much activity.
Damavandi's case surfaced over the summer in an Amazon seller forum post he wrote about his experience. The post was subsequently deleted, but it was archived on another website and the link was shared with CNBC. However, as of Friday, the post was gone.
We contacted Damavandi, who confirmed that he's the author. He was reluctant to cooperate for this story out of fear of retribution from Krasr, but he agreed to fill in the holes as needed.
He says his problems began in early April, when a new product from Krasr suddenly popped up in the facial steamer category with hundreds of five-star reviews. The listing for Krasr's Nanosteamer used the exact image and content from his Nanosteamer, including taking this line in its entirety:  ""A Bonus 5 piece surgical grade stainless steel blackhead and blemish extractor kit is included with every Nanosteamer.""
 Cloning a product on Amazon can be perfectly legal. However, there are still laws preventing the use of other people's photos and descriptions.
Damavandi, having spotted a clear offender, filed a copyright infringement claim with Amazon to get the Krasr product removed. He was successful.
Then, Damavandi says, the madness started. (Krasr denies the following narrative, saying in one email that, ""This is all a joke and completely made up,"" and in another that it sounds like Pure Daily is doing whatever it can to get rid of ""threats and competitors."")
Damavandi was contacted on WhatsApp by a person claiming to be ""from Krasr,"" who asked him to withdraw his infringement claim. Damavandi said he would first need Krasr to remove stolen content from its product page.
The next day, April 4, Damavandi received a puzzling email from Amazon saying the company had received his request to retract the infringement complaint.
But Damavandi says he never sent any such request. 
The email from the apparent impostor to Amazon, which CNBC has viewed, used the address that Damavandi allows Amazon to give other sellers if a conflict needs to be resolved. Krasr is the only entity that would have gotten access to that email address for that specific claim.
There were several clues it was a fake email. The sender claimed to be emailing from ""onyxdist"" — the shortened version of Onyx Distribution, Damavandi's distribution company, and also the suffix in the email address, but not a name that Damavandi would ever have used in communications. The email ends with ""Sincerely, Dama"" — referring to the prefix in the email address and a shortened version of his last name. He said he never uses this name in emails.
Damavandi tried to clear the confusion up with Amazon immediately, but the company ignored him, he said.
It's certainly not the first time Amazon has been duped. In September, CNBC reported on a fake law firm tricking the site into kicking off the seller of a popular toothbrush head. Late last year, a number of Samsung sellers were suspended because of mistaken infringement claims, and the site has become generally more chaotic in recent years since Amazon started openly courting Chinese sellers.
After the fake retraction email to Amazon, Krasr was right back up and running with its Nanosteamer. And the attacks on Damavandi's product were just beginning.
 'Let the war begin'
 A few weeks later, Damavandi got a series of messages on WhatsApp from a man who represented himself as a Krasr employee. In the messages, he threatened to take down Damavandi's listings and leave ""s--t reviews."" This person called himself the ""virus of Amazon,"" claimed to have 17 brands, and said that if Damavandi kept this up ""your store listings will go down.""
He also said, ""Let the war begin.""
Krasr's founder, Mohamed Multhazim Akbar Ali, said he has no knowledge of any such text messages being sent. 
 Texts from Krasr to Pure Daily Care
 Damavandi is not certain who this person was or how they got his phone number. However, Amazon puts third-party sellers in touch with each other to resolve disputes. So Amazon likely gave Krasr Damavandi's phone number and email address following the infringement claim.
The phone number where the text message appears to have originated started with country code 971 (United Arab Emirates). An internet search on the full number ties it to a Facebook page for a group called Amazon Best Sellers. 
The contact information on that Facebook page includes a link to a product from SnoreCare, a trademark that's owned by Ali, the same person who owns Krasr. Here's a screenshot of the Facebook page. (The last digits of the phone number have been blurred out.)
 Shortly after we contacted Ali for this story, the Facebook page disappeared. Ali also said that the Krasr and SnoreCare brands are ""totally unrelated"" — even though the terms of service page on the SnoreCare website said at the time that it was ""operated by Krasr."" After sending Ali a screenshot of that page, it was changed to say ""operated by Snore Care.""
Soon after Damavandi's text exchange, the Pure Daily device was being pummeled with one-star reviews. 
This time, Damavandi claims, somebody gained access to his seller account and figured out which of his customers had returned his product. Then, he says, that person or group sent fake emails to these customers pretending to represent Pure Daily Care and inviting them to leave poor reviews.
One of the allegedly fake emails, which CNBC has seen, promised a $200 Amazon gift card if the recipient submitted a ""truthful comment on the product experience."" (Amazon cracked down on paid or incentivized reviews last year.)
This email claimed to be from ""Susan, Chief Customer Relations of Pure-DailyCare"" and had a mailing address in Texas. (Damavandi says there is no ""Susan,"" and his company is based in California.) This email included a link to Amazon. By clicking on it, a consumer would be sent to a pre-populated one-star review of Pure's Nanosteamer. Here's what happens when we tried the link:
 According to Damavandi's post in the seller forum, his Nanosteamer listing got about 30 one-star reviews from June 6-7 — or almost as many one-star reviews as the product had received in total over the previous two years. Pure Daily saw its star rating tumble from 4.5 to 4, hurting its position on Amazon and ceding sales to other products — namely the Krasr Nanosteamer.
""We experienced a 23,000 percent increase in negative reviews in 24 hours,"" Damavandi said. He said he had to cut the price in half to $20 because of the attacks, ""but as I lowered my price they got more aggressive.""
In September, another tactic emerged. Amazon started receiving infringement claims against Pure Daily's products from Guerrilla Mail addresses, which are disposable and temporary email addresses. Then came more fake emails to Amazon, Damavandi said, which made it appear as if Pure Daily was lying about those supposed claims.
Amazon doesn't like when third-party sellers lie, and the company responded by shutting Pure Daily down. 
To support his cause for reinstatement, Damavandi hired Chris McCabe, a former Amazon employee who now helps embattled sellers.
As Damavandi was burning through cash, he and McCabe repeatedly tried to get answers from Amazon's seller performance team. They got multiple responses saying the company was reviewing the case. Almost seven weeks later and without an explanation, Pure Daily was reinstated.
McCabe said that Damavandi's case is one of the wackier he's seen, but it's far from isolated. An increasing number of spoofing cases are popping up, he said.
If Amazon ""thinks you're sending an email and you're not, that's pretty scary,"" McCabe said. ""People are getting very savvy with these schemes.""
At the time of publication, Krasr's facial steamer had lost its visibility on Amazon but other products from the company, including its blackhead remover, were still prominently ranked.
 What we know about Krasr
 Ali, Krasr's founder, is a 23-year-old Toronto resident who goes by Zim.
In his email correspondence with CNBC, Ali denied having any involvement in efforts to attack Pure Daily's listing, and said nobody from Krasr sent text messages to Pure Daily, spoofed emails, or manipulated reviews.
Ali said he's in the private labeling business. He gets manufacturers to provide him with products that he can label with his own brands and sell in various places.
""We find products that sell well and order quality goods from different countries and sell them on Amazon,"" he wrote. He said that his company sells ""the goods to multiple online retailers who resell them.""
Krasr is one of numerous trademarks owned by 10093939 Canada Corp., a company that Ali incorporated in February, according to the Government of Canada Federal Corporation Information website. He personally owns a number of other trademarks as well.
On Amazon, Krasr had been using the Daily Essentials Fulfillment storefront to sell products under the brands Ali owns. Just before publication, all the items disappeared from the storefront. The products included nose vents from SnoreCare, an electric dog collar from Bark Solution, an electronic insect killer from Pest Soldier and a disco ball strobe light from Zitronik.
If you go the websites of the brands, there's a familiar pattern. The phone numbers and addresses are often bogus. For example, the address given for Bark Solution in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, doesn't exist and the phone number doesn't work. Pest Soldier claims to have an authorized retailer in Las Vegas, but a web search on the address connects it to a locksmith. We called the locksmith, who said he'd never heard of Pest Soldier. 
 Ali declined to provide information regarding customers, retailers, or suppliers and said that ""some of the websites might have temporary addresses because they are new websites and they're not all complete.""
The only thing Ali admitted was that Krasr received an initial infringement claim from Pure Daily, and he said the image was then changed even though he disputes the allegation that his company was actually infringing. Otherwise, he said Pure Daily ""appears to be making up all these false accusations"" to frame Krasr.
Amazon tends not to offer details on specific cases, and it's no different for this story. Here's the company's statement in full:
 ""Amazon is constantly innovating on behalf of customers and sellers to ensure they buy and sell with confidence on Amazon.com, and this includes systems to prevent and detect fraud. If we discover that bad actors have abused our systems, we work quickly to take action on behalf of our customers and sellers. If a seller believes we've made a decision that requires further review, we encourage them to contact us directly so we can investigate and take the appropriate action."" 
Amazon's business certainly isn't suffering — the stock is up 52 percent this year. For the holiday period, Amazon is expected to report its fastest quarterly sales growth in over six years, with revenue jumping a projected 37 percent to $59.7 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. 
Cyber Monday deals have already started.
Damavandi, meanwhile, said he's in ""liquidation mode."" He has to get rid of excess inventory to pay the bills. And even though his store is back up, all of the negative reviews are still there.
We called Damavandi on Thursday after Krasr's product was taken down. He said that while he's likely to make more money now, he doesn't have much confidence that his business is sustainable.
""I've been trying to call attention to this for half a year now and it seems like they don't have the systems in place,"" Damavandi said. He's reluctant to invest in his Amazon business knowing ""that this guy is still out there and will probably want to come back at me one day,"" he said.
Clarification: Damavandi and McCabe were trying to reach the Amazon seller performance group, not seller support.

 });Billionaire Jeff Bezos is one of the world's richest people thanks to a risk he took when he was 30 years old. 
 When the Amazon founder and CEO was in college, he promised himself he would one day start and run his own business. At 30, Bezos made the decision to quit his job to make his dream a reality.
In a fireside chat with brother Mark Bezos at the 10th annual Summit LA conference, he said his decision required ""a lot of soul-searching."" He added that the best way to make that kind of ""very personal decision"" is by asking yourself, ""What does your heart say?""
 For Bezos, that meant living a life without regrets, especially in old age.
""For me, the best way to think about it was to project myself forward to age 80 and say, 'Look, when I'm 80 years old, I want to have minimized the number of regrets that I have,'"" he said.

 Growing up, Bezos was a straight-A high school student, the valedictorian of his class and accepted for early admission to Princeton, according to biographer Brad Stone's  ""The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon."" Bezos even thought for a moment in college that he would be a theoretical physicist.
But he scratched that plan when he instead majored in computer science and electrical engineering, then went on to work in finance after college, according to a 1999 Wired article. While working at hedge fund D. E. Shaw in the early 1990s, eight years out of college, Bezos got the idea to sell books over the Internet.
""I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles — something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world — was very exciting to me,"" Bezos said in a 2010 address at  his alma mater Princeton.
Bezos went to his boss at the time, told him about his internet bookstore idea and how he already had the support of his wife.
""I think this is a good idea, but I think this would be an even better idea for somebody that didn't already have a good job,"" Bezos said his boss told him. His manager asked Bezos to take a few days to think about it.
""So I went away and I was really trying to get my head around how to think about this,"" Bezos said.
That's when Bezos considered what his 80-year-old self would say if he did or didn't take on this opportunity.

 ""In most cases, our biggest regrets turn out to be acts of omission. It's paths not taken and they haunt us. We wonder what would have happened,"" Bezos said. ""I knew that when I'm 80, I would never regret trying this thing that I was super excited about and it failing. If it failed, fine. I would be very proud of the fact when I'm 80 that I tried. I also knew that it would always haunt me if I didn't try.""
In ""The Everything Store,"" Bezos said that he knew he would never think about why he walked away from his 1994 Wall Street bonus in his old age. Why? Because that wouldn't matter as much 50 years down the line.
""It would be a 100 percent chance of regret if I didn't try and basically a 0 percent chance of regret if I tried and failed,"" Bezos added. ""So I think that's a useful metric for any important life decision.""

 Cramer's Mad Dash: Amazon can't destroy everyone   
 10:40  AM ET Fri, 17 Nov 2017 |  01:34 
 Retail stocks are trading higher because investors have realized the ""death star"" known as Amazon ""can't destroy everybody,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said.
 The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of retail stocks in the S&P 500, was more than 2 percent higher Friday. The ETF is on pace for its best day since July 25 and is up 3.58 percent this week.
 Retailers, including Foot Locker and Gap, rose on better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
""A lot of the retailers are bouncing today because Amazon can't destroy everybody,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk Box"" on Friday. Cramer later questioned on ""Squawk on the Street"" whether retail was really dead based on earnings results.
Gap shares, mentioned by Cramer, were around 6 percent higher Friday after the clothing retailer beat expectations across the board, including same-store sales.
""You get this number, you have to ask yourself: Is retail really dead?"" Cramer said. ""(Gap) is a mall-based retailer to a large extent and they're putting up good numbers."" 
""Some companies are a little less dead"" than others, the host of CNBC's ""Mad Money"" added. ""It's not as final. ...The death star cannot destroy everyone. Some of them have force fields right now.""
Cramer also said that UPS and FedEx are good buys. Investors worried last month about reports that Amazon is experimenting with a new delivery service. ""I would be buying FedEx with both hands here,"" Cramer said.

 Retail stocks are surging, here's how they're surviving Amazon's world   
 8:01  PM ET Fri, 17 Nov 2017 |  04:34 
 The stock market is saying internet giants are eating the world and companies need to figure out how to survive their onslaught in the new digital age.
 Amazon and Netflix shares are up 52 percent and 58 percent respectively through Thursday compared to the S&P 500's 15.5 percent gain.
Billionaire John Malone explained why he believes these two technology companies will dominate the future. He is not dismayed by Netflix's guidance of up to $8 billion in content spending next year and multi-billion dollar cash burn. In fact he believes the company's massive investments are essential for its success.  The internet ""makes scale even more important in the media business, where scale always was important. It's all about scale,"" Malone said at the Liberty Media annual investor meeting Thursday.
 Netflix was ""the first wave. And I think Jeff [Bezos] is gonna be the most disruptive. As [his] Death Star moves into striking range of every industry on the planet.""
Some investors have lamented over the sky-high price to earnings multiples for Amazon and Netflix. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn questioned the valuations of the two companies in his letter to clients on Oct. 24. ""Our strategy relies on the assumption that the equity value of a company equals the market's best assessment of the current and future profits discounted at the company's cost of capital,"" Einhorn wrote.
But investors may want to take a longer term view appraising profit streams in this increasingly disruptive world. Companies' near terms earnings are of little consequence, if their businesses get crushed by Amazon or Netflix in a few years.
""The only thing one can be certain about is that things will change and companies will be disrupted,"" Bernstein consumer analyst Ali Dibadj wrote on Nov. 10. Disney's stock price moves following its Nov. 9 fourth quarter results was telling. Initially the shares fell more than 3 percent during the extended hours session after the media giant reported weaker-than-expected earnings versus the Wall Street consensus.
But the company's shares rallied after it revealed plans to price its upcoming streaming service ""substantially below"" Netflix on its conference call. Disney shares traded up 2 percent the following day after the report.
Even though the media company missed its earnings, the market rewarded Disney for its aggressive pricing strategy to achieve scale against Netflix.
Wal-Mart and New York Times represent two other examples of old elephants learning how to dance in the new digital age.
Retail stocks have suffered this year due to competitive pressures from Amazon. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF's declined 8 percent year to date through Thursday, however Wal-Mart shares are up 44 percent.

 Analysts have lauded the world's largest retailer for aggressively investing in its online sales business to compete against Amazon. Wal-Mart acquired e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion in Sept. 2016. ""With a solid foundation in place, Wal-Mart is increasingly playing offense,"" Baird analyst Peter Benedict wrote in a note to clients Thursday. It is ""becoming a powerful omni-channel force.""
New York Times shares are also up handsomely this year. Its shares are 32 percent through Thursday after three consecutive years of mediocre returns.
Even as the media company's print ad sales have plummeted this year, down 20 percent in its most recent quarter, the market is boosting New York Times' stock price for figuring out its digital strategy.
The company's digital subscription revenue surged 44 percent in the nine month period ending in September.

 Cramer Remix: Amazon is the Death Star   
 8:56  PM ET Fri, 17 Nov 2017 |  01:04 
 As Amazon encroaches on nearly all aspects of retail, CNBC's Jim Cramer found himself asking a key question: ""To be Amazon'ed or not to be Amazon'ed?""
 ""It's almost eerie that one company could play such a huge role in both the economy and, yes, for Cramerica, the stock market,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""As the legendary cable operator John Malone told David Faber yesterday, Amazon is a 'death star' moving in 'striking range of every industry on the planet.'""
Yes, Amazon has seemingly unlimited capital, a laser-focused founder, CEO and proverbial ""evil emperor,"" Jeff Bezos, and a lack of exposure to the struggling brick-and-mortar landscape, rife with steep rents and crushing labor costs.
 But Cramer said that its chief driver is that the consumer loves Amazon, which, which Prime, provides the most convenient and quickest way to get practically anything.
""For now, Amazon is indeed the death star,"" Cramer concluded. ""As long as they continue to provide better goods at a better service, every conceivable competitor is right to be afraid. Be very afraid.""
 Cramer's game plan: Individual stocks drive gains

A farmer unloads harvested corn in Marshall, Missouri.
 As stocks drifted down from their highs on Friday, Cramer urged investors not to blame earnings action for the market's failure to rally.
""Even the amazing numbers and the stock moves from Foot Locker, from Ross Stores, from Gap, even from Abercrombie & Fitch, they weren't enough to prop up the averages,"" Cramer said. ""But no one ever said the stock market had to be rational, and in fact, market irrationality often gives us exactly the kinds of great opportunities I talk about because we can try to make money by going against the grain.""
Cramer said a lot of the market's moves have been mirroring overseas markets, a trend he called ""stupidity"" because foreign stocks often slide on a weakening dollar, which is a boon for U.S. companies.
""That said, while blowout earnings reports can't always save the broader market, a beat-and-raise quarter will almost always produce higher prices for the stock in question,"" Cramer said. ""It's another reason why you have to pay attention to the individual earnings reports.""
With that in mind, Cramer turned to the stocks and events he'll be watching next week, which include Lowe's, Salesforce.com and Deere.

 Applied Materials President and CEO Gary Dickerson told CNBC on Friday that ""there's never been a better time to be an investor"" in his company in its 50-year history.
""The future of competition is going to change,"" Dickerson told Cramer. ""A.I. and big data are transforming major industries. We see this in retail today, health care, transportation, many, many, many different areas. And at the foundation of that technology is Applied Materials with materials innovation.""
As companies invest in competing digitally via smart devices, better displays and streamlined service, Applied Materials, which provides key components to these products, is a direct benefactor, Dickerson said.
 What to make of Chinese IPOs?
 Brendan McDermid | Reuters
CEO Xiaochuan Wang and company Chairman Charles Zhang of China-based Sogou Inc ring the opening bell to celebrate their company's IPO at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, November 9, 2017.
 Initial public offerings seem to be coming back in style on Wall Street, so Cramer wanted to zoom in on one part of the market that caught CNBC's attention in recent weeks: Chinese IPOs.
""Now, it's not just that Chinese IPOs have been surging. According to the IPO experts at Renaissance Capital, we've had 149 deals so far in 2017, up more than 53 percent from this time last year,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""By my count, 11 of those IPOs were for Chinese companies. More important, we've gotten nine Chinese deals in just the past nine weeks.""
Six of the eleven Chinese IPOs have gone up from where their deals priced, while five have gone down. Cramer examined them all and gave his final take for homegamers.
 Owens Corning CEO on housing and hurricanes
 Owens Corning Chairman and CEO Michael Thaman told Cramer on Friday that as people spend more on their homes, one of his company's key drivers is bouncing back.
""The big news in roofing is that re-roof has come back,"" Thaman said. ""We've had all these years of very weak re-roof demand where storms were defining the marketplace. Now you've seen home equity improving, people are investing in their homes, people are putting new roofs on their house, and as a result, we're seeing that core roofing market, which is our bread and butter, really come back and sustain great performance.""
Still, storms are a major business driver, and though rebuilding in Texas inevitably slowed the supply chain at first, those disruptions are now gone — to Owens Corning's benefit.
""Once those disruptions go away, you've got to go back in and rebuild,"" the CEO said. ""Initially, they were churning out a lot of drywall, they were churning out a lot of insulation, that's got to go back in. There'll be roofs, and then we'll get new construction back on its feet in Texas as well.""
 Lightning Round: Don't overstay in these oil stocks
 In Cramer's lightning round, he zipped through his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
Kinder Morgan Inc.: ""No. No. You've got enough problems. The pipe stocks are very weak and I don't want you to buy 'em.""
Transocean Ltd.: ""I think it's got 3 or 4 [basis] points of upside, but let's not overstay our welcome because oil needs to be at $70 before they make a lot of money. $60 at least.""

 Draghi: E-commerce not depressing inflation   
 5:28  AM ET Fri, 17 Nov 2017 |  00:57 
 European Central Bank (ECB) chief Mario Draghi said Friday that there is little evidence that e-commerce is holding back inflation in the euro zone.
 There has been a debate waging among economists as to whether e-commerce giants like Amazon have had an impact on inflation in major economies in Europe and in the U.S. because of their ability to undercut bricks and mortar retailers.
But Draghi wasn't convinced online players were having a ""major effect.""
 He said during a speech Friday that an argument has been made suggesting ""structural changes due to globalization and digitalization have made it more difficult for central banks to stoke domestic inflation."" But the central banker dismissed this as a reason.
""We do not see much evidence to suggest that e-commerce is depressing inflation in the euro area today — at least to the extent that we can measure it. The same is true for 'global slack.' In fact, as the global economy recovers, the foreign output gap is moving in the same direction as the euro area output gap,"" Draghi said.
Data out Thursday confirmed that core inflation, excluding energy and food, hit 1.1 percent in October. The ECB's aim is to push it closer to 2 percent.
In his speech, Draghi said that the ECB needs to be ""patient and persistent"" for inflation to return to the bank's 2 percent target.

Commuters walk through a Wall Street subway station near the New York Stock Exchange.
 Sweeping changes are coming to several key sectors in the S&P 500 next year, with big names like Amazon and Netflix likely finding a new home.
 The changes don't take effect until September, 2018, but already Wall Street is trying to figure out what big names will will be moved around and which will affect those who own different slices of the S&P 500 through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and many mutual funds.
Late on Wednesday, the S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI jointly announced an overhaul of the Global Industry Classification system, which is how the industry divides the stock market into different sectors. The Telecommunications Services Sector will broaden out to include more internet and media stocks in a beefed-up new sector called Communication Services.
 Many argue the move to expand and rebrand was long overdue.
Traders have often complained that the telecom space is far too small to even be given its own sector. Almost two decades ago, the sector encompassed 14 companies. But after several waves of consolidation, that number has dwindled to just three names - AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink.
 The new Communication Services sector will create two sub-groups:
 Telecom, consisting of telecom, Internet, and wireless services Media & Entertainment, consisting of advertisers, broadcasters, cable/satellite providers, publishers, movie/entertainment 
This makes sense, since many Telecom companies are in the Media & Entertainment business (AT&T owns Direct TV), and internet and wireless services are indeed communication services.
David Blitzer, Chairman of the S&P Dow Jones Index Committee, acknowledged that all these mediums are beginning to intersect: ""The lines among media, communications, and content are blurred,"" Blitzer said. ""It is time to acknowledge this convergence and the overlapping services these companies provide. The Communication Services Sector addresses this progression.""
S&P won't reveal the names until January, but based on the description a lot of companies are going to migrate from Consumer Discretionary to the new Communication Services sector.
 These will likely include:
 Omnicom and Interpublic Group (advertising) News Corp (publishing) Charter, Comcast and Dish Network (cable & satellite) Time Warner, 21st Century Fox, Viacom, and Disney (movies and entertainment) CBS, Discovery and Scripps Networks (broadcasting & cable TV) 
That's a big list! S&P also says that the Internet and Direct Marketing Retail Sub-Industry and ""select"" companies in the Information Technology Sector, will also move into the Communication Services Sector.
This is huge, because it sounds like they want to put the big internet names like Amazon and Netflix, and potentially Google, into the new sector.
""The move corresponds with the changing way we communicate and access entertainment content and other information,"" ETFtrends.com proprietor Tom Lydon told me. ""This would, in turn, impact where investment money goes within the capital markets.""
What's the end result? A big shift in sector weightings. Goldman Sachs, in a note in September, forecast that the current composition of Technology, Consumer Discretionary and Telecommunications Sector would change drastically:
Information Technology
Today: 24.5 percentNew weighting: 18 percent
Consumer Discretionary
Today: 11.9 percentNew weighting: 9 percent
Telecommunication Services
Today: 1.9 percentNew weighting (as Communications Services): 10 percent
Source: Goldman Sachs
Under the new plan, technology would no longer make up a quarter of the overall S&P 500.
With some big names likely migrating out, and with roughly $20 billion indexed to the largest Technology ETF (XLK) and $12 billion indexed to the largest Consumer Discretionary ETF (XLY), you can expect a lot of money to be moved around.

Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services and Infrastructure.
 Amazon Web Services on Monday introduced cloud service for the CIA and other members of the U.S. intelligence community.
 The launch of the so-called AWS Secret Region comes six years after AWS introduced GovCloud, its first data-center region for public-sector customers. AWS has since announced plans to expand GovCloud. The new Secret Region signals interest in using AWS from specific parts of the U.S. government. 
In 2013 news outlets reported on a $600 million contract between AWS and the CIA. That event singlehandedly helped Amazon in its effort to sign up large companies to use its cloud, whose core services have been available since 2006. Today AWS counts companies such as Comcast, Hess, Intuit and Lionsgate as customers. AWS' competitors include Microsoft, Google, IBM and Oracle. 
 ""With the launch of this new Secret Region, AWS becomes the first and only commercial cloud provider to offer regions to serve government workloads across the full range of data classifications, including Unclassified, Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret,"" Amazon said in a blog post.
The new region is available to customers as a result of AWS' contract with the intelligence community's Commercial Cloud Services, or C2S, group, and it will meet certain government standards, Amazon said. But the region will also be accessible for U.S. government organizations that aren't part of the intelligence community so long as they have their own ""contract vehicles"" and sufficient secret-level network access, Amazon said.
AWS rounds out the blog post with a quote from the CIA's chief information officer, John Edwards:
 The AWS Secret Region is a key component of the Intel Community's multi-fabric cloud strategy. It will have the same material impact on the IC at the Secret level that C2S has had at Top Secret.

 });Ten years ago, paper books got some stiff competition: the first Amazon Kindle was released.
 Sunday, billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos honored the 10-year anniversary on his personal Instagram page with a photo look-back at some of the older versions.
""Ten years ago today, we launched the first-ever Kindle. Happy 10th birthday @AmazonKindle and thank you to all the Kindle readers and authors!"" Bezos wrote.
 (Click through his post, embedded below, to see additional images of old and new Kindles.)
 In the first photo, on the left is the original Kindle, and on the right is the Kindle Oasis, the most recent Kindle released on Oct. 11, 2017 which  retails for $249.99. The Kindle Paperwhite, the current best-selling version of the e-reader, is  on sale for $89.99, but typically retails for $119.99 on Amazon.

 As with virtually all technology, current prices are a whole lot cheaper than when the first much clunkier version came out a decade ago. The first Amazon Kindle retailed for $400, according to a 2007 Cnet review.
 The anniversary shout out (which Bezos cross-posted on his personal Twitter account) elicited some very nostalgic memories of the early devices and enthusiasm for the simple usefulness of the device.
""I remember the first time I was reading on my Kindle in a restaurant, the manager came up to me and said, 'What is that thing?' When I showed him what it was and what it could do (seriously, a built-in dictionary), he went back to his office to buy one. :) Congrats!""
 Tweet
 ""I still have my original Kindle displayed on my bookshelf. I carry my Kindle Oasis everywhere and love it as much as I did my first 10 years ago.""
 Tweet
 ""8 yrs ago I was treated for leukemia in France and in protective isolation for months. No paperbooks allowed but after discussion they approved a Kindle (my doctors had never seen one, had to be new and desinfected). Wouldn't have survived without one. So thank you and congrats!""
 Tweet
 In the decade since it has launched, Amazon has sold ""tens of millions"" of Kindles, according to an email from an Amazon representative to CNBC Make It.
Apple competitor to the Kindle, the iPad, launched in January, 2010. The iPad, which has more uses than the Kindle, launched at $499. In July, August and September of 2017 alone, Apple sold 10.3 million iPads, according to the company's most recent quarterly financial documents.
Though Amazon is today in the third spot behind both Apple and Samsung for total number of tablets sold, according to the most recent annual data compiled by market research firm TrendForce and published in February, Amazon has been showing strong growth in the tablet sector. ""Amazon posted a phenomenal 99.4 percent annual growth in its tablet shipments for 2016,"" TrendForce says in its written statement.

Jeff Bezos, Amazon
 Amazon is gearing up for a ""blowout"" holiday season with earnings in the fourth quarter likely to beat Wall Street expectations, one noted technology analyst said Monday.
 Daniel Ives of GBH Insights said in a research note that he believes Prime customers, those signed up to Amazon's subscription service, are estimated to spend 20 to 25 percent more this holiday season from last year. This, coupled with growth in the number of U.S. and international Prime members is ""setting the stage for a blowout holidays season,"" he said.
As a result, Amazon could beat the Street's fourth-quarter top-line estimate by 3 to 5 percent. Amazon is expected to report revenue in the three months to December of $59.7 billion, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
 Ives raised his price target on the e-commerce giant's stock from $1,185 to $1,270. That would represent a more than 12 percent rise from Friday's close. Amazon shares were up fractionally in premarket trading Monday. They are up more than 50 percent this year.
""While shares have had an eye popping run to date, we believe there is more fuel left in the tank as Amazon only appears to be in the middle innings of an unprecedented growth cycle across both the consumer and enterprise segments,"" Ives said.
The analyst said that the $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods will continue to help Amazon increase Prime membership and the cross-selling of products. Amazon has been cutting the price of Whole Foods items and integrating those products into its Prime offering. Ives called this a great ""one-two punch"" that should increase sales from Prime members for 2018 and is ""still underappreciated by the Street.""
Further investment in new areas such as health care and pharmacy will also help Amazon tap new markets, Ives said.

 Cramer Remix: Amazon is the Death Star   
 8:56  PM ET Fri, 17 Nov 2017 |  01:04 
 In the third quarter, Amazon reported earnings that beat market expectations. Other major areas investors are excited about include the continued growth of Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud division. 
Amazon is one of Wall Street's best-loved stocks with 15 strong buy ratings and 28 buy ratings, according to Reuters data. It has just three hold ratings and one sell. One potential negative point is the operating margin, which fell to 0.8 percent in the last quarter, the lowest since September 2014. This is a result of Amazon's continued investment.
But many investors appear to have shrugged this off, seeing the expenditure as necessary for Amazon to continue growing. 
And Amazon could become the first $1 trillion company, according to one investment bank. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley put forward a ""bull case"" 12-month price target of $2,000 per share for Amazon, which would put its market capitalization above $1 trillion.

People walk past the signature glass spheres under construction at the Amazon corporate headquarters on June 16, 2017 in Seattle.
 Amazon's dominance over multiple industries and markets will only get larger, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Nomura Instinet reiterated its buy rating for Amazon shares, saying the internet giant will maintain its leadership position because of its massive investment spending.
""With nearly all retailers playing defense, the few willing & able to go on the offensive have been digging ever increasing moats to take ever increasing share,"" analyst Simeon Siegel wrote in a note to clients Monday titled ""Analyzing the Forbidden: Margin Deep Dive LeavesUs w/Increased Optimism.""
 ""To this end, we took a deep dive into Amazon's margin structure, & backing into segment GMs [gross profit margins], we believe that mix shift alone could drive 1000+bps of LT GM lift, powering a $160bn investment into deepening Amazon's moat.""
Amazon shares have rallied 51 percent this year through Friday, compared with the market's 15 percent gain.
The analyst noted how the company's profit margins are expanding as it grows its more profitable businesses, such as cloud computing and the third-party marketplace seller platform. He estimates Amazon's grow margin can potentially rise to 45 to 46 percent by 2022 from an estimated 35 percent this year, enabling up to $160 billion of incremental investment spending.
Siegel increased his price target for Amazon shares to $1,360 from $1,100, representing 20 percent upside to Friday's close. The analyst's new target is the second-highest out of the 40 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet.
Amazon shares were little changed on Monday after the report.

 The Street's top 15 'anointed' stocks for 2017   
 7:06  PM ET Mon, 20 Nov 2017 |  01:17 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer always pays attention to this week, the week where major Wall Street investors ""anoint"" and buy the stock market's best performers going into the end of the year.
 ""So how does a stock qualify to become anointed? Well, first, they need to be having a great year,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Second, there has to be a long-term thesis to justify what would otherwise look like nosebleed valuations. Third, you need a belief that nothing can go wrong for the company between now and year-end.""
Portfolio managers ""anoint"" stocks because they want to show their clients they invested in the year's winning names, Cramer said.
 So Cramer went through the top 15 stocks he thinks will become ""anointed"" this year, in alphabetical order, to give homegamers a better picture of Wall Street's most wanted.
 1. Alibaba
 First on the list was Chinese e-commerce colossus Alibaba, the world's largest retailer.
""It's growing like crazy, and it just had a terrific Singles Day,"" Cramer said. ""Alibaba's stock may be up 114 percent for the year, ... but I think portfolio managers would be happy to pay even more for the top Chinese stock in a year where China again became investable.""
 2. Adobe
 With strong sales numbers and new, artificial-intelligence-based products, Adobe has completed its transition into being a pure cloud stock, Cramer said.
""While the stock's already up 76 percent for 2017, every time it comes in, buyers clamor for more,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
 3. Align Technology
 Cramer has always found Align Technology, the maker of Invisalign, to be a shoe-in for investing around the selfie generation.
""There's a ready sales force for Invisalign, and that's the hundreds of thousands of dentists who want to sell new product now that cavities are in decline — at least secular decline — thanks to improved hygiene,"" he said. ""No wonder Align's stock is up 165 percent. Even up here, it remains cheap for the momentum chasers.""
 4. Amazon
 Valuation means little to begin with when it comes to analyzing Amazon, but Cramer said the online giant is valued more on the sum of its parts.
""The thesis? Amazon's really two companies: a retailer and a web service provider. If you broke them up, the sum of the parts could be worth $1 trillion,"" he said. ""Given that Amazon currently has a market cap of $541 billion, that gives portfolio managers plenty of leeway to buy more.""
 5. Apple
 After Apple's double release of the iPhones 8 and X, Cramer doesn't see why its stock couldn't run more than the 46 percent gain it has seen so far in 2017.
""When the world's largest company has a stock that sells at merely 14 times earnings, 14 times, then you keep buying it on the way up and it won't stop being dirt cheap until it trades"" at 18 or 19 times earnings, he said.
 6. Arista Networks
 Cramer admitted that he didn't know much about Arista Networks, a cloud networking company that connects businesses to data centers. But with a 149 percent gain for the year, he said the Cisco rival seemed ""unstoppable.""
 7. Boeing
 The demand for aircraft is off the charts, so leading aircraft manufacturer Boeing is a benefactor of the surging secular growth.
""These are halcyon times for the aircraft makers,"" Cramer said. ""Boeing's run up 70 percent for the year — this is a big-cap stock — yet it is easy to justify buying it much higher.""
 8. Home Depot
 Even though Home Depot shares have only run up 27 percent for 2017, Cramer said the home improvement retailer's stock could still run higher having gone above its old all-time high.
 9. Lam Research
 Cramer attributed the relative cheapness of Lam Research's stock to people still seeing the semiconductor industry as purely cyclical rather than secular.
""This semiconductor equipment maker just keeps putting up fabulous numbers, yet it hasn't been rewarded nearly as much as it deserves given that it sells for just 14 times earnings. That's nuts, people,"" he said. ""Lam is up 103 percent. It can go much more.""
 10. 3M
 Up almost 30 percent for the year, portfolio managers might be embarrassed not owning the stock of 3M after its seriously strong earnings results in the latest quarter, Cramer said.
""This stock may be the ultimate blue chip for 2017,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
 11. Nvidia
 Investors can't ignore Nvidia's three-pronged approach to satisfying the need for high-quality semiconductor chips in the worlds of gaming, data centers and autonomous driving.
""Given that many of the institutions buying the stock simply aren't sensitive to near-term valuations, any price can be paid,"" Cramer said. ""Sky's the limit. Where this one stops, nobody knows.""
 12. PayPal
 Currently trading at $76 a share and up 92 percent for 2017, Cramer wouldn't be surprised if payment processor PayPal surpassed $100 in the near term.
 13. Square
 Having run 232 percent year-to-date, Cramer thought payment technology play Square had run out of steam.
""Now I'm thinking it might have more room to run thanks to the bitcoin initiative. People are desperate to find a bitcoin play,"" Cramer said. ""Square, by default, is now that play.""
 14. VMware
 Riding the same cloud adoption theme as Adobe, VMware, with shares up 57 percent for the year, has its hands in one of the hottest areas of the technology market, Cramer said.
 15. Wal-Mart
 Even after Goldman Sachs downgraded the big-box retailer's stock, Cramer maintained that Wal-Mart is the only company that will be able to challenge Amazon in the long term.
""That means it's going to be a must-own, which isn't bad for a stock that's up 41 percent but still trades at just 22 times earnings,"" Cramer said. ""Goldman says the stock's gotten ahead of itself. Oh, perfect. All of these stocks are technically ahead of themselves, but that's precisely what gets them anointed.""
 Final Thoughts
 ""In a perfect world, I'd like to wait for a pullback ... to tell you to buy any one of these red-hot names,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""But at this time of year, it's very unlikely you'll get a pullback in the anointed winners, as hedge fund buyers can't get enough of them. But if by some fluke, by some chance, any of these names dips, well, you should jump all over them.""

 Malone interview makes Cramer more bullish on Netflix and Amazon   
 7:07  PM ET Mon, 20 Nov 2017 |  01:28 
 It's rare for CNBC's Jim Cramer to see an interview that ""rocks [his] whole investment world,"" but David Faber's interview with Liberty Media Chairman John Malone last week did just that.
 ""Rarely do you come across an executive who's so comfortable in his own skin that he can speak his mind about so many different companies,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Most execs insist they can only speak about their own businesses — they don't want to step on anyone else's toes.""
But Malone isn't one of those executives, and he proved it by drawing the now-pervasive comparison between Amazon and the Death Star, the evil Empire's battle station in the ""Star Wars"" franchise that had the power to destroy entire planets.
 By using scale, reduced cost and heightened convenience to reach consumers, Amazon is moving ""into striking range of every industry on the planet,"" Malone said on Thursday.
Judging by the scramble among pharmacy operators after Amazon expressed interest in entering the drug retail business, Cramer thought Malone was spot-on.
And to Malone, scale — particularly the kind built on artificial intelligence and fueled by the stock market — will propel the success of giants like Amazon and Netflix in the future.
Backed by money from the market and major film studios, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings has developed an international platform that uses AI and price controls to satisfy consumers while giving directors more free will than traditional studios.
""It's a built-in edge that puts Netflix on the path to world domination,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Netflix will beat anyone trying to scale. They've got the directors willing to work for them. And that's why Malone said 'it's way too late' for the cable companies to band together to stop Netflix.""
That got Cramer thinking about Netflix's $83 billion valuation, a far cry from CBS Corporation's $22 billion valuation or Twenty-First Century Fox's $57 billion.
While Cramer could argue that both CBS and Fox still have hidden value that could be unlocked by takeover bids, he was more taken by what Netflix may still have to offer.
""If anything, $83 billion seems too small a valuation for Netflix. Do we really think an international content distribution company with local artificial intelligence and the ability to make its own AI-driven programming should only be worth $83 billion?"" Cramer wondered. ""I could make a compelling case that this worldwide operator ought to be worth a lot more.""
All in all, Malone's comments about Amazon and Netflix (and the echoes that followed) made Cramer even more bullish on the two companies' power to defeat any rival with scale, better information and AI.
""Amazon and Netflix are like Big Brother — they know you better than you know yourself. How can anyone beat that?"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""After watching that interview with Malone, I've gotta tell you that, if anything, I think Netflix's stock is cheap at these levels and I think it can go higher. Maybe much higher.""

Anne Wojcicki, chief executive officer and co-founder of 23andMe Inc., speaks during the WSJDLive Global Technology Conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S., on Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016.
 As if Amazon hadn't become a big enough part of our lives, the website is now increasingly the place people are going to find if they're of African heritage or if their children are at risk for certain rare genetic conditions.
 DNA-testing companies that offer everything from ancestry information to tests for common inherited diseases are projecting record sales over the holiday season, with Amazon serving as a new marketplace for many of them. 
Ancestry, 23andMe and dozens of other genetics companies all started selling on Amazon in the ""home tests"" category in the past year or two, with the bigger players working closely with Amazon to make that happen.
 Among the first to initiate sales on the website was Ancestry, which started offering a DNA test for lineage and family connections through the marketplace in 2015. At that time, the company was selling 400 to 500 sets a day, a number that swelled to close to 1,300 a day by late 2016, said Vineet Mehra, Ancestry's chief marketing officer. 
It's proved to be a larger-than-expected chunk of sales for Ancestry, which directs the bulk of its marketing and advertising to its own site.

 Mehra said the Amazon channel has grown from being virtually negligible in 2015 to represent about 5 percent to 10 percent of overall sales. He expects sales via Amazon to jump further in 2017, but he declined to share figures.   
The company has sold more than 6 million tests for $79 apiece (recently down from $99).
Amazon featured Ancestry and chief rival 23andMe on Prime Day, prompting a spike in sales. They could get another boon in the next week, thanks to Black Friday and Cyber Monday. 
23andMe declined to provide a breakdown of its sales on Amazon. Helix, another large genetic-testing company, also declined to share numbers since many of its health tests were only made available on Amazon in the past few days, said CEO Robin Thurston.
 'Valuable consumer insights'
 For Amazon, these health tests are a growing slice of its burgeoning medical supplies and equipment business.
It has also offered a way for the company to roll out health products, like cancer risk tests from Color Genomics, that require a doctor's prescription. Last November, Good Start Genetics was the first to partner with Amazon to sell home tests that tell would-be parents the potential genetic risks facing their kids. CNBC reported this year that Amazon has been mulling a move into the prescription business.
Products from Ancestry don't require a doctor's note and can be offered to Amazon Prime customers. According to Mehra, it's also an opportunity to reach an entirely new base of customers, who typically purchase only consumer products on Amazon. 
23andMe sees Amazon as an opportunity to learn more about its own customers.
""Amazon provides us with valuable consumer insights, promotional opportunities and best-in-class logistics,"" 23andMe vice president Jon Ward said in an e-mailed statement to CNBC. ""We hope to expand our relationship with Amazon in the coming years.""

Pedestrians walk past a Rite Aid Corp. store in Oakland, California.
 Amazon should acquire Rite Aid to obtain state pharmacy licenses and add a regulatory-cleared infrastructure, according to one Wall Street analyst on Tuesday.
 If Amazon were to launch pharmacies in Whole Foods, on Prime and Prime Now, an acquisition of Rite Aid would accelerate market share gains, according to Cowen analyst John Blackledge.
Both Amazon and Rite Aid offered no comment for this story. Shares of Rite Aid were up more than 5 percent late morning Tuesday after the Cowen report.
 The deal suggestion was part of a larger report by Blackledge on why Amazon should get into the business of selling prescription drugs. The e-commerce giant has been quietly exploring ways to expand into the health-care industry. CNBC reported in May that Amazon has been recruiting health insurance experts to develop an internal pharmacy benefits manager for Amazon employees.
""Our Cowen proprietary survey data suggests 67 percent of Amazon Prime members would purchase prescription drugs through Amazon if they were available,"" wrote Blackledge. ""Depending on the pace Amazon would seek to enter the market, an acquisition such as Rite Aid could accelerate the pace and be a relatively low-risk acquisition given that it currently trades at an enterprise value of only about $5 billion.""
If an Amazon-Rite Aid deal were to materialize, the analyst argues that Amazon's U.S. retail pharmacy business could generate about $20 billion in 2019 with 10 percent market share. Amazon would inherit pharmacy licenses in 19 states as well as adopt six distribution centers and 2,575 regulatory-cleared stores, a sizable leg up for the e-commerce giant.
Many Wall Street strategists view the recent CVS-Aetna merger talks as evidence that some of the industry's major players are also wary of Amazon's ambitions in the space. If Amazon entered the pharmacy benefit manager space, Amazon could serve as its own mail-order drug business.
""We think Amazon could enter the pharmacy benefit manager business (PBM),"" added Blackledge. ""A simple case one can make for Amazon to enter the PBM space is that it can serve as its own mail pharmacy, and capitalize on Prime 2-day delivery. From there, Amazon could build out its own retail network, and find itself working with other retail pharmacy chains to participate in its retail network.""
Earlier this year drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance ditched its deal to buy Rite Aid after struggling to win antitrust approval.
Instead, Walgreens received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to buy 1,932 stores from Rite Aid for $4.38 billion.

Shoppers line up to pay for their merchandise at a checkout counter in a Target store.
 The retailers that are being crushed by Amazon have rallied in the past two weeks ahead of the holiday shopping period, but if history is a guide, they could underperform again after Thanksgiving.
 Bespoke Investment Group's ""Death by Amazon"" index includes 62 brick-and-mortar retailers whose businesses have been hurt by Amazon and internet shopping. Since its peak in September 2015, the index has lost a third of its value, and it has declined by 15 percent this year alone, while the S&P 500 is up 15 percent.
 But so far this month, retail stocks have bounced with the XRT, SPDR S&P Retail ETF, up 5.3 percent, while the S&P 500 is up just 0.9 percent. In the same period, Amazon is up 3 percent.
""The retail stocks have done great this month,"" said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. ""I don't think necessarily people are going to start changing their habits, going back to brick-and-mortar this holiday season. … The only argument you can make in their favor is they're down so much.""
Since 2000, the S&P retail sector on average has underperformed the broader market from Thanksgiving through year end. The median move has been a 0.4 percent gain, compared with the 1.5 percent move in the S&P 500.
Amazon in the same period has been up 70 percent of the time with a median move of 1 percent, since 2000.
Hickey said Apple's new iPhone X could steal some of the gift-shopping business from retail this year. ""I think Amazon will still have a pretty good year ... but if it's anyone, it's the traditional retailers that could have the most headwinds,"" said Hickey.
Among the stocks in the Death by Amazon index are Macy's, Kohl's, TJX, Ulta, Wal-Mart, Williams-Sonoma, Bed Bath and Beyond, Big Lots, CVS, Costco Wholesale, Foot Locker, Fred's, Target GNC Holdings, J.C. Penney, Nordstrom, Kroger and Sears Holdings.

 Jim Cramer: It drives me 'crazy' DOJ is looking at AT&T deal in a static way   
 7:52  PM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 |  00:31 
 The government is myopic in its argument against the AT&T-Time Warner merger and doesn't comprehend the significant competitive threat from internet disruptors in the digital age.The Justice Department sued on Monday to block AT&T's merger with Time Warner, saying the deal will ""substantially lessen competition, resulting in higher prices and less innovation for millions of Americans.""
 AT&T announced an agreement to acquire Time Warner in October 2016 for a cash and stock deal valued at more than $85 billion.The crux of the government's case is AT&T will be able to leverage the power of Time Warner's content such as HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" and sports programming on TBS to raise pricing or gain subscribers at the expense of its competitors.But the DOJ's complaint fails to mention how AT&T is aggressively pricing its own innovative DirecTV Now internet TV streaming service, which cannibalizes its own satellite TV business. Consumers of the service have already received significant value ranging from free Apple TV boxes to cheaper HBO subscriptions.

DirectTV Now signage in the AT&T Vulture Lounge during the 2017 Vulture Festival at Highline Stages on May 21, 2017 in New York City.
 The internet television streaming service market is also currently booming. Consumers now have more choice and flexibility than ever before. Along with AT&T's DirecTV Now, there are well-funded other offerings such as Google's YouTube TV, Dish Network's Sling TV, Sony's PlayStation Vue and Hulu Live TV in the marketplace. 
 In addition, Disney announced plans in August to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018.
""You could not have a more vibrant competitive landscape than we have today and if anything this merger is going to cause people's cable bills or their TV bills to go down,"" AT&T outside counsel Dan Petrocelli told CNBC on Tuesday.
In fact, AT&T may be pursuing the deal from a position of weakness not strength. CEO Randall Stephenson described the competitive threat from the internet giants during the company's press conference Monday.
 ""Massive large-scale internet companies with market caps in the hundreds of billions of dollars are creating tons of original content and distributing it directly to the consumer. This is disrupting both industries, media and as well as the communications industry."" 
He cited how Netflix has more than 100 million subscribers and Amazon has an estimated 60 million Prime members. In addition, Stephenson noted Google and Facebook are now reaching billions of users.
In comparison the DOJ cited how AT&T has more than 25 million video subscribers across its television services in its lawsuit.
Even legendary cable industry deal-maker John Malone said his industry would not be able to catch up to Netflix due to the company's lead in size and large subscriber base.
The internet ""makes scale even more important in the media business, where scale always was important. It's all about scale,"" he said on Nov. 16. The billionaire investor noted the cable industry missed its opportunity to compete with Netflix in the past and said ""it's way too late"" now.
DOJ also seems to overstate the competitive moat for Time Warner's businesses.
Is ""Game of Thrones"" that different than what Netflix has been able to create with its original content offerings? No.
Does TBS have an irreplaceable advantage in its live sports offerings when Amazon, Facebook and Google are now bidding for the sports broadcasting rights with their massive balance sheets and distribution platforms? No.The government should look at the stock market's verdict on where the power resides and not risk interfering with the free-market's competitive dynamics.
AT&T stock has declined 19 percent year to date through Monday, while Time Warner shares have fallen 9 percent. The S&P 500 is up 15 percent in the same time period.
In contrast, Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet and Netflix shares are up 50 percent, up 55 percent, up 31 percent and up 57 percent, respectively.

 As Amazon expands its empire, tech investor Roger McNamee reveals what we can expect next   
 5:39  PM ET Wed, 22 Nov 2017 |  05:22 
 Amazon is not just disrupting industries, it is single-handedly disrupting the whole economy, according to Elevation Partners co-founder Roger McNamee. 
 The investor, in his appearance on CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Wednesday, was commenting on the apparent deal between Amazon's cloud business and Cerner, one of the world's biggest health tech companies. Amazon has been looking for a way into the health-care industry. 
McNamee said he sees this move as a ""typical Amazon"" approach to the type of disruption it is causing in virtually every industry. 
 ""Any industry that has been reluctant to adopt cloud services has been at risk for being disrupted by amazon,"" McNamee said. ""Health care is one of the places where the cloud has had much less impact than it could have or should have.""
Much of Amazon's success, McNamee argued, comes from the company's robust and expanding cloud services. In addition to its health investments, Amazon Web Services looks to expand into the public sector, announcing plans for a group of cloud data centers for the U.S. intelligence communityMonday. 
""The reality is that Amazon is the world's most successful player in cloud services. And any industry that has been reluctant to adopt cloud services has been at risk for being disrupted by amazon,"" he said.
Health care may not be a huge money-maker straight away, but if Amazon's success in other industries is any indicator, McNamee anticipates AWS' partnership with Cerner will be a good start.
""In each market in which they operate, [Amazon has] changed the rules profoundly. It makes it really hard for competitors to fight back, they are effectively playing a different game,"" he said.
While health care looks like the next big target on Amazon's cloud disruption list, McNamee thinks streamlining retail and perishable food distribution will bring the company its biggest value over the short term, especially as traditional retailers struggle.
""There are just too many square feet of retail space and it is allocated in a way that inevitably is going to have lots of losers,"" McNamee said.

 Heading into Thanksgiving, Dow and S&P 500 fall, Nasdaq rises   
 5:24  PM ET Wed, 22 Nov 2017 |  01:05 
 The Nasdaq composite eked out a record close on Wednesday, led by gains in Amazon.
 The tech-heavy index closed 0.1 percent higher at 6,867.36 as Amazon gained more than 1 percent. Amazon shares rose after CNBC reported the company's cloud business is about to announce a huge health-care deal with Cerner, one of the largest health technology companies in the world.
The Nasdaq has now posted record closes in back-to-back sessions; it also hit an intraday high on Wednesday.
 The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, finished lower after Federal Reserve expresses concern about the impact of the market's sharp rise on the economy in a summary of its previous meeting.
The Dow declined 64.65 points to close at 23,526.18, with DowDuPont declining 0.9 percent to lead decliners.
The S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent to 2,597.08, with financials and real estate as the worst-performing sectors. HP Enterprise was the worst-performing stock in the index.

 The minutes from the Fed's Oct. 31-Nov. 1 meeting showed the central bank's officials have started to worry that market prices are getting out of hand and are posing a danger to the economy.
""I think the Fed is torn here,"" said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab. ""They want to raise interest rates and they are concerned that if asset prices keep going higher, they could get bubbly and burst. But at the same time, they can't get inflation to go up.""
Some members feared what would happen if the market suddenly took a hit.
""In light of elevated asset valuations and low financial market volatility, several participants expressed concerns about a potential buildup of financial imbalances,"" the minutes stated.
Equities have been on fire this year, with the S&P 500 rising more than 15 percent and volatility remaining subdued.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
 Losses on the Dow and S&P 500 were muted by strong corporate earnings. Tractor maker Deere reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. The company's stock jumped 4.3 percent. Deere also issued strong earnings guidance for the coming fiscal year.
HP Enterprise on Tuesday also reported better-than-expected sales and earnings, but its stock fell more than 7 percent after CEO Meg Whitman announced she will step down from her role early next year.
Salesforce and Gamestop's earnings also topped analyst expectations.
Overall, this earnings season has been solid. With 97.8 percent of the S&P 500 having reported, calendar third-quarter earnings are up 6.25 percent on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet. Also, about 74 percent of companies have posted earnings that have surpassed expectations.
The three major indexes closed at record highs on Tuesday, led by a sharp rally in tech stocks.
""New highs were the undeniable theme once again on Tuesday,"" said Frank Cappelleri, executive director at Instinet, in a note to clients. ""It happened for the S&P 500 and for many, many other indices, ETFs and stocks. Broad participation and a proliferation of uptrends have helped this remain the case all year.""
On the data front, durable goods orders fell 1.2 percent in October; economists polled by Reuters expected a 0.3 percent increase. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims hit 239,000, just below an estimate of 240,000.

 The best investment Tony Robbins ever made cost him $35 at age 17

 ""The larger the pink circle, the more your investment is worth,"" according to How Much. ""If the pink fits inside the blue, then you lost money. The [graphic] assumes that you took any dividend paid out in cash and did not reinvest into the company by buying more stock.""
These companies largely proved to be good investments. ""All things being equal, prices seem pretty high right now. In fact, most of the companies on our chart have seen significant gains in recent years,"" the report states.
But there are cautionary tales to be seen in the chart, too, since any individual stock can either over- or under-perform. That's why so many experts suggest that, to get started in the stock market, you consider index funds, which hold every stock in an index such as the S&P 500, including big-name companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Google, and offer low turnover rates, so the attendant fees and tax bills tend to be low as well.
Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins all agree index funds are a safe bet, especially for new investors, since they fluctuate with the market, stay pretty constant and eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.
Investing for the first time can be a big step, and it can be risky. Past returns do not predict future results. But if you find the right stocks, it can lead to a real pay off.

 CNBC will walk you through the differences between Amazon's different Echo products, from the Echo Dot to the Echo Spot, so you know what each one offers and what will fit your lifestyle the best.
Here's a quick rundown of each Echo and what they do.
 Echo Dot
 Amazon
 The Echo Dot is the most affordable of the Echo family and is the best bet for folks who aren't sure if they want to spend more. It offers a speaker and almost all of the functionality of the other Echo products, just in a slim package. You can use it for all tasks, from placing phone calls to playing music around the house.
 The Echo 
 Todd Haselton | CNBC
I love the oak shell that was sent with my demo unit
 The new Echo replaces the original towering Echo and costs $99, down from the original price of $179. Amazon improved the audio quality of this model, and it's the one I think most people should buy. You can outfit it with different shells to match your decor, and it's a great solution for full-sounding music if you plan to place them around your house for multiroom music. Read our Echo review for more information.
 The Echo Plus
 Todd Haselton | CNBC
The Echo Plus sounds better than the original, too
 The Echo Plus is Amazon's most high-end Echo speaker and includes most of what you need to start a smart home. With it, you can start buying Philips Hue bulbs and other products without the need for a stand-alone hub (which you'd need if you bought any other Echo). It can automatically detect your smart home products, with support for light switches, smart locks, sprinklers, thermostats and more. If you're not interested in creating a smart home, choose the regular Echo. Read our Echo Plus review for more information.
 The Echo Spot
 Amazon
The Echo Spot is like a smaller Echo Show
 The $129.99 Echo Spot is launching in December and is Amazon's second Echo to sport a touch-screen display. This can be used for anything from viewing photos to seeing the lyrics of a song that's playing. Given its compact size, it can also double as a smart alarm clock right next to your bedstand. It has speakers, though they're not as large as those found in the Echo or Echo Plus, so expect audio that's on a par with the Echo Dot. Like other Echos, it lets you place calls, check the weather, order goods from Amazon and more, though it also lets you watch video from Amazon Prime.
 The Echo Show
 Todd Haselton | CNBC
 The Echo Show is my favorite Echo of the entire family, since it has a nice large display that can be used for video calls, placing orders from Amazon — just ask to order soap and Alexa will show you various products available to order. Tap one and it's on the way. It also has decent-sounding speakers since it's larger than the Echo Spot, and can be used to play music, show song lyrics and more. It's also the most expensive Echo at $229. Read our Echo Show review for more information.
 The Echo Look
 Amazon
 The Echo Look is the weirdest Echo of the bunch. It's a hands-free camera and style assistant that costs $199.99 and is meant to sit in your bedroom or closet. It'll take pictures of you and each outfit you wear, allowing you to view your favorite styles, discover new clothes, get a ""second opinion with Style Check"" which uses machine learning to analyze your outfit selection and more. You can also tap into Alexa, in case you want to play music or check your calendar while you're getting dressed.

 Small-business owners generated $15.4 billion in revenue on Small Business Saturday in 2016, according to insights from a survey commissioned by American Express, a number that's been on the rise for years. About 112 million people went out to shop on Small Business Saturday last year. And more than 480 organizations joined the Small Business Coalition.
The shopping holiday, sandwiched between big retail, favoring Black Friday and Cyber Monday, was founded in 2010 by American Express to benefit America's small businesses, hurting from the economic recession of the last decade.

 Amazon could buy Kohl's with 'pocket change': Jan Kniffen   
 8:21  AM ET Fri, 24 Nov 2017 |  01:52 
 ""I keep saying Amazon should buy Kohl's,"" Jan Kniffen, a retail consultant and former retail executive, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Friday morning.
 ""It's a very simple reason,"" Kniffen said. ""It [would give Amazon] a nice little halo.""
Kohl's roughly 1,100 department stores across the country — most of which are only one level, are detached from malls and have plenty of parking space — would help grow the internet giant's physical footprint, he said.
 Earlier this year, Kohl's kicked off a partnership with Amazon, where it now sells some of Amazon's tech gadgets and accepts Amazon returns at a handful of stores.
The Wisconsin-based department store chain has quietly been working on an alliance with Amazon since the spring, Kohl's chief merchandising and customer officer, Michelle Gass, told CNBC when the partnership went live. Gass will be succeeding Kohl's CEO Kevin Mansell in May, when he retires. 
""We've got a really simple objective ... to improve traffic in our stores,"" Mansell told CNBC Wednesday about the relationship. ""The objective right now is to improve traffic, which would lead to an expansion of the program.""
Mansell wouldn't comment on Amazon acquiring Kohl's.
The ""early indications"" from the Amazon pilot, which is only a few weeks in, are ""very positive,"" Mansell said.
Amazon should outright own Kohl's, as it would give the company a place to sell and store merchandise, and accept returns, Kniffen said. This opinion is held by other retail industry analysts. 
""Four hundred Whole Foods stores isn't going to do that for them,"" he said. And Kohl's $7.5 billion market capitalization would only be ""pocket change"" for Amazon.

An employee walks over a logo at an Amazon.com fulfillment center.
 A fake advertisement that looked like a legitimate link to Amazon was visible in Google search results on Thursday, just ahead of the Black Friday shopping frenzy.
 The advertisement, first spotted by CBS News, appeared if a user typed ""Amazon"" into Google Search. It looked like a normal ad but, when clicked, it routed users to a Facebook page and tried to trick users into thinking their computer might be infected with malware.
A message that appeared to be an official notification from Microsoft then suggested that a user's financial data may have been compromised and to call a support number.
 CBS said scammers answered the faux support number and claimed to work for Microsoft before asking for $150 to rid the computer of a virus that didn't exist. People who may have fallen for this scheme could have put their personal information, including credit card numbers, at risk.
Microsoft doesn't ask for this sort of information over the phone.
""We do not send unsolicited email messages or make unsolicited phone calls to request personal or financial information or fix your computer,"" Microsoft's privacy page says. ""If you receive an unsolicited email message or phone call that purports to be from Microsoft and requests that you send personal information or click links, delete the message or hang up the phone.""
A Google spokesperson told CNBC that the ad was an ""abuse of our platform.""
""We strictly prohibit advertising of illegal activity and have removed these ads and suspended the account,"" the spokesperson said. ""When we find ads that violate our policies, we take immediate action to disable the offending sources.""

 });The Instant Pot — a seemingly magical multi-cooker — has grabbed the attention of Amazon shoppers and food fanatics around the world. Behind the product is CEO and founder Robert Wang, who has built the business with little marketing and an obsession with improving the product. 
 Wang, who has a PhD in computer science with a specialty in artificial intelligence, keeps three Instant Pots running at his house at all times, and he's read almost all of the reviews on Amazon — that's more than 39,000 for the most popular DUO60 6 Qt 7-in-1 Multi-Use Programmable model alone.
""I try to read every single one,"" he tells CNBC Make It.

 Users of the fast and convenient pot — which functions as both a pressure cooker (cooking things rapidly by trapping steam) and a slow cooker (heating food low and slow) — are just as obsessed as Wang.
On Amazon, they compulsively post reviews that mark their devotion to the gadgets, which can also be used as a rice cooker, yogurt maker, sauté/browning pan, steamer and warming pot.

 ""This device has changed the way I cook! LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!"" writes one reviewer; ""This has transformed meal preparation in our house,"" says another.
The praise continues in the Instant Pot's Facebook group, which has over 750,000 members. The group gained more than 10,000 members in 30 days from mid-October through mid-November, and can see as many as 7,000 posts each day. On the page, users exchange recipes, tips, tricks and, of course, rave reviews.
Fans also take to Instagram and Pinterest.

 Reviewers on these platforms include regular people, as well as bloggers — some of whom have been gifted the cooker to test out.
Shelley Moser, a mom of three girls in North Carolina, tells CNBC that she simultaneously uses two Instant Pots to cook things like rice and beef with broccoli. ""I'm hooked. It's like a whole other world opens up,"" she says.
Moser bought her Instant Pot on Amazon's Prime Day and she is certainly not alone. The annual promotion by the e-commerce giant brings landslide sales to Double Insight, Wang's Ottawa, Canada-based company. In 2016, 215,000 Instant Pot 7-in-1 Multi-Functional Pressure Cookers were sold on Prime Day. This year, Instant Pot topped the Prime Day Best Sellers list again for both the U.S. and Canada.
Instant Pots, which cost about $50 to $150, depending on retailer and model, are also a bestseller during the holidays. Wang says that on Black Friday and Cyber Monday last year, Instant Pots far outsold Prime Day. And according to Amazon, the 6-quart Instant Pot 7-in-1 Multi-Functional Pressure Cooker was a top-three bestselling kitchen product during that time.
This Black Friday, Instant Pots were a best-selling item at Kohl's, CEO Kevin Mansell tells CNBC, selling out by Friday morning. CNBC reports J.C. Penney was sold out too, while Target and Wal-Mart appeared to keep it in stock through the afternoon.
 A post shared by Golden Apron_debc (@mygoldenapron) on Nov 20, 2017 at 8:51pm PST 
 Wang declines to give numbers for overall Instant Pot sales, but says ""We've been more than doubling year-over-year from 2011,"" in both revenue and unit sales.
Indeed, Instant Pot is a leader in the multi-cooker category, ""which grew 56 percent in the last year and 85 percent the year before. Over the last three years, about 5 million units have been sold,"" according to NPD stats reported by CNBC.
For Wang, the demand highlights a growing consumer need for quick healthy dinners. Like many Instant Pot customers, Wang uses his three Instant Pots to make meals for his busy family.
""For example in the morning, my daughter needs to have an egg to get started, and she is really picky regarding eggs,"" he says. ""She wants a soft-boiled egg with a runny yolk inside and the whites well-cooked.""
So, he turns to the Instant Pot. Other family favorites include porridge with beans, ribs and sweet corn on the cob.
 A history of convenience 
 Slow-cooked dinners bubbling away while home-cooks are at work is nothing new.
The Crock-Pot was invented over 75 years ago, when Irving Nachumsohn received a patent for a very early version of the device in 1940. It surged to popularity in the 1970s as women began broadly entering the work force, according to the Washington Post. An advertisement for Crock-Pots in Sept. 25, 1975 ran in the Post and argued the product was ""perfect for working women."" 
A study by Carnegie Mellon University found that household appliances (like Crock-Pots) accounted for about 40 percent of the increase in married women heading to work during the 1960s, the Post points out.
And, the low energy aspect of Crock-Pots became crucial for households during the oil and energy crisis in the 1970s. ""While women may have fallen in love with the Crock-pot for the convenience it afforded, America fell in love with it for the money it saved,"" Cnet reports.
Wang cites the invention of the first rice cookers as even earlier in the 20th century, and a pressurized cooking pot was made in the 17th century by the French physicist Denis Papin, according to The New York Times.
But Wang's business is centered on the idea that those products haven't kept up with the times.
""Our parents and our grandmothers lived a very different life,"" he says. ""Those legacy appliances haven't evolved that much to cater to the needs of our generation.""
So, Wang decided to make something different.
 The invention
 In 2008, Wang was working at a mobile messaging company that he co-founded, but as the economy turned down, the venture became harder to pursue.
""I realized that it is difficult to continue on building high-tech companies because it was almost impossible to get funding,"" he says.
So Wang and two friends began to brainstorm other business ideas and noticed they all struggled to cook healthy dinners while balancing work and kids.
""We did lots of takeout, fast food, and we know that is not good enough for our children,"" he says. ""So that is why we were thinking, 'What if there is a machine which is smart enough, which can automate the entire cooking process for us, so that we can fix dinner when we come back from work.'""
Enter, the Instant Pot.
In 2009, they founded the company and launched their first product in October of 2010 on Amazon. (Since then, Wang has brought on new partners.) During that time, the focus was inventing the best product possible.
""We have done lots of experiments, my partners and myself have done a lot of cooking,"" Wang says. ""This is more that just eating our own dog food. It is like force-feeding dog food.""
When they started selling their first version, ""The first batch of customers were family and friends,"" he admits. 
Then word spread. ""So after the first generation of product, we gathered enough feedback to make modifications,"" says Wang.
The company added features like burn protection and the cooker started to take off. Wang cites the tipping point as January 2013, when the company's second-generation Instant Pot initially became the bestseller in the pressure cooker category on Amazon. 
""I realized we had captured the imagination of the public,"" he says.
Today there are more than 10 versions of the Instant Pot on its website, and it can be found in at a slew of retailers like Williams Sonoma, Target and Best Buy. The expansion is largely due to word of mouth.
""To be honest with you, we haven't spent much money on advertising,"" Wang says. ""In fact, that is not part of the business plan. We really spend money on product development and customer support.""
 The reinvention
 While the product is constantly praised online, Wang is scanning the reviews not for an ego boost but for ideas. In fact, he pays the closest attention to critiques. That is where innovation stems from. 
""Those are the reviews that will point out the short comings of the product and give us insight to improve the products,"" he says. ""Every 12 months to 18 months, we introduce the next generation of Instant Pot incorporating feedback from our real customers,"" Wang says.
The idea of re-iteration is something he picked up while working for phone companies.
""I draw lots of experience from my telecom days,"" Wang says. He watched phones transform from bricks that could only make calls and send texts to the smart devices they are now. A key contributor to the improvement in phones was engineers adding more sensors. Wang wants to further cooking appliances the same way.
""So that is what we want to do, to add additional sensors in the legacy appliances so that they can be smarter, cooking more delicious food consistently,"" he explains.
For Wang, the craze around his product has been a surprise. His plan was just to make a better way to eat dinner.
""We actually didn't expect it to come this fast. When we started, we aimed to solve some key problems for people in their daily life,"" he says.  
""It turned out that if you build a good product, people see the value of it and they will jump onto it.""

Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy at a 2017 event in San Francisco.
 Amazon's cloud division is gearing up for its biggest event of the year, when customers and developers descend on Las Vegas for re:Invent.
 At the sixth annual re:Invent next week, Amazon Web Services executives are expected to announce new tools and share the stage with representatives from big companies who will tout their AWS usage.
AWS is the clear market leader in cloud infrastructure, but Google and Microsoft are growing faster and picking up marquee clients. To stay on top, AWS has to not only offer competitive prices and continue to expand geographically but also introduce new services built and operated by top-tier engineers.
 Unlike developer events from Apple, Google and Microsoft, re:Invent is known to feature some surprises. But we already have a good idea of some of the things on the agenda. Here's what you should expect at re:Invent 2017.
 A bigger partnership with health tech company Cerner
 CNBC reported on Wednesday that AWS and health IT company Cerner are planning to talk about how they're working together more closely, initially around a Cerner product called HealtheIntent. The health-care industry is a huge potential market that's so far been slow to adopt the cloud.
 A language translation tool
 Like Google and Microsoft, AWS sees artificial intelligence as a growth opportunity. Earlier this week AWS gave customers an AI tool for recognizing tech in images -- technology that Microsoft and Google both introduced previously. Amazon has also been working on technology that translates text from one language to another, and the AWS division might well introduce a cloud-managed machine translation service for use by anyone.  
 AI services
 AWS talks a lot about AI services and may be readying a general-purpose system for a trendy type of AI called deep learning, which involves training computers on lots of data, such as pictures, to make predictions. While Amazon's preferred open-source library for deep learning, MXNet, will likely play a prominent role in the service, AWS also appears interested in making it easier to use Google's TensorFlow on its cloud. Beyond that, AWS could discuss a data warehouse service for storing data that's intended for neural network training.
 More Kubernetes support
 People typically use Amazon's computing power by packaging up their code inside virtual machines, many of which can run on a single physical server in an AWS data center. Recently, some developers have also started to use an alternative technology called containers, which can provide performance and efficiency benefits. Google has an open-source product called Kubernetes that's become popular for managing the deployment of containers across multiple servers. Amazon is expected to provide better support for Kubernetes.
 A bare metal service
 IBM and Oracle, which lag behind Amazon, Google and Microsoft in the public cloud infrastructure market, have sought to differentiate themselves by providing bare metal servers. They're unconstrained by the software that enables virtual machines and can result in better performance for some computing tasks. We've heard rumblings that AWS has been working on a competing bare metal service.
 A stronger emphasis on data and serverless technology
 Andy Jassy, the CEO of AWS, indicated earlier this week that Amazon's technology chief Werner Vogels will be up to something a little different this year. Rather than announcing a string of new services during his keynote, Vogels will focus on data and serverless technology, or software that's programmed to perform tasks when certain events happen. AWS got people talking about serverless technology in 2014, when it introduced Lambda. 
CNBC's Jon Fortt has an exclusive interview with AWS CEO Andy Jassy from Amazon's AWS re:Invent. It will air at 11 a.m. ET Wednesday on Squawk Alley.

People walk past the signature glass spheres under construction at the Amazon corporate headquarters on June 16, 2017 in Seattle.
 Retail giant Amazon has a rather mixed reputation among progressives, to say the least. There are ongoing debates about its labor practices and its  ruthless competitive tactics, which have driven competitor after competitor out of business. Among environmentalists, opinion is also divided — some argue that online shopping (and shipping) has accelerated wasteful consumer culture, others that it has reduced the carbon footprint of shopping that was going to happen anyway.
Putting those broader disputes aside, there is one area where the company is making substantial and undeniable progress. After years of what could charitably be called benign neglect, Amazon has recently moved aggressively toward corporate sustainability.
 It plans to have 15 rooftop solar systems, with a total capacity of around 41 MW, deployed atop fulfillment centers by the end of this year, with plans to have 50 such systems installed by 2020.
 Amazon was the lead corporate purchaser of green energy in 2016. That year, it also announced its largest wind energy project to date, the 253 MW Amazon Wind Farm Texas. Overall, the company says, it has ""announced or commenced construction on wind and solar projects that will generate a total of 3.6 million megawatt hours (MWh) of renewable energy annually.""
(Of particular interest to Vox nerds: The company also signed on to an  amicus brief in support of Clean Power Plan, Obama's signature climate policy, which the Trump administration  wants to kill.)
More from Vox: The world's largest car market just announced an imminent end to gas and diesel car  How free porn enriched the tech industry — and ruined the lives of actors  Genetically engineered humans will arrive sooner than you think. And we're not ready. 
But what recently caught my eye is the clever way that Amazon's giant new campus in downtown Seattle will keep its occupants warm in the winter — a pleasingly low-tech solution that sits squarely at the intersection of several of my enduring obsessions: the importance of smart design, the benefits of urban density, and the need for electrification of the power system.
Juicy! Let's take a look.
 Hot water is so hot right now
 Amazon is building a giant four-block campus in downtown Seattle's Denny Triangle, which will eventually encompass five towers and five million square feet. This schematic is from  Geekwire (which has its own  excellent story on Amazon's project).
That's a lot of space to heat during the dreary Pacific Northwest winters.
Good fortune! Just across 6th Avenue from Doppler Tower is the 34-story Westin Building Exchange, a regional telecom ""carrier hotel"" that houses computer and server hardware for some 250 telecom and internet companies. About 70 percent of the building is occupied by data centers.
All that hardware creates an enormous amount of heat. Lacking any better options, Westin has been venting that heat into the Seattle air, through giant cooling towers, at considerable expense.
Waste heat, meet heat consumer.
Amazon and the co-owners of the Westin — Seattle's Clise Properties and San Francisco's Digital Realty Trust — struck a deal:  Amazon would buy some of the Westin's waste heat.
 Tweet: As winter approaches, an innovative heat source will be keeping our Seattle headquarters warm. #greenenergyhttp://amzn.to/2j2t8pI
 The technology is impressive at this scale, but conceptually, it's pretty simple. Water circulates in PVC pipes throughout the Westin, gathering heat. It is then sent beneath the street (city waivers had to be granted to cross public rights of way, a huge problem for waste-heat projects historically) to Doppler tower.
Beneath Doppler, a series of large heat exchangers run the Westin's warm water next to cool water from Amazon, heating it up (exchanging the heat). That warmed water is around 65 degrees, so it is run through a series of five heat-reclaiming chillers to raise the temperature to 130 degrees (also reducing the volume of water).
That hot water is then circulated beneath the floors of the campus buildings via radiant heating systems, providing more than three-quarters of the heating required by the campus, at about four times the energy efficiency of a comparable HVAC system.
The cooled water then returns to the basement to gather more heat, and lo, the cycle continues.
Westin's building manager  told the Seattle Times that the building generates the heat equivalent of about 11 megawatts. During winter, Amazon will siphon off about 5 megawatts of that.
In effect, Westin is replacing Amazon's need for natural gas boilers to heat the water, which would have run close to a million dollars annually in fuel and maintenance costs. Another way of looking at it: the system will allow Amazon to avoid the purchase of some 4 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year.
What's more, the data center is a rock-solid, reliable source of heat; it is guaranteed to always be running (it has backup generators if the grid goes down). Amazon has a couple of efficient natural gas boilers for backup, but at least over the past two winters, it says they have rarely been run.
In exchange, during the winter, Amazon's campus is serving as a giant cooling tower for the Westin, substantially reducing its cooling bill — and paying for the privilege.
It is, to risk cliché, a win-win.
To pull all this off, Amazon and Clise had to create an ""ecodistrict"" (navigating a thicket of city bureaucracy). The coolest part is that there's lots more heat to use, so there's no reason the district couldn't be extended to more Amazon buildings, or to surrounding buildings.
There's nothing new about ""district heating"" — i.e., heating multiple buildings using a single source and a network of pipes. The concept dates all the way back to the Roman Empire. In the Industrial Era, such systems were frequently used to exploit the heat from small in-city power plants. A number of modern cities, from Paris to Tokyo to Vancouver, BC, have district heating systems in use today, fueled by everything from biomass to sewer water to solid waste incineration.
What is somewhat novel about Amazon's arrangement is the use of an electricity consumer — a data center — as the heat source. (Waste heat from data centers is used in other places, though Amazon says this is the first contract between a data center and a heat consumer with different owners.)
As I mentioned, this sits right at the intersection of three of my enduring obsessions.
First, it represents enormous energy savings with relatively old and reliable technology — it's just water run through pipes. What produced the savings was not some whiz-bang tech innovation, but simple design. Cities produce enormous amounts of waste heat and then import enormous amounts of energy to warm themselves. It's kinda crazy. Smarter design could help close that loop, reducing the need for imports, reducing emissions, and bringing more of a city's energy management under its own control.
Second, along the same lines: cities! Cities are everything this century. State, provincial, and national governments are often captured by rural or corporate interests, creating substantial status quo bias. In cities, however, constant change is a fact of life and governments are at least somewhat more nimble — and that's especially true when it comes to experimentation and innovation around the clean-energy transition. The more cities can generate and manage their own energy, the less hostage they are to state and national policy shifts.
With that in mind, why not bring more highly energy-intensive operations — not just data centers, but, oh,  indoor farms, or marijuana grow operations — into dense urban areas? They have traditionally been built in the hinterlands, where land and power are cheap, but if they could make a substantial second income selling their waste heat, they might be able to justify urban locations.
That would reduce shipping supply lines. It would bring tax-paying, profit-making industrial facilities that don't pollute into urban boundaries and budgets. It could potentially reduce urban HVAC bills, if the facilities are hooked up to district heating systems. And it would give cities more direct control over their energy fate.
Third: Amazon opted for a hydronic (fluid-circulating) system, drawing on local sources of heat — not direct electrical heating. Is this an exception to my ""electrify everything"" mantra?
Yes and no. Mostly no. The key difference here is that the local source of heat is itself electrical — a data center. So in that sense, Amazon is using electricity for heat. In fact, it is helping Seattle use its electricity more efficiently, getting more work out of the same kWh.
The expert community is divided on the possibility, or advisability, of moving all HVAC to electricity (like  heat pumps). It would require an enormous amount of capital and produce an enormous new electricity load. Limitations on both probably mean that we'll need zero-carbon HVAC alternatives that still draw on heated water or combusted fuel, which can substitute more easily in retrofits of today's buildings.
Perhaps some of that fuel can itself come from electricity — it is increasingly possible to synthesize liquid fuels that way. But a great deal of the heated water can come from existing and planned sources of waste heat, preferably drawing on electrical sources.
If electricity is zero carbon, then all subsequent derivatives, from waste heat to synthetic liquid fuels, will be zero carbon as well. That is the magic of clean electricity.
 Better design, urban density, and electrification all require far-seeing investment
 There's a telling line in  Amazon's blog post on this project:
 Because of the up-front investment to build it, the ecodistrict isn't currently delivering heat that's any cheaper compared to a typical system, according to [Mike Moriarty, the Senior Engineering Manager who leads operations and maintenance for campus], but ""the price of electricity is only going to go up."" 
This is like so many clean-energy technologies: The upfront investment is high relative to the alternatives, but it pays back many times over throughout its life.
As Amazon adds buildings to the system — and maybe someday, as Seattle expands the system beyond Amazon's campus — the savings will pile up ever higher, eventually dwarfing the upfront investment.
A robust district energy system could save Seattle money for a hundred years. Again, it's just pipes with water, a technology that has stood the test of time. All that's needed is policy coordination and good design.
Whatever its other sins, Amazon has shown itself willing to make patient investments; that's why it keeps growing but never  makes much profit. It invests for the long term.
Almost more than anything, it is that mentality — the willingness to sink upfront investment into long-term savings — that can move corporations (and society) toward sustainability. For that reason alone, I hope this project pays off for Amazon.
And I hope Amazon carries the lesson over to its  next headquarters.

 ""Alexa, sell yourself.""
Amazon's goal this shopping season appears to be clear from its promotions and its placement: pump its voice shopping assistants, Echo and Echo Dot. 
 The top advertisement on its page on Black Friday featured four Amazon products, two of which were voice: Echo Dot for $29.99 (down from $49.99) and Echo for $79.99 (down from $99.99). It listed Echo Dot first in its ""Hottest Deals"" category and Amazon device deals. The promotions continued through the weekend in advance of Cyber Monday.
It was also promoting the product in Bloomingdale's and through its partnership with Kohl's.

 Google, meanwhile, was selling its $49 Google Home Mini for $29 along with a $10 coupon on its own website. Similar Google Home Mini deals could be found at Best Buy, Williams-Sonoma and Office Depot. 
Echo was one of the top sellers on Thanksgiving and through Black Friday morning, according to Adobe Analytics.
The battle between Google and Amazon in promoting their voice products goes beyond winning the $4 billion U.S. smart-speaker market. Amazon already controls 70 percent of the category. They continue to eye the leverage that voice gives in search and control over the shopping process. 
Voice results are more persuasive than web results. It is easier to scroll down a web page than it is to listen through each item listing. This capacity has already become evident in Amazon's usage of Alexa to push its private label and reinvigorate the importance of sponsored products.
""With voice, they can more effectively push than ever before,"" said Aaron Cheris, head of Bain's Americas retail practice.
If a shopper searches for an item on Alexa that is offered by Amazon private label, it first recommends its own private-label products 17 percent of the time, despite the fact these products make up 2 percent of products sold, according to an analysis done by Bain.
Meanwhile, roughly 5 percent of Alexa's first recommendations are sponsored products, not ""Amazon's Choice"" or a top search result. Unlike on its web pages, Amazon does not label these results as sponsored.

Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.
 Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos now has a 12-digit fortune, according to an estimate by Bloomberg.
 Bezos's net worth surpassed $100 billion on Friday, Bloomberg reported. Amazon shares hit a record on Black Friday — one of the year's busiest shopping days— joining a broader stock market rally.
Bezos, the world's richest man, owns about 78.9 million shares of Amazon, according to a Nov. 14 filing. That stake alone is worth more than $93.5 billion as of Friday's closing price of $1,186 a share.
 Amazon is not his only business venture. Bezos also invests in start-ups, and owns The Washington Post and space company Blue Origin. These companies can be difficult to value, but Forbes still puts Bezos's fortune at $99.6 billion.
Bezos is followed on the list of wealthiest people by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. They've both already allocated significant chunks of their fortunes to philanthropy, a goal that Bezos is also exploring.

Groceries are prepared for distribution at Tesco's distribution plant in Reading, England.
 Money managers are flocking to a new spot in the U.K. real estate market.
 Traditional office spaces are losing their attractiveness to investors, but the appetite for industrials and logistics spaces is on the rise.
Industrials and logistics are offering the highest returns ""due to the shift from physical stores to online shopping, as retailers are looking for more space,"" James Carswell, analyst at the stock broker Peel Hunt, told CNBC on the phone Monday. ""There are more people buying online and there's a growing need for quicker delivery times.""
 The rise of Amazon, eBay and other online shopping services like Ocado is creating the need for large warehouses and storage units. Alongside growing customer demand to receive purchased items as quickly as possible, this is requiring an increasing number of storage spaces – both big boxes in the countryside and smaller units closer to biggest cities, mainly London.

Parcels are prepared for dispatch at Amazon's warehouse in Hemel Hempstead, England.
 Miles Gibson, head of U.K. research at commercial real estate services and investment firm CBRE, told CNBC last week that industrials and logistics are performing ""very strongly… and investors are seeing double-digit returns.""
The other side of commercial property, offices, aren't proving as interesting for investors.
""Offices, for example, are affected by the fact the we have full employment, nearly full employment, in the U.K. so employment growth is slowing, which means demand for offices is slowing, so we are expecting rent growth in office sector for example to slow as well,"" Gibson told CNBC.
Another issue for office spaces is Brexit and the uncertainty as to how trade between the U.K. and European companies will work after 2019.
""Most of the office space is concentrated in London. Because of Brexit and the uncertainty surrounding it, we expect companies to delay big decisions and thus are generally less likely to sign a new 20-year lease,"" Carswell said.
He added that relatively high rents and low yields in the office space mean that there is not much room to make returns in investments in this part of the sector. However, he noted that there are a few exceptions, including regional offices, which ""offer more upside with higher yields and rents which still look affordable.""

 The Essential phone is just $399 from Amazon on Monday and includes a 4K 360-degree camera attachment that normally costs $199.
 If you're unfamiliar, the Essential phone was launched by the founder of Android, Andy Rubin, earlier this year. The phone was initially priced at $699 but was quickly discounted. Reports have suggested the phone hasn't been selling well, so these new price points might help Essential increase its consumer base.
 The Essential phone offers a unique design with a screen that takes up almost the entire front face. It's made of high-quality parts, though doesn't offer some of the more compelling high-end features of other smartphones — such as support for virtual reality, expandable storage, water-resistance or great cameras — which may have contributed to its lack of initial success.
 At $399, however, the Essential phone is a great buy, especially for folks on a budget but who still desire a device with a certain wow effect.

 });Jeff Bezos has cities across the United States all but pleading to be the location of Amazon's second headquarters. But a few decades back, Amazon's offices in Seattle were less than desirable, to say the least.
 In 1999, five years after Amazon was founded, the company's headquarters was on the same street as a pawn shop, a heroin-needle exchange and a ""porno parlor.""
That's according to the profile CBS' Bob Simon did of Bezos in 1999 for ""60 Minutes."" Tech blog GeekWire recently resurfaced the 13-minute profile as Bezos' net worth shot past $100 billion in the wake of a pop in the Amazon stock price on Black Friday.
 On the show, Simon navigates to Amazon headquarters, where he meets Bezos for the interview.
""And where are Amazon's headquarters? The public relations people told us to come to 1516 Second Avenue between Pike and Pine in Seattle,"" says Simon, as he walks down the block.
 var mps=mps||{}; mps._queue=mps._queue||{}; mps._queue.gptloaded=mps._queue.gptloaded||[];

 ""But when we passed the pawn shop and the porno parlor, the wig store and the downmarket teriyaki joint, we didn't see anything vaguely cutting-edge. No corporate drives or office towers. Just a heroin-needle exchange and an old building called Columbia, but it had the number 1516 so we walked inside — and there it was.""
When Simon got upstairs, he was surprised — yet again — by the banality of the office, including the badly stained carpet and Bezos' desk, made out of a door propped up on two-by-fours.
Even in 1999, Bezos was likely a billionaire several times over. (Simon asked Bezos later in the segment about being worth $9 billion to $10 billion dollars — a figure which Bezos neither confirmed nor denied.) So why the makeshift workspace?

 ""It's a symbol of spending money on things that matter to customers and not spending money on things that don't,"" says Bezos, who at the time was wearing a blue dress shirt and khakis and drove a Honda. 
When Simon zinged the billionaire for driving a Honda, Bezos' response: ""This is a perfectly good car.""
Bezos, who initially went to work on Wall Street after graduating as valedictorian of his high school class and attending Princeton University, goes on to tell Simon he had a very logical philosophy for leaving his Wall Street gig to start Amazon — what he calls his ""regret minimization framework.""
""I want to have lived my life in such a way that when I'm 80 years old, I've minimized the number of regrets that I have,"" Bezos says. ""I think actually a lot of people do that — even if they don't call it something as dorky as regret minimization framework, they behave that way.""
That doesn't mean he didn't know there's real risk in his decision-making. ""I tell people around here to wake up petrified and afraid every morning,"" says Bezos to Simon. ""I know we can lose it all — it's not fear, it's a fact.""
Tens of billions of dollars later, Bezos has a better fashion sense, but perhaps his attitude hasn't changed all that much.

UnitedHealth office
 For UnitedHealth Group the focus next year is more about getting ahead of potential competition from tech heavyweights such as Amazon and Apple than getting bogged down in the twists and turns of health reform in Washington. That was the underlying message from new CEO David Wichmann at the health-care company's analyst day in New York. ""People have asked me, 'What's going to be different now that you're CEO?' My short response is that very little will change and everything will change,"" said Wichmann, who succeeded Stephen Hemsley as chief executive in September, after serving as UnitedHealth's chief financial officer for five years. ""This is a restless company, dissatisfied with the status quo in health care,"" he said. UnitedHealth is forecasting 2018 revenue growth of roughly 12 percent, to $223 billion to $225 billion, which is above the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. The main growth drivers are expected to be the company's Optum data analytics and health-care services business, and growth in the Medicare Advantage membership on the health insurance side. Executives said the return of the Obamacare health insurance tax next year will pose a 75-cent-per-share headwind to profits. They are projecting full-year earnings of $10.55 to $10.85 per share, excluding items. Beyond its financial goals, UnitedHealth executives outlined a number of programs that tap Optum's data and apply machine learning to improve patient engagement and outcomes with both commercial employer members and Medicare enrollees. Asked about the potential threat of Amazon and other tech giants entering the health-care market, Larry Renfro, the chief executive of the insurer's Optum unit, said the company is trying to catch up when it comes to early-stage companies. Renfro announced the launch of Optum Ventures during the meeting, which is committing $250 million to fund digital health-care firms. Among the fund's first investments are Apervita, a cloud-based analytics platform; SHYFT Analytics, a cloud-based pharmaceutical research platform, and Mindstrong Health, which uses machine learning to help patients assess their mental health disorders through their smartphones. ""Optum Ventures is uniquely positioned to help develop and grow start-ups and early-stage companies through capital investment, Optum's decades of experience in health care, and our access to the health-care marketplace,"" said Renfro. In addition, the firm recently completed its $1.3 billion acquisition of the Advisory Board's consulting unit. As a result of that deal, UnitedHealth has a 5.5 percent stake in hospital IT firm Evolent Health, making it the firm's largest stakeholder. The Advisory Board acquisition was one of three transactions the health insurer made this year, including a $2.3 billion deal for Surgical Care Affiliates, and a $2.8 billion deal for Chilean insurer Banmedica. UnitedHealth's acquisitions have helped drive double-digit revenue growth in the current decade. In the wake of failed health insurance mergers earlier this year, some of its competitors are now eyeing the UnitedHealth model of vertical integration. Sources tell CNBC that CVS Health has explored a merger with Aetna, valued at upwards of $66 billion. Both companies will hold their investor updates next month. UnitedHealth's new CEO may not be looking over his shoulder with worry, but he told investors he's not going to rest on the company's laurels. ""We know we can perform better,"" Wichmann said. ""We are more than willing and capable of stepping up our game."" UnitedHealth's shares were down more than 1 percent in the premarket, following the company's initial guidance for 2018, but shares turned positive as the company's presentation concluded late morning, and closed Tuesday up 1.7 percent.

 Amazon shares may pop another 20%   
 1:15  PM ET Tue, 28 Nov 2017 |  00:44 
 Amazon shares will soar in the next year thanks to its rapid pace of innovation and increased price flexibility, according to Goldman Sachs.
 Goldman expects big things from the e-commerce giant at its annual re:Invent conference this week, where analyst Heath Terry sees a number of product announcements. Terry reiterated his buy rating and increased his price target on Amazon to $1,450 from $1,300, implying 21 percent upside from Monday's close.
""The number of product announcements made during re:Invent has significantly increased in recent years, with more than 15 announced in 2016 versus less than 10 in each of its first 3 years,"" Terry wrote on Tuesday. We ""see the potential for further partnerships like the VMware collaboration (Oct-2016) and the more recent hybrid partnership with QTS.""
 Amazon is hosting its annual re:Invent conference this week in Las Vegas, where it has traditionally announced new products, partnerships and updates to Web Services. Thousands are expected to attend, eager for an update on the company's abilities in cloud technology.
""We continue to believe Amazon's pace of innovation, increasing pricing flexibility, and an aging corporate technology base, will drive the ongoing shift of workloads into the cloud,"" explained Terry. ""On top of its rapid pace of innovation and its penetration into developers, Amazon Web Services' product breadth also represents a competitive moat, in our view. With nearly 100 products available across regions, companies would need to combine multiple vendors to compile the list of services offered collectively by Amazon Web Services.""
The retail behemoth has continued to impress Wall Street with its climb to the top of retail and online shopping. Led by billionaire Jeff Bezos, the company has seen its shares appreciate roughly 60 percent since the start of January, preceding what is expected to be a strong holiday season.
Data from Adobe Analytics showed online Black Friday sales rose nearly 17 percent from last year. Shares closed down 0.2 percent Tuesday.
Terry also noted that Amazon's ""retail reach"" now expands far beyond traditional categories and is disrupting areas like health care, advertising, and logistics. Within the past year, Amazon has acquired Whole Foods Market, made some curious movements in the pharmaceutical and health care space, and announced that it was looking to establish a second headquarters, known as HQ2.
""Amazon's announcement of HQ2 created significant media attention and local/state government interest around its stated 50,000 jobs and $5 billion of investment,"" concluded Terry. ""It is possible that the location of the new headquarters could provide some insight into the way management is thinking about the positioning of Amazon Web Services.""

 Darroch said that while the two U.S. content platforms produce ""fantastically high-quality programs,"" they are aimed at global audiences, which could be a disadvantage.
""Even when produced outside the U.S., there is a necessary uniformity to the creativity,"" he said Monday at a conference in Tallinn, Estonia.
 Darroch added that Sky, which broadcasts in the U.K., Ireland, Italy, Germany and Austria, could create shows that represent European storytelling but with international appeal.

 ""America simply does not have our rich historic tapestry to tap into and, while U.S. drama formats set the benchmark for quality, they cannot compete for diversity and cultural resonance,"" he said, according to an online transcript of his speech.
The rush for eyeballs between online movie and TV streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon and traditional content-makers continues apace, with Disney set to remove its movies from Netflix and launch its own streaming service in 2019 and Amazon Prime on track to be in half of U.S. households by the end of 2017.
Darroch added that the mixture of public and commercial broadcasters in Europe meant the region is able to compete with U.S. shows.
""Much of the debate about the future of Europe's audio-visual industry has been colored by a fear that the internet will destroy our business models. I hope I have convinced you that is not happening,"" he said.

YouTube has hit the headlines recently after advertisers withdrew campaigns in the face of inappropriate content, while Facebook said in October that about 126 million Americans may have seen posts by Russian operatives in an effort to influence U.S. politics.
""Not so many years ago, internet companies were small and pretty un-influential,"" he said. ""Today they are some of the largest companies on the planet with a reach and scale of financial resources far exceeding that of previous media and communications companies.
""We are regulated because of our impact on society, yet their impact on society today is arguably much greater. Yet they face none of the scrutiny or regulation that broadcasters meet … At best, our valued standards of content are being eroded; at worst, fundamentally undermined.""

 Instacart CEO: Amazon-Whole Foods deal was a turning point in the industry   
 3:09  PM ET Tue, 28 Nov 2017 |  02:07 
 Albertsons, the nation's second-largest grocer, announced a deal on Tuesday with Instacart, expanding the grocery delivery start-up's service to more than 1,800 U.S. stores by mid-2018.
 As Amazon's surprising acquisition of Whole Foods threatens to disrupt an entire industry, American grocers are increasingly looking for ways to boost their e-commerce offerings — and are increasingly finding a partner in Instacart.
Just three months after the Amazon-Whole Foods deal, Instacart has now signed up the top five U.S. grocers: Kroger, Albertsons, Ahold, Publix, and H-E-B. Instacart also expanded its partnership with Costco, and earlier this month announced a deal with Canada's largest grocer, Loblaw, its first international foray.
 ""Ever since the Amazon-Whole Foods deal happened, things are very different,"" Instacart CEO Apoorva Mehta told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa. ""After that deal happened, we were every major retailer's first call."" 
For traditional grocers, partnering with Instacart is a way to boost their e-commerce platforms and push deeper into the grocery delivery business as Amazon applies its technology and logistics network to Whole Foods.
With Instacart, Albertsons is doubling down on grocery delivery. Earlier this year, it began rolling out same-day delivery for its Safeway and Albertsons brands. In September, it acquired the meal-kit company Plated.
The growing number of partnerships Instacart signed in recent months is a way for the five-year-old start-up to look beyond 2021, when its exclusive deal with Whole Foods expires and, presumably, Amazon takes over.
Mehta said he didn't know whether Instacart would continue its partnership with Whole Foods after the contract's official end. 
Also as part of that deal, Whole Foods invested an undisclosed amount in Instacart. It's a twist that becomes more complex as Instacart signs up more Whole Foods competitors.
In the new grocery landscape, a shakeup is brewing and Instacart is increasingly putting itself in the middle.
Instacart was last valued at $3.4 billion and is backed by some of the biggest names in venture capital, including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins.

 });Following a projected $6.59 billion in Cyber Monday sales, Amazon's stock has risen nearly 5 percent over the past week heading into the holiday season.
 That sharp increase in value could explain why its founder and chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, is now estimated to be the richest man in the world with a net worth of over $90 billion, according to industry estimates.
If you had invested in Amazon early on, when it first debuted on the Nasdaq in 1997, you could be worth a lot of money today, too. In fact, if you bought $1,000 in stock even 10 years later, in 2007, your investment would be worth $12,398 as of October 31 of this year. 
 That's according to financial website How Much, which took a look at some popular stocks in 2007 to find out how much a $1,000 investment in each would be worth now. Of the companies it examined, Amazon's performance was second only to the success of Netflix.
In the graphic below, the blue dots are equivalent to a $1,000 initial investment, and the pink dots equal the investment's current total value.

 ""The larger the pink circle, the more your investment is worth,"" according to How Much. ""If the pink fits inside the blue, then you lost money. The [graphic] assumes that you took any dividend paid out in cash and did not reinvest into the company by buying more stock.""
While stocks like Netflix, Amazon and Apple have performed well, any individual stock can over- or under-perform. 
That's perhaps why Warren Buffett, the chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway, chose not to invest in Amazon when he had the chance. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in May, the self-made billionaire said he didn't appreciate the value of tech stocks at first.
""I was too dumb to realize. I did not think [Bezos] could succeed on the scale he has,"" Buffett said, adding that he ""really underestimated the brilliance of the execution.""
 Citing Amazon's massive success, Buffett went on to call Bezos ""the most remarkable business person of our age.""
If you're looking to invest in the next Amazon, or if you're just starting to consider putting some money in the stock market, experienced investors like Buffett, Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins suggest you start carefully.
Begin with index funds, they say, which hold every stock in an index such as the S&P 500, including big-name brands such as Apple, Microsoft and Google, and offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills. Index funds also fluctuate with the market, stay pretty constant and eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.
Investing for the first time can be a big step, and it can be risky. Past returns do not predict future results. But if you find the right stocks, it can lead to real rewards.

 How Fanatics stays one step ahead of Amazon and Alibaba   
 1:45  PM ET Tue, 28 Nov 2017 |  01:30 
 Sportswear company Fanatics has carved out a lucrative slice of the $25 billion global sports licensing market. It has licensing rights with North America's four major sports leagues (NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB), plus the PGA, Nascar and Major League Soccer.
 Their deals with the major leagues average around 15 years and they've take a fast retailing approach -- like H&M and Zara -- which means they can capitalize on what it's chairman Michael Rubin calls ""micro-moments.""
Examples include Odell Beckham's one handed catch earlier this year, or when Jeremy Lin seemed to come out of nowhere in 2012 and Linsanity fever took hold. Another one of those unpredictable moments came a few months ago when Pittsburgh Steelers offensive tackle Alejandro Villaneuva stood for the anthem while his teammates stayed in the locker room and demand for his jersey suddenly surged.
 Fanatics capitalizes on the big moments too.
Like when the Chicago Cubs won the World Series last year and Fanatics used Ubers to get championship gear in fans hands within minutes.
Fanatics designs, develops, and manufactures the majority of what it sells.
The company's chairman Michael Rubin says Fanatics is the largest verticalized company in the world -- and that's their competitive advantage against online retail behemoths like Amazon and Alibaba, which also sell fan gear but on a smaller scale.
But that doesn't mean Amazon, which is pushing deeper into the clothing business, couldn't become a bigger threat. To stay ahead, Fanatics is accumulating licensing rights across all sports and going global to capture emerging markets.
It's also attracting investment from Japanese conglomerate Softbank, which invested $1 billion in the company earlier this year.

 It's a big week for Amazon. 
 Cyber Monday and the mass of online shoppers brought another record high in Amazon's stock price, while in Las Vegas, the company's cloud computing business kicked off its annual re:Invent conference. 
Amazon's 2017 rally lifted Jeff Bezos' net worth past $100 billion on Friday, and he now towers over Bill Gates and Warren Buffett on the list of the world's richest people. 
 With so much going on inside Amazon, including the hunt for a second headquarters location, CNBC decided it was a good time to find out who are the power players at this sprawling company.
We tracked down an organization chart, which is available internally but not to the public. 
One immediately noticeable fact is that Amazon, like so much of the tech universe, is a company run by men. Specifically white men.
In marketplace, Prime and AWS, or what Bezos likes to call the three pillars of the business, there are 37 people under the CEO who report directly to him — or are one layer removed — with at least the title of vice president. Only two of them are women. 
 'Simply right'
 That theme will be clearly on display at re:Invent. Andy Jassy is CEO of the cloud unit and only one of the 15 most senior people below him is a woman. 
Amazon appears to be making an effort to fix this problem. As Recode reported last month, a growing number of women are leading important parts of the company. They include Toni Reid with Alexa, Stephenie Landry in Prime Now and Jennifer Cast at Amazon Books. The company also has technical advisors, who shadow the unit CEOs and attend all of their meetings for training purposes. Currently, two of the three are women.
Still, the numbers are vastly underwhelming for a company that makes diversity part of its leadership principles. In fact, Bezos wrote in a letter last year that diversity and inclusion are not just good for business, but ""simply right."" In the list below, there are no African-Americans and three people of Asian descent. 
Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment.
Most people on the list have spent years, if not decades, at the company. Jassy along with Jeff Wilke, CEO of the consumer group, and Jeff Blackburn, who runs the video and ads businesses, have been at Amazon since its early days. Dave Clark, who runs retail operations, and Greg Greeley, who leads Prime, both joined the company in 1999.
There have also been more recent high-profile hires. Babak Parviz, who created Google Glass, joined Amazon in 2014 and now runs a special team called ""Grand Challenge."" Adam Bosworth, who left Salesforce last year, is in charge of the AWS software team. Dave Treadwell, a 27-year Microsoft veteran,  joined Amazon last year as vice president of e-commerce services.

Jeff Bezos
 Amazon's Echo Dot was the top-selling product on Amazon.com over the holiday weekend, the company revealed Tuesday morning.
 Earlier this year, the mini Alexa-enabled device also outsold all other products on Amazon's Prime Day, which was the internet giant's most successful Prime Day to date.
""Customers purchased millions of Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices this weekend, and Alexa devices were the top sellers across all of Amazon,"" Dave Limp, senior vice president of Amazon's devices and services division, said Tuesday.
 Amazon said ""millions"" of Alexa-enabled devices were sold from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, including the Fire TV Stick, the new Echo, and Amazon's Fire 7 tablet.
The Echo Dot was also a best seller at Whole Foods' grocery locations across the country over the weekend, Amazon said.
Earlier this month, Amazon announced it would be opening holiday pop-up shops at Whole Foods' stores, bringing in more tech gadgets, and also slashing prices further on various holiday-related foods, such as turkey and sweet potatoes.
On Black Friday, the top advertisement placement on Amazon.com featured four Amazon products, two of which were voice-enabled. The Echo Dot was selling for $29.99 (down from $49.99), and the original Echo retailed for $79.99 (down from $99.99). The promotions continued through the weekend in advance of Cyber Monday.
Meantime, many other retailers, including Target and Wal-Mart, were promoting discounts on Google's Home and Home Mini.
Amazon's stock was nearing $1,200 a share Tuesday morning, after CEO Jeff Bezos amassed a net worth of more than $100 billion Friday evening, on the heels of a successful Black Friday.
GBH Insights has predicted the e-commerce giant rung up as much as 50 percent of all online purchases on Black Friday. Analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to clients that Amazon had an ""eye-popping"" performance, even prior to Cyber Monday.

 174 million people shopped Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday   
 10:26  AM ET Wed, 29 Nov 2017 |  01:12 
 Amazon just had its biggest shopping day ever.
 The most products ever ordered in one day on Amazon.com occurred on Cyber Monday, the company revealed Wednesday. The day's transactions surpassed those made on Amazon's recent record-breaking Prime Day, and the top-selling item was the Echo Dot.
Amazon said orders made via its app increased more than 50 percent on Cyber Monday, when compared with a year ago.
 From Thanksgiving Day through Monday, Amazon said customers shopped at ""record levels,"" ordering ""hundreds of millions"" of products ranging from apparel to toys to electronics. From small businesses alone, nearly 140 million items were purchased on Amazon.com.
On the heels of a successful Black Friday, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos watched his net worth surpass $100 billion Friday evening.
Amazon shares were nearing $1,200 Wednesday morning, and are up more than 50 percent in 2017.
Amazon isn't the only retailer benefiting from strong holiday sales. On Tuesday, Adobe revealed online sales on Cyber Monday topped $6.5 billion, making it the largest digital shopping day in U.S. history. Sales from mobile devices reached $2 billion for the first time in a 24-hour window.

Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services and Infrastructure.
 Amazon has a track record of coming out with hardware like tablets and smart speakers. And a couple of years ago Amazon's cloud division joined in the fun with a box full of hard drives for moving data to the cloud.
 Now Amazon Web Services is going further with a special camera that can run artificial intelligence software out of the box.
The high-definition DeepLens camera, which AWS is revealing Wednesday at its annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, ships with pretrained models that will make it easier for developers to start doing things like recognizing text characters that appear in a video stream. Alternatively, developers will be able to train their own image recognition models with the help of AWS' new SageMaker AI service and then run those models on the camera.
 DeepLens is coming out two months after Google — one of Amazon's top cloud competitors — unveiled the Clips AI-powered camera, which captures photos and videos when interesting things happen in front of it.
But while Clips is intended for consumers and therefore could one day contribute meaningful revenue to Google parent company Alphabet, DeepLens is aimed at a more technical audience.
""It's really designed to allow everyday developers to get experience doing machine learning and deep learning,"" Andy Jassy, CEO of AWS, told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview this week.
In that sense, DeepLens bears a resemblance to Dash Buttons that AWS has previously sold to developers. A Dash Button is a dead-simple gadget with a single large button. Using AWS services, developers could control what happened when people pushed the button.
DeepLens, for its part, could ultimately help accelerate adoption of AWS' AI services, which is important because Google and Microsoft offer cloud services for training and deploying AI models alongside AWS. AWS released a managed service for running machine learning tasks in 2015 and introduced tools for image recognition and speech recognition last year.
AWS leads the cloud infrastructure services market with 31.8 percent share in the third quarter, according to Canalys. In that quarter, AWS brought Amazon $4.58 billion in revenue and more than $1 billion in operating income.

 Cloud services a 3-horse race between Amazon, Google and Microsoft: Analyst   
 7:41  PM ET Wed, 29 Nov 2017 |  02:38 
 Amazon's market-leading cloud business is launching a bunch of artificial intelligence tools.
 On Wednesday at the Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, AWS CEO Andy Jassy announced one new AI service after another. The new tools do things like measure sentiment, track people in video feeds, and translate languages, among other things.
Here are some of them:
 The new Amazon Rekognition Video tool is able to recognize and track people in real-time video feeds, giving it certain advantages over video recognition tools from cloud rivals Google and Microsoft. The Amazon Transcribe system can transcribe audio recordings of people speaking into clean text files. The Amazon Comprehend service can pick up on positive or negative sentiment and certain people, places and phrases in text.  AWS also unveiled Amazon Translate, a service for translating text from one language into another, which Google has provided to developers for years. CNBC first reported that AWS was working on a translation tool in June. 
""We have to solve the problem of making [AI] accessible for everyday developers and scientists, Jassy told an audience that exceeded 40,000.
These announcements come alongside the new SageMaker service for more easily deploying AI models and a $250 high-definition AI-powered camera.
To be sure, cloud-managed services for AI probably won't bring in the majority of AWS' revenue for Amazon in the near future, but their availability could help inspire some companies to use AWS either instead of or in addition to another cloud provider. AWS now has more than 100 services on offer , Jassy told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.

 With companies like Microsoft, Facebook, IBM and Amazon receiving thousands of applications a year, your hiring chances may appear slim. That's why high level recruiters and HR execs at these four tech giants have openly discussed what it takes to snag a job at their respective companies.
 Microsoft
 The tech company employs approximately 73,000 people in the U.S. and over 125,000 people worldwide, so it's safe to say Microsoft receives a ton of applications.
 The company's head of global talent acquisition Chuck Edward tells CNBC Make It that candidates should do three things to stand out from the competition: Show that you have a career mindset, demonstrate a customer obsession and prove that you're a learner.
Edward adds that your resume should also describe your past leadership experience and how you have ""achieved results, progressed and learned."" Why? Because Microsoft favors applicants who ""embrace the future,"" says the HR exec.

""We're always looking at something and thinking, 'That works pretty well, but it can be even better,"" she tells Glassdoor. ""What that means is that we are never done,""

 IBM takes a unique approach to hiring, vice president of talent Joanna Daly tells CNBC Make It. As the tech industry deals with the ongoing shortage of workers, IBM is now focusing on skill-based hiring rather than education level and four-year degrees.
IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty refers to these types of employees as ""new collar"" hires. One of those new collar hires is Sean Davis, a security engineer for IBM's cybersecurity business.
He tells CNBC Make It that his number one advice for other non-traditional candidates looking to edge their way into the company is to obtain ample hands-on experience.
""Always stay current on the industry and on new technology,"" says Davis. ""Always hone your craft.""

 The retail giant has held massive career fairs to fill open roles across its facilities. But even with this hiring frenzy, scoring a position at the company is no easy feat. In fact, the company continously ranks as one of the most sought-after employers.
If you want to score a position at the retailer, says Amazon's director of university recruiting Miriam Park, you should be focused on the customer and ""relentlessly curious.""
""We start working backwards from the customer,"" Park tells CNBC Make It, noting that this is a central theme throughout the company and is upheld by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
Curiosity is also important, says the HR recruiter, because Amazon continually explores new ideas and welcomes innovation from its employees.
Her No. 1 piece of advice to applicants is this: Focus on ""how you have owned a role and moved the needle forward, demonstrated curiosity and where you have solved a problem.""

Andy Jassy, chief executive officer of web services at Amazon.com Inc.
 Amazon's behemoth cloud division has swallowed eight or nine companies in the past few years — and it would buy up even more if not for Silicon Valley's sky-high valuations, the top executive said. 
Andy Jassy, Amazon's highest-paid executive and head of Amazon Web Services, told CNBC that Amazon is more rigorous than rivals when it comes to M&A. 
 ""You know, most of them have been relatively small acquisitions. They've been great teams and great technology,"" Jassy said. ""We'd like to do more. I think there's two things that sometimes give us pause. One is, we tend to be a little bit more rigorous maybe than others choose to be in our analysis and valuations. And sometimes the valuations that are out there just haven't matched what we can kind of get our heads around."" 
Amazon's cloud business leads the rest of the market considerably — it had about 44 percent market share in 2016, according to Gartner's ""infrastructure as a service"" estimates. And when AWS goes down, much of the internet crashes with it.
But Jassy's remarks reflect a growing trend of caution in Silicon Valley, even for companies as rich as Amazon, as more and more start-ups reach ""unicorn"" valuations of $1 billion or more.
""I'm not passing judgment,"" Jassy said in an interview that aired on Tuesday. ""We have a history, and confidence, in being able to build ourselves. And so at a certain point, if we know customers really want something, and we're looking at something that we believe can accelerate our efforts in that area — but we just can't get our heads around the valuation or it's not the right fit — then we're also not afraid to go hire people and build it.""

 Amazon is getting ready to bring Alexa to work   
 11:39  AM ET Thu, 30 Nov 2017 |  01:00 
 (Amazon officially announced it on Thursday morning.)
 Alexa will soon be going to work.
While Amazon has been busy announcing new cloud services for developers this week at its annual re:Invent conference, the company is preparing to talk about new tools that will make it easier for people to use Amazon's Alexa voice-activated virtual assistant in the workplace, four sources have told CNBC.
 The company intends to announce an Alexa for Business Platform, along with a set of initial partners that have developed specific ""skills,"" or apps, for business customers. 
The new technology could well come in handy for connecting into teleconferences or adding data to enterprise-focused sales programs, sources said. It would also add more personalized features, like an enterprise security layer that identifies and authenticates different people using the app at work, one person said.
Amazon is also likely to announce a new marketplace for the Alexa for Business apps, similar to the Alexa Skills page it already has for consumer apps, according to our source.
The broader goal seems to be aimed at making Alexa a key component to office workers. Alexa is the subject of a number of break-out sessions scheduled for tomorrow. The names of these sessions have not yet been broadly disclosed, but CNBC has obtained a list of them. They give a clue as to what Amazon is thinking: 
 ""Bring your Alexa to work. Voice enable your company"" ""Building smart conference rooms with Alexa"" ""New skills for Alexa for Business"" ""Hack your office: Building the skills that help you at work"" 
 Three years ago, Amazon debuted Alexa as the smart star inside the Echo speaker. Alexa performs the work of understanding what people say and then finding the best possible answer based on what it knows.
Amazon has released tools to accelerate third-party development around Alexa, and today Amazon boasts more than 20,000 third-party skills that people can install and then summon from Alexa. And Amazon has expanded its line of Echo devices and made it possible for other companies to insert Alexa into their devices.
Meanwhile Apple, Google and Microsoft have been busy improving their own virtual assistants, broadening their support for third-party systems and making them more widely available for consumers.
Like Amazon, both Google and Microsoft have been courting enterprises with their cloud infrastructure portfolios. But the assistants have largely targeted consumers outside their work lives. Google and Microsoft have yet to reveal major pushes of the Google Assistant and Cortana, respectively, into the enterprise. But earlier this year Amazon and Microsoft did say they would let Alexa and Cortana start working together.
Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Cramer Remix: Amazon may not be as powerful as it seems   
 7:47  PM ET Thu, 30 Nov 2017 |  01:26 
 As the Dow Jones industrial average soared over 330 points on Thursday, CNBC's Jim Cramer addressed the reasons behind the market's wildly positive action.
 ""Investors decided they were willing to pay more for stocks because good, old-fashioned companies, not just autonomous-driving, bitcoin-operated, artificial-intelligence-led, machine learning [plays], keep delivering upside surprises,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""In short, you have to abandon all cynicism to understand this market.""
So with buyers aplenty and prices on the rise, Cramer gave 10 reasons for why the stock market feels like it may be melting up and ignoring the fundamentals.
 One of the reasons was Kroger and Costco reporting decent results in the face of Amazon's foray into grocery, an effect that Cramer said stemmed from industries' defenses against the e-commerce giant.
""The Rebel Alliance is successfully attacking the Death Star. Or in English, as powerful as Amazon is, it's not big enough to destroy everything, at least not yet,"" Cramer said.
 What to make of the banks

Brian Moynihan, Bank of America Chairman & CEO
 Cramer hates parabolic moves, like the one he noticed in bitcoin's rapid surge on Wednesday.
""I particularly despise parabolic rallies, the kind with a huge upward slope, when you see them in slower growing industries. There's a word for that kind of action, and the word is 'unsustainable,'"" Cramer said. ""Yet that's exactly what's been happening with the bank stocks in the last 72 hours, parabolic moves that seem hard to justify based on the numbers.""
The pattern worried Cramer because he knew the bank stocks — namely Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America — couldn't keep going up at this speed. It dragged everything into question: their valuations, their earnings and whether they were safe investments.
 Hidden electric car plays

 Cramer is always on the lookout for the market's most powerful secular trends, so the rise of electric vehicles wasn't exactly lost on him.
There's just one problem.
""When one of these themes gets big enough, when people realize it truly represents a major secular shift, a tectonic shift, in consumer behavior like we're now seeing with electric cars, the direct beneficiaries of that trend,"" like electric automaker Tesla, ""often see their stocks trade up to nosebleed levels,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
That's why, rather than herding eager investors into the ""cult stock"" that is Tesla, Cramer went hunting for the best ancillary plays, the hidden winners of this rapidly evolving trend.
 Idexx Laboratories CEO on new 'blockbuster' product
 Taking care of your pets has never been more high-tech, at least not according to Idexx Laboratories Chairman and CEO Jonathan Ayers.
Ayers' veterinary biotechnology company has developed a new way to test dogs' intestines that updates the ""old"" microscope method, the CEO said.
""We're going to apply biotechnology to that, improve the sensitivity to whether the dog has worms, and make it much easier and faster to provide those results,"" Ayers told Cramer on Thursday. ""This is going to be a blockbuster point of care launch for us, and we expect to bring it to the market mid-2018.""
And in an age where people, especially young people, care about their pets more than ever, an instant solution for treating their pets is in high demand, Ayers acknowledged.
""Millennials are the pet generation. I don't know what we taught them, but 57 percent of millennials say that pets make them happier than almost anything else, and that's a high among the generations,"" the CEO told Cramer.
 Lightning Round: Don't be diplomatic
 In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
Diplomat Pharmacy Inc.: ""We don't like specialty pharma. It hurt us so much during the downturn. I'm going to have to say stay away from that, honestly.""
Cleveland-Cliffs: ""You're break-even on Cliffs? That is the greatest news in the world. You know why? Because you can sell, sell, sell. We do not like that commodity one bit.""

 Amazon in talks with generic drug makers   
 5:49  PM ET Thu, 30 Nov 2017 |  02:46 
 Amazon has held preliminary talks with makers of generic drugs about its potential entry into the pharmacy space, according to people familiar with the discussions.
 The conversations, including with generics giants Mylan and Sandoz, a unit of Novartis, have been high-level, and the nature of Amazon's plans isn't yet clear, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions aren't public.
Shares of Mylan were up nearly 2.5 percent in after-hours trading.
 Health care investment bank Leerink confirmed in a note to investors on Thursday that Sandoz' Peter Goldschmidt at a recent biopharma event ""met and discussed with Amazon its plans for getting into the U.S. healthcare market."" But it was not made clear whether Amazon will enter as a drug wholesaler, meaning business-to-business, or sell generic medications as a retailer. 
Sandoz also said it does not expect Amazon to have a ""major impact"" on its business.

 Analyst: Amazon's pharmacy opportunity not as big as expected   
 11:14  AM ET Tue, 21 Nov 2017 |  03:48 
 One of the people said the conversations are about Amazon taking a role in drug purchasing, potentially disrupting a space now dominated by distributors McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health. Generics manufacturers are eager to establish a relationship with Amazon as part of 2018 business plans, the person said. 
Stocks of drug distributors and others in the pharmaceutical supply chain, such as pharmacies and pharmacy benefits managers, have been pressured by the specter of Amazon entering the space.
Some in the industry have doubted the tech giant will make the decision to compete in pharmacy; at the Forbes Healthcare Summit Wednesday, Walgreens Boots Alliance CEO Stefano Pessina suggested the regulatory hurdles may be too high.
""I believe that they will not come in an industry so complicated as our industry,"" Pessina said. ""I believe in the end they will use their technology in a different way.""
It's a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street and in the pharmaceutical industry. Many drug company executives, including the CEOs of Pfizer and Allergan, were asked about the prospect of working with Amazon on their most recent quarterly earnings conference calls. They responded enthusiastically but said no formal discussions were taking place.
Novartis, Mylan and Amazon declined to comment.

Amazon Web Services pop-up loft in San Francisco.
 The company is adding more than a thousand new features on Amazon Web Services including upgrades to storage and the replication of databases.
This ""confirms our view that AWS remains the clear leader in the cloud"" said JP Morgan's Douglas Anmuth. His note adds the new developments will help Amazon widen its lead over Microsoft's Azure and Google's Cloud Platform. ""We believe a key competitive advantage is AWS' seven year head start, and accelerated feature launches will make it tough for the competition to catch up,"" said Anmuth.
 Anmuth isn't the only analyst weighing in this morning. RBC's tech analyst Mark Mahaney writing in a note to investors, ""We are incrementally positive given AWS's scale, innovation and meaningful traction across key verticals.""
 Shares of Amazon are up a stunning 20 percent in just two months. For the year the stock is up 55 percent.
On another front JP Morgan's Anmuth notes Amazon's performance in Las Vegas may have an impact on the battle for artificial intelligence and machine learning, perhaps even erasing the perception of Google's lead in these areas.

 Cramer on Kroger: 'Death Star' Amazon wasn't going to 'wreck' its margins immediately   
 12:36  PM ET Thu, 30 Nov 2017 |  01:38 
 Kroger's quarterly earnings were ""impressive,"" and show that pressure from Amazon wasn't going to deter major grocery chains immediately, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.
 Shares of Kroger were more than 9 percent higher Thursday, trading around $26.70, after the company reported higher-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings and upbeat same-store sales. The company said aggressive discounting lured more customers to its stores.
""It's incredible. You'd think they must be getting taken over,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street"" about Kroger's stock rise. 
 Earlier Thursday, Kroger's chief financial officer, Michael Schlotman, told CNBC that the company's results are a reflection of its work to ""redefine the grocery shopping experience.""
The Cincinnati-based supermarket chain, which also owns Ralphs and Harris Teeter, has been lowering prices at its stores and has sought ways to work more with local brands. That comes as it faces competition from Wal-Mart and a merged Amazon and Whole Foods.
""There were a lot of people short Kroger,"" said Cramer, the host of CNBC's ""Mad Money."" ""They didn't understand that Amazon tomorrow is not going to wreck Kroger's margins.""
""'Death Star' is going to hurt things,"" Cramer said, referring to Amazon. ""But you have to see the whites of their eyes. I mean they didn't destroy Kroger the moment they bought 400 stores of Whole Foods.""
Cramer said if he were Kroger, he'd be more concerned about Wal-Mart. ""Because, Wal-Mart is the biggest grocer,"" he said. In October, Wal-Mart announced changes to its grocery business, including plans to add 1,000 online grocery pickup locations at its U.S. stores in fiscal 2019.

 Express Scripts CEO: Pharmacy-benefit manager model never needed more than now   
 8:10  AM ET Thu, 30 Nov 2017 |  03:15 
 Express Scripts had a word of caution for Amazon as it weighs its push into the multibillion-dollar pharmacy market.
 ""What [Amazon] will see is the magic isn't in lower net prices to consumers. It's getting the right drug to consumers and helping them navigate the system — all things we've built a business over 30 years to do,"" Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC on Thursday.
CNBC reported in May that Amazon was hiring in an effort to figure out how to break into a market, which Wentworth called highly competitive. While not a done deal, Wentworth said he is ""confident"" Amazon is examining an entrance, ""as they should be.""
 Wentworth said he sees Amazon more as a potential partner, rather than as a threat to Express Scripts' current share of the market.
""We have a tremendous e-commerce business with almost $30 billion in mail-service prescriptions being done with digital interfaces,"" Wentworth said.
He said 85 percent of Express Scripts' prescriptions are filled out online. But when asked whether he was talking to Amazon, Wentworth dodged the question.
""We talk with all kinds of folks all the time, and I won't talk about any particular set of conversations,"" Wentworth added.

 It's been a tough week for the FAANG stocks — though a few bounced back today. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet are all down for the week, anywhere from roughly 1 percent to 4 percent.
 That doesn't sound like much, but when you're dealing with this group, you're in the biggest league of them all in terms of market capitalization. When they move, they move indexes, and they can make, and lose, a lot of money for investors. Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon were four of the five biggest negative drags on the S&P 500 this week.
Let me show you what I'm talking about. Collectively, the five FAANG stocks had a market capitalization of about $2.8 trillion at the end of last week. The entire value of the U.S. stock market was about $28 trillion, meaning the FAANG stocks were about 10 percent of the market cap of the entire stock market.
 FAANG vs. the market (market capitalization)
FAANG stocks: $2.8 trillion
U.S. market capitalization $28 trillion
But this week the total market value of the FAANG stocks dropped to about $2.75 trillion, a loss of about $60 billion in market cap. Facebook and Apple alone are down about $17 billion each, followed by Google at nearly $15 billion, and Amazon and Netflix with smaller declines.
FAANG Market cap declines (this week)
Facebook $17.8 billion
Apple $17.7 billion
Google $14.7 billion
Amazon $6.6 billion
Netflix $3.1 billion
Total: $60.0 billion
The good news is that this group stabilized on Thursday. And for the year, they are all up, as much as 56 percent for Amazon and 32 percent for Alphabet. Four have at least doubled and in some cases tripled the S&P 500's 18 percent gain. It will be interesting to see  how much longer can that continue, even with outsized revenue growth.

 Wall Street is giddy over Amazon shares, gets its most bullish call yet: $1,500 price target   
 11:36  AM ET Thu, 30 Nov 2017 |  01:05 
 Multiple analysts raised their price targets for Amazon shares due to growing optimism over the internet giant's retail and cloud computing prowess.
 D.A. Davidson reiterated its buy rating and increased its price target for Amazon shares to $1,500 from $1,300, representing 29 percent upside to Wednesday's close. It is the highest target out of the 41 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet.
""We are focusing on the company's physical store efforts as we believe its increased physical footprint (including 465 Whole Foods locations, around 10 book stores, and its strategic partnership with Kohl's) is THE story of its 2017 holiday sales and an indication of things to come in the future as Amazon increasingly leverages physical stores to increase its revenue growth and wallet share,"" analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.

 MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson reaffirmed his buy rating and raised his price target for Amazon shares to $1,350 from $1,275.
""We continue to think Amazon is the best long-term growth story available to large-cap investors today,"" he wrote in a note Thursday.
Amazon shares are up 5 percent this month on growing optimism over its e-commerce retail sales and its annual cloud computing AWS re:Invent conference held in Las Vegas this week.
Sanderson predicts Amazon's subscription, third-party seller services and cloud computing businesses will grow sales more than 30 percent annually during the next two years.
JPMorgan also reiterated its overweight rating Wednesday for Amazon shares due to its Amazon Web Services cloud computing segment.
""We believe a key competitive advantage is AWS' seven-year head start, and accelerated feature launches as highlighted today make it tough for the competition to catch up,"" analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note to clients.
Amazon shares have rallied 55 percent this year through Wednesday, compared with the market's 17 percent gain.
The company's stock was up 0.7 percent in early trading Thursday.

Nest Thermostat
 Alphabet is thinking about bringing Nest Labs — maker of the Nest smart thermostat and other home products — back under its Google hardware umbrella, The Wall Street Journal said Wednesday.
 Nest is currently owned by Alphabet but is operated under Alphabet's ""Other Bets"" product category instead of directly under Google. The company is best known for its line of smart thermostats, but also sells connected cameras, a smoke alarm and a CO2 detector.
While Nest was relatively quiet in recent years, it launched several new products in 2017, including new Nest IQ models of its connected cameras, a more affordable Nest Thermostat E and the Nest Guard home security system.
 The move could help it fight against Amazon, which is encroaching on the connected home space with the Amazon Cloud Cam smart camera and a new in-home delivery system called Amazon Key.
Nest has had its share of ups and downs. In June, Reuters reported that Alphabet was considering a sale of its Nest unit in 2016 for about $3.2 billion. Last year, the CEO of Nest, Tony Fadell, departed the company.
Google has increased its focus on hardware — it now sells smartphones, Google Home smart speakers and more — and bringing Nest back under the same roof will make it easier for the two teams to collaborate.
Google and Nest declined comment to CNBC.

 });Investor Warren Buffett's net worth has surpassed $81 billion and yet, for all his business success, the self-made billionaire still regrets some missed opportunities. One of them is not investing in Amazon when he had the chance.
 At Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in May, Buffett said he wished he had chosen Amazon as his value tech stock instead of IBM. As he then told CNBC, he was ""too dumb"" to have seen the potential in the e-commerce giant. 
He largely avoided newer tech stocks such as Amazon and Google because he didn't fully appreciate their value. ""That's cost people a lot of money at Berkshire,"" he said.
 In retrospect, Buffett realized, ""I did not think [founder Jeff Bezos] could succeed on the scale he has. [I] underestimated the brilliance of the execution.""

 Amazon is currently experiencing massive success. Its stock has risen nearly 5 percent over the past week following a projected $6.59 billion in Cyber Monday sales. According to financial website How Much, if you bought $1,000 in Amazon stock in 2007, your investment would be worth $12,398 as of October 31 of this year.

 Bezos is now estimated to be the richest man in the world with a net worth of over $90 billion, slightly ahead of Buffett himself.
Despite having missed out on investing in Amazon, though, Buffett says taking some calculated risks is key to success. ""You'll see plenty of times when you get chances to do things that just shout at you,"" he said in a 1998 University of Washington panel discussion. ""When that happens, you have to take a big swing.""
He added, ""When you find something where you know the business, it's within your circle of competence, the price is right, the people are right, then you take your thumb out of your mouth and you barrel in.""

 Buffett calls Jeff Bezos ‘the most remarkable business person of our age’

 If you're looking to barrel into the stock market yourself, Buffett, along with other experienced investors like Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins, suggest starting with index funds.
Index funds hold every stock in an index such as the S&P 500 and offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills. They fluctuate with the market, which can lower the risks that can come from picking individual stocks.
Try to make some connections with people seasoned in the field, too, as opposed to solely relying on computer algorithms and research, John D. Spooner writes in his book, ""No One Ever Told Us That: Money And Life Lessons For Young Adults.""
Spooner argues that building real-life relationships helped Buffett triumph.
""Buffett dispenses wisdom and common sense wherever he goes. He has a cult following, in my view,"" Spooner writes, ""not just because he has an outstanding investment record, but also because of his wisdom, experience and counsel.
""As you get older, you suddenly realize you [may not] have the time to invest on your own. You need hands-on advice, not virtually, not by robots, but by real live smart people who consider the best interest of you and your family. Tough to find. But it can be priceless if you do.""

Amazon chief technology officer Werner Vogels speaks at the 2017 Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference in Las Vegas.
 As CNBC reported on Wednesday, Amazon's market-leading cloud business has introduced Alexa for Business, a set of tools for using the Alexa voice-activated virtual assistant at work. 
 Speaking at Amazon Web Services' annual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas on Thursday, Werner Vogels, Amazon's chief technology officer, talked about new tools for managing the use of Alexa devices within companies.
There are new integrations with Microsoft Exchange, RingCentral, Salesforce and SAP Concur and SuccessFactors software, among other things, Vogels said. And administrators will be able to manage Alexa-enabled devices and third-party skills that are available to end users. Administrators can even provide ""private"" skills, Vogels said. 
 ""Voice is the first disruption that will be driven by the capabilities of sort of the deep learning tools that we're giving you,"" said Vogels, who reports to AWS CEO Andy Jassy.
More details on the news are available in an Amazon blog post.

58,2017-12-01,"Jeff Bezos congratulates his Amazon team for winning a Guinness World Record in chicken-wing eating  Wells Fargo raises its Amazon price target to Street-high on cloud computing announcements  Cramer: Macy and other retailers are 'defying' the intrusion of Amazon  Amazon chart is flashing a sell signal, says technician  Amazon considers entry into pharmacy space  Amazon holding talks to explore pharma space entry  Faber Report: Amazon unlikely to sell generic drugs anytime soon  This Day in History, December 1, 2107  ","Most of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' relatively few Instagram posts highlight milestones achieved by his various teams. For example, he posted an update to the construction of a facility where Blue Origin rockets will be built and another promoted the latest Amazon wind farm.
 But his latest post stands out: Bezos congratulates his Amazon Web Services team on setting a Guinness World Record for the largest chicken-wing-eating competition. Yup. A chicken-wing-eating competition!
 The competition happened on Nov. 29 in Las Vegas. The Amazon Web Services team achieved the title with 214 participants, according to an email confirming the record to CNBC Make It from Guinness World Records. 
 While the chicken-wing competition may seem, at first glance, a silly post for a man worth almost $100 billion, it's a brilliant leadership strategy right out of the playbook of management guru Jack Welch.
 According to Welch, the three tenants of good leadership include setting a vision, being direct  — and making the work environment fun. In his two decades at the helm of General Electric, Welch grew revenues to $130 billion from $25 billion and profit to $15 billion from $1.5 billion. Market capitalization ballooned to $400 billion, growing by a multiple of 30.

 });
 Since retiring, Welch has launched the online-only business school, the Jack Welch Management Institute. This year, its MBA program was ranked one of the best by  Princeton Review.
Your team needs to feel like the office is the ""the cool kid's basement,"" says Welch, speaking at the Synergy Global forum in New York City. ""If you have a unit, you want the six people in your unit to think they have the world by the a-- and the same thing if you have a 400,000-person GE.""
That's because, ""It's not about me, it's about them. The workers,"" Welch says. ""Am I making them so excited they hate being home on the weekend — they want to be in here, working? Am I making it so much damn fun here? Am I celebrating every little victory with a keg of beer or something else?"" says Welch.
 ""We had kegs before you could spell Silicon Valley,"" he adds, referring to the tech mecca famous for its perks. ""I am telling you, you have got to make your place ... the place everybody wants to be.""
The chicken-wing-eating competition happened the same week as the Amazon Web Services re:Invent conference, also in Las Vegas. Throughout the week, AWS has been making announcements including scoring Time Warner's Turner broadcast unit as a client and launching a camerawith artificial intelligence. The team's work has impressed at least one high profile analyst.

Attendees at Amazon.com annual cloud computing conference walk past the Amazon Web Services logo in Las Vegas, November 30, 2017.
 One Wall Street analyst is getting more bullish on Amazon's cloud computing business.
 Wells Fargo reiterated its overweight rating and increased its price target on Amazon shares to $1,525 from $1,430, representing 30 percent upside to Thursday's close. It is the highest target out of the 41 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet.
Amazon held its annual cloud computing AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas this week.
 ""We are increasing our Amazon price target … on higher outer-year AWS [Amazon Web Services] estimates and a higher SOTP [sum of the parts] value,"" analyst Ken Sena wrote in a note to clients Friday. There were ""numerous announcements at this week's AWS re:Invent Conference, particularly around AI / ML where AWS appears to be strengthening their position within the market.""
Amazon shares have rallied 57 percent this year through Thursday, compared with the market's 18 percent gain. Sena said Amazon's newly announced SageMaker product is a ""game-changer"" for the machine learning [ML] and the artificial intelligence market.
""SageMaker allows one to build, train, validate, and deploy different models with incredible ease,"" he wrote. It ""solves one of the biggest human demands in ML.""
As a result, the analyst raised his 2019 sales estimate for Amazon Web Services by 3 percent to $31.3 billion.
Amazon stock declined 0.6 percent shortly after Friday's market open.
Sena's price forecast increase comes after multiple other Amazon analysts raised their price targets in the previous two days.

 Cramer: Macy's and other retailers are 'defying' this season   
 11:08  AM ET Fri,  1 Dec 2017 |  00:47 
 Despite concerns about what impact Amazon will have on other retailers this holiday season, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday that several groups are ""defying"" the intrusion of the online e-commerce giant.
 Cramer was particularly surprised by the news on Friday morning that department store operator Macy's said it had a strong start to the holiday shopping season and will hire additional workers in anticipation of the demand continuing through Christmas.
""Don't you think it's interesting that Macy's strong traffic leads Macy to hire 7,000 more holiday workers?"" Cramer asked on ""Squawk on the Street.""
 Shares of Macy's were up 1.2 percent Friday after the announcement. Despite the rise, Macy's is down more than 32 percent this year, according to FactSet.
Analysts had said this holiday season was a crunch time for Macy's, which has suffered share losses to online rivals, including Amazon.
""This group is defying. It's defying what we thought,"" said Cramer, host of CNBC's ""Mad Money."" ""Whether it be Kroger against the Death Star. Whether it be Macy's against the Death Star. Whether it be Walgreens against the Death Star.""
Cramer describes Amazon as the Death Star in ""Star Wars.""
Earlier this week, Cramer said Kroger's quarterly earnings proved that Amazon wasn't going to ""wreck"" the supermarket chain's margins so soon after the online retail giant's acquisition of Whole Foods.
""There were a lot of people short Kroger,"" Cramer said Thursday. ""They didn't understand that Amazon tomorrow is not going to wreck Kroger's margins.""

Amazon’s amazing run is headed for trouble, technical strategist says  ","Amazon employs over half a million workers. In the past year alone, the online retailer has added roughly a quarter of a million employees to its headcount, and 238 cities across the country are competing to become the location of Amazon's second headquarters, which is estimated to create 50,000 more Amazon jobs.
 But according to Dave Edwards and Helen Edwards at Quartz, Amazon may be killing more jobs than it creates. Quartz found that there are 170,000 fewer retail jobs in Amazon-related industries — like bookstores, grocery stores and clothing stores — in 2017 than the year before.
According to their calculations, even if Amazon maintains an impressive 43 percent personnel growth for another year, the total number of workers employed in Amazon-related industries would still decrease by 24,000.
 So where are the jobs going?  Quartz suggests that an increase in robotic workers could be to blame. They estimate that Amazon added 75,000 new robots to their workforce in 2017 for a total of roughly 100,000. By these approximations, machines constitute 20 percent of all Amazon ""employees.""
More robots don't always mean fewer jobs, but it may in the case of Amazon.  Edwards and Edwards write, ""While it may be difficult to prove causality, it's not difficult to see the correlation between a decline of 24,000 human employees and an increase of 75,000 robot employees.""

 Amazon attests that the investment in technological workers has improved efficiency. CNBC reports it takes 90 minutes on average for a human Amazon employee to find a product and package it, but with the help of robots, a product can be found and packaged in as little as 13 minutes. 
This efficiency is one reason why investors are so excited about Amazon. Even though the S&P Retail Index has remained relatively flat in 2017, Amazon's stock is up 57 percent. 
CNBC's Jim Cramer says that growth like this is going to lead Amazon to continue to invest in robotics and artificial intelligence in the coming year. ""They're going to have robots building robots,"" he says. ""And then we're really going to have nothing.""

Shoppers at a Costco Wholesale store in East Peoria, Illinois.
 Traditional brick-and-mortar retailers are showing signs of life at a time when a lot of people had written them off.
 Costco Wholesale, Ross Stores and Dollar Tree, among others, hit all-time highs on Monday. The SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund (XRT) also rose sharply, trading about 3 percent higher.
""There is life after Amazon. We're just figuring that out,"" said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics. ""Black Friday and Cyber Monday were particularly strong for brick-and-mortar.""
 The chart below shows the retailers that hit record highs on Monday and how they fared during the session:
 #dw-chart{width: 100%;height: 500px;border: none;padding-top: 32px;box-sizing: border-box;-moz-box-sizing: border-box;-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;}jQuery(document).ready(function($){var iframe=document.getElementById(""dw-chart"");$(window).on(""orientationchange"",function(){iframe.src=iframe.src;});});
 Traditional retailers have bounced back sharply since the start of the holiday shopping season.  The National Retail Federation said last week more than 174 million Americans shopped in stores and online from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday, surpassing expectations.
The bounce comes at a time when many investors and analysts have given up on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. For years, the rise of online shopping has taken market share away from these companies. E-commerce giant Amazon has been perhaps the biggest beneficiary of this change.
But the XRT is up nearly 7 percent since Black Friday. Chaikin also noted that Wal-Mart's third-quarter earnings report — which crushed analyst expectations — showed analysts and investors that ""it was possible to exist"" and compete as a brick-and-mortar retailer.
Wal-Mart traded down 0.3 percent but remained near an all-time high on Monday. Gap, meanwhile, hit its highest level since 2015. Macy's and O'Reilly Automotive shares were up 5.2 percent and 5.7 percent, respectively. Macy's and O'Reilly, however, are still down for the year, and the XRT is barely positive for the year.
Jeff Kilburg, CEO of KKM Financial, said retail's recent bounce was more a factor of sector rotation in the stock market, however. ""We have seen technology dominate in 2016 and 2017 [while] we've seen retail beaten down and bruised,"" he said. ""I think people are trying to find value and are scraping the laggards of 2017.""
Despite the resurgence brick-and-mortar retailers have shown recently, some are skeptical about whether they can keep this up.
Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors, called this a ""dead-cat bounce,"" adding traditional retailers will continue to ""lose more market share to online retailers.""

 Former Aetna CEO: Here's what triggered CVS to buy Aetna   
 5:27  PM ET Mon,  4 Dec 2017 |  03:20 
 There are three things that are triggering the CVS-Aetna deal and one of them is Amazon, former Aetna CEO John Rowe told CNBC on Monday.
 CVS Health will acquire Aetna for about $69 billion in cash and stock, the two companies announced on Sunday.
The deal would combine CVS' pharmacy business and pharmacy-benefit-manager platform (PBM) with Aetna's insurance business.
 ""Both of these companies are trying to increase their footprint in health care,"" Rowe said in an interview with ""Closing Bell.""
The deal comes as ecommerce giant Amazon looks to enter the industry, holding preliminary talks with generic-drug makers. 
""It's not quite explicit yet what they're planning on doing but whatever it is, it's scaring CVS,"" Rowe said about Amazon.
Another thing spurring the deal is United Healthcare, which ""has had some success with their integrated model of a payer provider,"" he added.
Lastly, he thinks the failure of recent horizontal mergers, like Aetna-Humana deal, has forced companies to think more vertically across sectors to increase their footprint.
The CEOs of Aetna and CVS both told CNBC on Monday that the merger will reduce health-care costs for consumers immediately. 
Rowe believes there are two areas that will see costs reduced — at the point of care at CVS Minute Clinics and in premiums.
""The infusion of millions of Aetna members into CVS program is going to give them more leverage with the drug wholesalers,"" he said.

 Amazon shouldn't scare you out of entire areas, like grocery stocks   
 7:05  PM ET Mon,  4 Dec 2017 |  01:06 
 It's been less than six months since Amazon announced its deal to buy Whole Foods, but for CNBC's Jim Cramer and many of the country's supermarket chains, it's felt like years.
 ""On that fateful day, June 16, the whole supermarket sector got beaten to a pulp, with many of the grocers seeing their stocks fall 5 to 10 percent in a single session,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The whole group suddenly needed to be re-rated lower now that the retail Death Star had them in its crosshairs.""
Initially, the declines were brutal: Supervalu shed 14.4 percent, Kroger dropped 9.2 percent, Costco fell 7.2 percent, Sprouts sank 6.3 percent and Target and Wal-Mart each slid about 5 percent.
 The grocers' weakness continued for several months. Cramer said that it felt ""like an Armageddon"" for the group, which saw Amazon as the ultimate bringer of doom.
But lately, the cohort has reversed, with many of the leading stocks up 20 to 40 percent from their summer lows.
Oddly enough, much of the group is trading above where it was before Amazon announced the Whole Foods deal, so Cramer investigated to find out what the positive action might mean.
""How is it that supermarket stocks have managed to rebound? Isn't Amazon totally toxic to anyone it competes with?"" he wondered. ""Sure, nobody in their right mind wants to go up against Amazon — I mean, maybe CVS did this big deal with Aetna because they're worried — but entire industries don't come undone in a single day.""
Simply, Wall Street got ahead of itself, the ""Mad Money"" host said. As soon as Amazon made its takeover public, analysts raced to slash their estimates on every possible competitor.
What they didn't account for was the near term. Amazon has yet to expand Whole Foods' several hundred stores to a level that truly competes with local supermarkets, even though it would likely pose a serious threat once that was complete, Cramer said.
The grocers' latest earnings results only confirmed that the analysts jumped the gun. Kroger delivered strong results last week. Supervalu beat Wall Street estimates in October. Costco reported better-than-expected earnings and Sprouts. Target and Wal-Mart followed suit.
Additionally, Wal-Mart upped its forecast and announced a $20 billion stock buyback, a whopping 8.5 percent of its market cap at the time.
Still, Cramer acknowledged that the long-term outlook is bleak for some. Supervalu, for one, was too risky for him to recommend, even though he felt more secure about Kroger, Sprouts, Costco and Wal-Mart (which he saw as the only true challenger to Amazon).
And with corporate tax cuts on the horizon, Cramer said that he couldn't blame the buyers who believe that the worst is over for the supermarket chains, which may soon pay lower tax rates.
""Here's the bottom line: when Amazon declares war on a particular industry, it's not an immediate death sentence for the incumbent players,"" Cramer concluded. ""Sure, Amazon crushed the bookstores and the record stores, but it took many, many years to play out and their balance sheets weren't as good as some of these. That's why the sell-off in the supermarket stocks ... was excessive, and why I think these stocks can continue to climb even after the huge rebounds that they've already had.""

 Cramer Remix: Wal-Mart is Amazon’s only long-term challenger in retail   
 7:04  PM ET Mon,  4 Dec 2017 |  01:13 
 It's been less than six months since Amazon announced its deal to buy Whole Foods, but for CNBC's Jim Cramer and many of the country's supermarket chains, it's felt like years.
 ""On that fateful day, June 16, the whole supermarket sector got beaten to a pulp, with many of the grocers seeing their stocks fall 5 to 10 percent in a single session,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Initially, the declines were brutal. But lately, the cohort has reversed, with many of the leading stocks, including Wal-Mart and Target, up between 20 and 40 percent from their summer lows.
 Simply, Wall Street got ahead of itself, Cramer said. As soon as Amazon made its takeover public, analysts raced to slash their estimates on every possible competitor.
What they didn't account for was the near term, and the grocers' latest earnings results only confirmed that the analysts jumped the gun.
Wal-Mart, for example, hit all-time highs after it upped its forecast and announced a $20 billion stock buyback, a whopping 8.5 percent of its market cap at the time.
""If you want a major player where groceries are just one part of the equation, I definitely favor Wal-Mart over Target,"" Cramer said. ""Long term, Wal-Mart is the only retailer with the heft to truly challenge Amazon. It's also got the leadership to pull it off thanks to CEO Doug McMillon.""

 Cramer was loathe to accredit the Dow's record day to the fundamentals.
""This is not a rally,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said on Monday. ""This is really a redistribution. It's not a bet on the future, it's a wager that some earnings estimates are going higher while others just stay the same.""
In other words, Monday's market rotation was ""100 percent about tax reform,"" Cramer said. The successful passage of the tax reform bill in the Senate brings domestic companies closer to a large, earnings-additive tax cut.
But more internationally oriented companies, like most of tech, don't get much of a boost except for repatriation, which is why the tech-heavy Nasdaq suffered as the Dow rose, Cramer said.
""It's like Congress has waved a magic wand at every cable company, railroad, retailer and restaurant, as well as a smattering of industrials that have great U.S. exposure, and that wand has radically raised earnings for 2018,"" Cramer said.
 Merger mania
 Cameron Costa | CNBC
Larry Merlo, CEO of CVS and Mark Bertolini, CEO of AETNA appear on Squawk Box on Dec. 4th, 2017.
 Cramer has found that certain companies have started to ""change the narrative"" with strategic mergers and acquisitions when doubt falls on their well-being.
""Today we got two classic changes of narrative, one from Disney and the other from CVS Health,"" Cramer said, referring to Disney's revived deal talks with Twenty-First Century Fox and CVS' $69 billion deal to buy health insurer Aetna.
If Disney and Fox's talks prove successful, Disney would acquire Fox's non-news, non-sports assets to bolster its entertainment offerings. CVS plans to integrate Aetna's network into its own to become a massive, one-stop shop for pharmacy benefits and clinical care.
Cramer said that ""both are defensive deals,"" with Disney itching to get out from under its ESPN subscriber weakness and the cord-cutting fears that have plagued the old-line media giant.
 Yext CEO on AI business
 Scott Mlyn | CNBC
Howard Lerman, CEO, Yext
 Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing how consumers browse the web, and behind the scenes, software company Yext is perfecting the details, Yext co-founder and CEO Howard Lerman told CNBC.
""We are witnessing a major platform shift, the rise of conversational artificial intelligence services like Alexa and Siri and Google Assistant,"" Lerman told Cramer on Monday. ""Each of these services needs knowledge to give you an answer. If you ask Google Assistant how many calories are in a Big Mac, she needs to know the answer to tell you. And Yext lets companies manage all their deep digital knowledge in the cloud and automatically sync it to over 100 services.""
While companies can't control Google's interface or A.I. capabilities, they can control the details they provide to the search giant. That's where Yext comes in, particularly for larger companies where managing data can prove exceedingly difficult, Lerman said.
""Volvo just signed up with Yext about six months ago,"" the CEO said. ""They revealed, at our annual user conference, Onward, this year, that we've corrected more than 50,000 data errors since they signed up with us.""
 Lightning Round: Cooling off on LRCX
 In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
Lam Research Corporation: ""You've got to go over what Katy Huberty said, from Morgan Stanley. She's saying that flash is going to roll over. Lam makes machines to make flash. If that's the case, then that stock is rolling over, too, and it makes a lot of sense. I happen to think Lam's a great company, but I'm not going to stick my head in the Lam lion's den, not yet. I've got to wait to see it go to where all the sellers are done, and the panicked sellers are still very much in there.""
Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.: ""I think that what you have to do first is go with the traditionals. You have to buy an Intel or a Texas Instruments before you go down the food chain like this, because that's what's going to bottom first.""

 Amazon chart is flashing a sell signal, says technician   
 1:53  PM ET Mon,  4 Dec 2017 |  05:30 
 Shares of Amazon have been under pressure, and the charts are pointing to more downside, according to one technical strategist.  The stock posted its first negative week after five-straight weeks of gains, its longest winning streak since March. Despite the impressive streak, Amazon is showing signs of short-term exhaustion around Black Friday, and a further near-term pullback is likely, said Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG. Her analysis follows a bullish breakout in late October.
 ""We're really viewing the pullback as something that should be short lived, but should persist in the days ahead just based on the proximity of support on the chart, which is a bit lower based on the breakout point,"" Stockton said Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""  David Seaburg, head of sales and trading at Cowen, agrees that Amazon shares have indeed been ""fatigued"" lately, but said the broader picture is positive for the stock, which has advanced 55 percent this year.  ""Last quarter they reported and they really show that their investment ... is actually producing some top-line results, so people are really comfortable with the investments they're making, and I think the long-term story is absolutely intact,"" he said. Amazon shares fell a little over 1 percent on Friday. They were up 0.6 percent in Monday's premarket.

 Freeman came back to the company for family reasons and is currently part of the Alexa team, according to people familiar with the matter. Freeman's LinkedIn page says he rejoined Amazon in March 2017 to work on a ""new initiative.""
Freeman is now in charge of Alexa communications service, which covers video calling, calling and messaging features, a person familiar with the matter said.
 Freeman, a longtime Amazon Video executive, mostly worked on the engineering side, although he was responsible for the entire video team before his sudden departure last year. Roy Price, former head of Amazon Studios, used to report to Freeman, as did Jay Marine, vice president of Prime Video Europe, The Information reported last year.
Freeman's addition to Alexa underscores Amazon's focus on incorporating video with its widely popular voice-assistant technology. This year Amazon has released two new video devices under the Echo line (Echo Show and Echo Look) and new services, such as Alexa for Business and Amazon Chime, which enable video conferencing through its Alexa voice assistant.
While it's unclear exactly what new initiative Freeman is working on, he's expanding his team. Freeman's LinkedIn page says he's hiring in Seattle, Chennai, Toronto, Gdansk, Ottawa, and Phoenix.

 Amazon appears to have canceled a pharmaceutical wholesaler application in the state of Maine, analysts at RBC Capital Markets pointed out Tuesday, raising further questions about the tech giant's plans to enter the pharmacy space.
 The Maine Board of Pharmacy website shows an application from Amazon.com was canceled on Dec. 1, RBC analysts George Hill, Stephen Hagan and Lee Lueder wrote in a research note. Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Analysts: Amazon getting into health care is 'a given'   
 11:40  AM ET Mon,  4 Dec 2017 |  03:47 
 The news that Amazon had acquired wholesale pharmacy licenses in multiple states, first reported in October by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, heightened already intense speculation that the company planned to compete in prescription drugs. But experts soon pointed out that the licenses didn't enable Amazon to distribute prescription medicines; instead they supported existing medical products businesses. 
 But RBC's analysts say Maine's regulations mean Amazon's licensing activities in the state could be a signal of its plans.
""In Maine, a medical device license was not needed for the sale of medical supplies so industry sources have implied the Maine license was a strong leading indicator of whether or not Amazon would enter the drug supply chain,"" RBC wrote. ""We see this cancellation as a negative indicator of the likelihood that Amazon enters pharmacy in the near term and thus as a positive for the pharmacies and drug supply chain.""
Speculation about Amazon's entry has weighed on stocks of drug distributors, pharmacy benefits managers and retail pharmacies.
Amazon has remained silent about what, if any, plans it may have for a bigger move into health care. CNBC reported last week that the company has engaged in exploratory discussions with makers of generic drugs about what role it could potentially play.

A worker prepares packages to be shipped inside of an Amazon fulfillment center in Robbinsville, New Jersey, November 27, 2017.
 A few weeks ago, Wyze Labs, a one-year-old start-up in Seattle, sent me its first gadget to try. It’s a small, internet-connected video camera, the kind you might use for security or to keep tabs on your dog or your baby.
On the surface, the camera doesn’t sound special. Like home internet cameras made by Nest or Netgear, the Wyze device can monitor an area for motion or sound. When it spots something, it begins recording a short clip that it stores online, for access on your phone or your computer.
But the WyzeCam has one groundbreaking feature that no rival can match. It is being sold for such an unbelievably low price — $20 — that it sent me tunneling into the global gadget industry to figure out how Wyze had done it. That, in turn, led to a revelation about the future of all kinds of products, from cameras to clothes.
 That future? We’re going to get better products for ludicrously low prices, and big brands across a range of categories — the Nests and Netgears of the world — are going to find it harder than ever to get us to shell out big money for their wares.
There’s a hidden hero in this story — or, if you’re a major brand, a shadowy villain. It’s Amazon.
To understand Amazon’s role, let’s take a closer look at how Wyze piggybacked off Amazon. Nest’s and Netgear’s comparable indoor cameras sell for around $200 each, while Wyze’s device goes for $20 plus shipping if you buy directly from the company’s website. The only other place to purchase the WyzeCam is on Amazon, where members of the company’s Prime service can get it for $30 including two-day shipping.
Wyze did not create a home internet camera for a tenth of the price of rivals by skimping on quality. Though the camera comes in extremely spare packaging, it otherwise offers many features you would expect in big-brand devices, including tough security. (Although all internet-connected devices pose some security risk, Wyze said its devices and the data they recorded were locked down with encryption.)
Wyze’s low prices are instead born of two ideas, both connected to Amazon. The company’s three founders all worked at the retail giant, and they said they had been inspired by Amazon’s high-volume, low-margin approach to sales.
To hit the $20 price, Wyze licensed the camera’s hardware from a Chinese company, then created its own software. It also cut out just about every middleman, including most retailers. And it’s banking on long-run success. While Wyze is just breaking even on its first camera, its founders believe internet-connected home devices will be a growth category. They plan to establish a trusted brand with the first camera, then release a succession of products that they hope to sell in large numbers, at low prices.
But how do you establish a brand online? That’s the second place Amazon comes in.
Though they snubbed every other retailer, Wyze’s founders recognized that they needed an Amazon storefront to help them establish an instant presence next to the big guys. Customer rankings and reviews on Amazon have become just about the most important factor in how consumers buy electronics products; because Amazon pages come up high on search results like Google’s, a positive rating on Amazon can effectively make a brand — and a negative rating can break one.
“That’s why we had to sell on Amazon,” said Yun Zhang, Wyze’s chief executive. “You just can’t ignore them.”
Wyze is now one of dozens of companies relying heavily on Amazon to create online brands. There’s Anker, which makes low-priced, well-regarded accessories for your electronics. There’s Yi, which makes, among other things, action cameras that rival GoPro.
And there are RAVPower, TaoTronics and VAVA, three consumer electronics brands that are all owned by Sunvalley Group. Sunvalley, a Chinese company, said it will exceed $300 million in sales this year, with about 90 percent coming through Amazon.
In an earlier time, you might have dismissed companies like these as “Chinese knockoffs.” After all, like Wyze, most of them use commodity parts and global manufacturing efficiencies to create low-priced versions of relatively uncomplicated products.
But knockoffs get a bad rap because they are of indeterminate quality: Even if it’s selling at a good price, who wants to risk buying a no-name portable smartphone charger if it might blow up in your face? Allen Fung, the general manager of Sunvalley’s American division, said that what was unique about Amazon was that its store encouraged low prices while heavily penalizing companies that made shoddy products.
“It’s not a race to the bottom,” Mr. Fung said. “Sellers are forced to create better products at lower pricing, and sellers who aren’t able to do that just get weeded out.”
Mr. Fung recently spent a couple of hours providing an in-depth look at how he manages his company’s brands on Amazon. To win a certain product category — portable chargers, say, or children’s night lights — the company is obsessive about monitoring customer feedback, including the rate at which its products are returned. Sunvalley recently hired a team of customer service agents to respond to complaints. It has also hired industrial designers to improve the look of its devices — which also helps it stand out from other commodity devices on Amazon’s results page.
Sunvalley also spends heavily on Amazon ads (these show up as “sponsored” results on Amazon’s search page), and sometimes it will sell products at a loss during one of Amazon’s daily or seasonal deals to get a boost that lifts all of its products in the website’s search rankings.
All of these investments are costly and time-consuming, and competition on Amazon is intense. Mr. Fung said Sunvalley’s gross margins were under 25 percent, which is quite low for consumer electronics.
“It’s really tough,” he said. “There’s a real process of natural selection there.”
This process is not going to affect just the consumer electronics business. Mr. Fung said his teams regularly looked to Amazon as a kind of product road map — they look for categories dominated by high-priced items from well-known brands, and then try to create better, cheaper versions. Sunvalley has expanded into home appliances like lamps and humidifiers, as well as into cosmetics.
Amazon, which charges a fee for third-party companies to sell through its platform, is not a passive actor in this trend. It has long encouraged businesses to set up shop on its site. The company said that half of its products came from small businesses, and that in 2016, more than 100,000 businesses exceeded $100,000 in sales through its system. It also started a lending program to allow those businesses to scale up; last year, its loans exceeded $3 billion.
“As this takes off, it really makes you start to question, you know, what is a brand in the Amazon age?” said Scot Wingo, executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce consulting firm.
It’s an intriguing question, and one that raises fears of Amazon’s rise. While the growth of high-quality, low-priced brands on Amazon seems unquestionably good for consumers, the trend does produce economic losers.
The classic worry about Amazon is that it puts local retailers out of business. Now another worry is that by exposing global brands to the harsh reality of low-priced competitors, it may put them out of business, too. Mr. Wingo said global brands across a variety of categories — electronics, apparel, home improvement — regularly approached his company looking for a way to compete with low-priced rivals on Amazon.
He has had to let them know there’s no easy solution, he said.
“There is this erosion of what it means to be a traditional consumer product brand,” Mr. Wingo said. “In a way, Amazon is providing all this information that replaces what you’d normally get from a brand, like reputation and trust. Amazon is becoming something like the umbrella brand, the only brand that matters.”

 Cramer says the Amazon 'Death Star' is aimed at dental devices   
 11:31  AM ET Wed,  6 Dec 2017 |  02:21 
 Shares of dental supply distibutors sank Wednesday after Morgan Stanley issued a stark warning to investors: ""Amazon is here.""
 Dental supply distributors Henry Schein and Patterson Cos. both closed down more than 4 percent after analyst Steve Beuchaw said that Amazon is buying supplies directly from oral goods manufacturer Dentsply Sirona.
""We have new evidence that Amazon is accessing critical products from Dentsply Sirona,"" wrote Beuchaw on Tuesday. ""While Amazon makes up a small share of average total spending both backward (4 percent) and forward looking (5 percent), it was used by 34 percent of practitioners in our survey in the last year suggesting it is making inroads into many practices.""
 The analyst downgraded both suppliers to underweight from equal weight. Shares of Henry Schein fell 5 percent while shares of Patterson Companies slipped 4.7 percent.
""We are unaware of any market-leading dental manufacturer that has a direct relationship with Amazon,"" a Henry Schein spokesperson said. ""We believe that at this time Amazon is a minor player in the dental consumables markets, with an insignificant market penetration.""
For its part, Amazon offered the following statement for this story: ""We don't comment on individual relationships, but Amazon Business customers have a choice of products from numerous dental suppliers and manufacturers.""
Patterson Companies did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.
Many have speculated that Jeff Bezos and his company could try to disrupt the medical or pharmacy supply chain and undermine established distributors like Henry Schein and Patterson. By accessing dental supplies directly from a manufacturer like Dentsply Sirona, Amazon could work to deliver medical devices and products directly to dentists and other physicians.
Amazon indicates a majority of the dental products on its business-to-business portal are sourced directly from manufacturers, with the other 50 percent sourced by third parties, wrote the analyst in November, allowing a distributor of Dentsply Sirona products to resell via Amazon.

 Amazon Prime Video is now available on the Apple TV.
 The app and partnership was originally announced in June during Apple's annual developer conference.
It allows Amazon Prime members to stream a wide array of movies and TV shows, including exclusive content created by Amazon Studios such as The Grand Tour and The Man in the High Castle.
 The move will appeal to Apple TV owners, who now have access to more content. It also encroaches a bit on Netflix's territory. Netflix has been available on the Apple TV for years, and now there's content from a competitor to watch.
The app doesn't appear to be promoted on the Apple TV's home screen just yet, but can be found by searching through the App Store.

 Indian start-ups are looking to beat Facebook and Amazon in their own backyard   
 4:27  PM ET Wed,  6 Dec 2017 |  00:42 
 Many of India's top tech start-ups are establishing a lobbying group to push for governmental regulations to put an end to global companies' continued success in the country.
 The group, called Indiatech, will begin its operations early next year. Chief among its agenda is to coax the government in New Delhi into passing regulations to help local companies dominate the country's internet market, industry sources told CNBC.
The new group represents an aggressive new strategy for a local industry that has been scrambling to compete with global giants — and repeatedly come up short. If the lobbying efforts are successful, they could benefit domestic firms while squeezing out big-name companies like Amazon and Uber from the hugely promising market.
 Online retailer Flipkart, Uber rival Ola and messaging app Hike are among the Indian tech companies behind the new lobbying effort. Local grocery marketplace Grofers, travel booking service MakeMyTrip, online classifieds platform Quikr and VC firms Matrix and Kalaari have also joined the organization, people familiar with the matter said.
""If one of the participating members went to the government with a proposal of this kind, it will not be taken seriously,"" said one source with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity as he wasn't authorized to speak to the press. ""But if an industry lobby body, which represents nearly all of the local giants, makes a suggestion, it will be heard.""
 Stumbling unicorns
 On paper, Flipkart appears to have moved beyond its 2016 struggles to raise money: It  secured $4 billion from a myriad of global investors including SoftBank, Microsoft and eBay this year — albeit at a valuation of $11.6 billion from $15 billion two years ago.
But while Flipkart was struggling to raise capital, rival Amazon doubled down on its India bet by pumping $3 billion into the local operations. The announcement bolstered Amazon's total planned investment in the country, which it entered in 2013, to $5 billion.
The results of that strategy are clear: During the important festival of Diwali, a period traditionally crucial for retail companies in the country, Amazon India surpassed Flipkart in sales for the first time.
E-commerce isn't the only sector seeing a showdown: Other Indian unicorns such as ride-hailer Ola and messaging app Hike are also struggling to put up a strong fight against global rivals, such as Uber and Facebook's WhatsApp, respectively. Those firms, along with others from the U.S., China and Europe, have entered India with huge supplies of capital at their disposal.

 The darlings of India's tech startups have attempted to put up a brave front by offering lofty discounts and expanding their portfolios, but the formation of the lobbying group shows their new strategy is to seek the government's protection from the global onslaught.
The organization would convince the government to make the ""right policies, and bring to their notice the interventions and some decisions that will help us,"" an executive at one of the founding members of Indiatech said. ""The end goal is to help Indian companies get preferential treatment,"" the executive added, requesting anonymity.
It's worth noting that many of the start-ups seeking protectionist regulation have benefited from international investors. In fact, some of the biggest-name members in the lobbying group — Flipkart, Ola, Hike, Grofers and Quikr — share Japan's SoftBank as an investor.
""Our intent is to work with the government to support the development of the rapidly evolving Internet ecosystem in the country and we hope the organization would facilitate this,"" a SoftBank spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.
Flipkart, Hike and Grofers declined to elaborate to CNBC about the rationale behind participating in the Indiatech group.
 Protectionism
 Calls for the Indian government to intervene and protect local companies are part of a narrative in the making for more than a year. Notably, at a conference last December, Sachin Bansal, co-founder and executive chairman of Flipkart, suggested that the Indian government  should do ""what China did 15 years ago and tell the world we need your capital, but we don't need your companies.""
Also in attendance at that conference, Bhavish Aggarwal, the CEO and founder of Ola, echoed Bansal's suggestion: ""There is a narrative of innovation that non-Indian companies espouse, but the real fight is on capital, not innovation. The markets are being distorted by capital,"" he said at the time.
Their views were met with a mixed response from industry leaders, some of whom pointed out the irony that both Flipkart and Ola have raised much of their capital from foreign firms. Regardless, some say the stakes are too high for government inaction.
""If the government doesn't wake up, it will see Silicon Valley kill off a large segment of its entrepreneurship ecosystem and challenge its leading retail and technology companies,"" Vivek Wadhwa, tech entrepreneur and distinguished fellow at Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering, told CNBC.
""Foreign companies will gather massive amounts of private data about every Indian citizen — even more than the Indian government has. Facebook and Google will have the tools to sway Indian public opinion and affect elections. This is dangerous for any democracy,"" he added, saying he believed the government should learn from China, which he says realized very early on that if it allowed Silicon Valley giants to dominate its internet, they would hurt local companies.
Chinese companies are now rivals to Silicon Valley, and firms like Tencent and Alibaba lead the nation's internet market. Last month, China's Tencent hit a market capitalization of $500 billion.
Along those lines, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of e-commerce and electronic payment company Paytm, recently said in a Twitter post that ""India is effectively letting modern world East India Companies own its Internet.""
Alibaba-backed Paytm is facing heat from services by global companies. Its wallet application, used by over 200 million users in the country, has seen strong growth of late, but other companies are interested in moving in on the market. Google introduced Tez payments app for India in September, and it has already amassed 12 million customers, the company said. On top of that, Facebook's WhatsApp, used by more than 200 million users in India, is said to be considering plans to integrate a payment option in its app. Paytm declined to comment for this story.
Some warn, however, that replicating an approach similar to that of China could go terribly wrong.
""It is counterproductive to look at China selectively and cherry-pick parts of protectionism we like,"" said Prasanto Roy, vice president and head of the Internet, Mobile and E-commerce Council at the National Association of Software and Services Companies — an industry group set up in 1988 for India's then-nascent software and IT industry.
""Protectionism is a double-edged sword and any attempt at raising trade barriers could hurt more than help India if there is reciprocal action. Keep in mind that the $150 billion IT industry (two-third of it software and services exports) is premised on an open, non-protectionist global marketplace,"" he added.
Eyes are on the government now, but not everyone believes New Delhi would pass new laws to help local tech firms.
""The government wants investors and foreign companies to come to India and create more jobs and opportunities in the country. I don't think the government would take any action to hurt foreign companies in any way,"" said Satish Meena, an analyst at Forrester Research.
Officials at the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion weren't available to comment.
 A market in flux
 The recent arrivals of Amazon, Uber and Netflix in India and the aggressive expansions of businesses by Facebook, Microsoft and Google have changed the dynamics of the local market. Those global firms bring some services to the table that no Indian company rivals, but they're even gaining traction in categories in which domestic firms had a first-mover advantage.
In 2015, Flipkart and Snapdeal together accounted for 75 percent of the online retail market in India, according to financial services firm Morgan Stanley. Today, however, much has changed: Flipkart and Amazon India are jockeying to be market leader, and Snapdeal, which recently ended merger talks with Flipkart to no avail, has seen its market share collapsing.
In October, Amazon India announced it had more than 44 percent of total customer share and more than 42 percent of total transactions during the festival of Diwali, citing third-party data from market research firm Kantar. Amazon credited its Prime subscription service, which it launched in India last year, for helping it bolster sales.
 Chart: Amazon India's app recently surpassed Flipkart's app on the monthly active users milestone, figures from 7 Park Data suggest.
Similar is the fate of ride-hailing service Ola, which has been somewhat successful but only by burning capital at a fast clip to keep Uber at bay. It raised $1.1 billion this October from investors including Tencent and SoftBank at an estimated valuation of $7 billion, and it expects to raise an additional $1 billion in coming weeks.
That investment, a source familiar with the matter said, will be led by SoftBank, which plans to bet another $600 million on the company.
Ola maintains its market-leading position in the country, serving in more than 100 cities, but Uber is quickly catching up. Both the companies are trying to boost the number of rides on their platforms by subsidizing the cost of rides.
""We are growing incredibly fast, focusing on the metrics and features that matter the most: reliability, quick arrival times and the best customer service experience,"" an Uber spokesperson said. Ola declined to comment.
Uber India and Amazon India, for their part, have also fiercely slammed the notion that they are not Indian companies. Amazon India is a ""completely India registered entity, and as Indian as any other,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have consistently maintained our support for free support for capital movement. Free flow of capital is not only good for customers but also helps create jobs, develop infrastructure, aids the growth of small businesses and facilitates India's economic development.""
Uber India said it is ""led and staffed by local teams who know their cities better than anyone. We bring global expertise to India, but wouldn't have been able to get where we are today without a local-first approach.""
Uber has invested north of $1 billion in the country, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said at a recent conference that the company is in heavy investment mode in India.

 Cuban, who tries to always keep learning something new, says he constantly pushes himself to leave his comfort zone.
""Whether I've met with Steve Bannon, done 'Dancing With The Stars,' bought the [Dallas Mavericks], whatever the case may be, I just want to try new experiences and do different things,"" Cuban says during an interview on ""The Jamie Weinstein Show"" podcast.
 Cuban's in good company with the idea. It's a sentiment that Bezos echos.  
""Jeff Bezos — and I follow this to a T — I was reading, he said, 'Look, you don't want to be [80] years old and look back and ask yourself ... why didn't I do this? Why didn't I try it?"" Cuban says.

 });
 While speaking at the Summit Series conference in Los Angeles, Bezos revealed he was indeed thinking something similar when he quit his good job on Wall Street to found Amazon.
""For me, the best way to think about it was to project myself forward to age 80,"" Bezos says. ""When I'm 80 years old, I want to have minimized the number of regrets that I have. I don't want to be 80 years old, in a quiet moment of reflection thinking back over my life, and cataloging a bunch of major regrets.
""In most cases, our biggest regrets turn out to be acts of omission,"" he continues. ""It's paths not taken.""
That convinced him to take a risk and start Amazon, which now has a market cap of over $550 billion and has made him the richest person in the world.
""I decided I had to give it a shot,"" Bezos says in a  2010 baccalaureate address at Princeton. ""I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all.""
Cuban, worth $3.3 billion, agrees that pushing himself to experience new things has been worth it.
""Maybe it will come back to haunt me, all the fun I've had, but I've had fun,"" he says.

The Echo Plus looks premium, and almost identical to the original
 Amazon's Alexa voice technology is helping consumer brands sell more, according to a recent study, underscoring its potential as a major marketing platform.
 The study, run by Linc Global and Rakuten, shows that Echo owners increased their purchases of consumer products, like diapers, by 13.5% in the third quarter of 2017, up from the 7.5% jump seen in the second quarter of this year. Those companies also saw an unusually high 60% upsell rate, meaning the consumers bought more products from the same brand after their Echo purchase.
""This study indicates that voice search has a positive impact on sales of standardized products,"" James Lee, an analyst at Mizuho Securities wrote in a note published Wednesday.
 The broader takeaway, according to Lee, is that Alexa's voice technology could turn into a major marketing platform for consumer brands. For example, the note says Pamper diapers could build an Alexa app that recommends re-orders of previous purchases or new products based on past shopping history. 
Amazon is also testing a new service that would potentially let customers order products from the consumer brand's Alexa app and pick up at local retailers, according the Mizuho note.
""Alexa's voice platform provides a powerful marketing channel for brands to sell direct,"" Lee wrote in the note.

After dropping 20 percent in value last week, the digital currency topped $12,000 on Tuesday, reached $15,000 by early on Wednesday and, on Thursday, rocketed above $19,000 before falling and settling around $16,000 in the early afternoon. 
 Financial experts seem to agree: It's volatile. CNBC's Jim Cramer and self-made millionaire Tony Robbins both compared investing in it to gambling in Vegas. Billionaire Mark Cuban said buying the currency would be like ""throwing a Hail Mary.""
But if you decide to take that risk and put some money into it, where can you even spend bitcoin?
 A lot of places, but not everywhere.
Over 100,000 merchants worldwide accept bitcoin. Notable ones include Microsoft and Expedia, as well as the online electronics retailer Newegg.

 Considering that bitcoin is a digital currency, it's more rare for actual stores to accept it as a payment method. But, as CoinDesk points out, some business are beginning to, such as REEDS Jewelers, which has over 60 retail locations in eastern U.S.
Speaking of Vegas, the Golden Gates Hotel & Casino there accepts bitcoin payments at their hotels and restaurants but not yet for bets on the casino floor.

 Many major retailers such as Walmart and Amazon have yet to sign off on bitcoin as an accepted method of payment, but the mobile gift card app Gyft offers one way around that. You can use bitcoin to buy a gift card and then shop at those retailers or another one of the 200-some that they work with, including giants like Nike, Target and Starbucks.
Alternatively, you can also use a service like Shakepay to convert cryptocurrencies into USD or Euros for a fee. Last year, Mason Borda, the CEO of a cryptocurrency security firm called TokenSoft, outlined in a post on Medium how he used the service to pre-order a Tesla Model 3 with bitcoin.
So, although many retailers don't yet accept the cryptocurrency as a payment method, there are ways to make it work. Plus, it is rumored that Amazon might actually be preparing to change their policy and begin accepting bitcoin, which could, experts speculate, surge its value even higher.

Jeff Bezos speaking at the new New York Economic Club luncheon in New York on Oct. 27, 2016.
 While public support for President Donald Trump's tax plan remains low, there's reason for Amazon to feel giddy about it: an estimated $2 billion in tax savings over the next two years.
 That's based on a report by financial research firm Cowen & Co., which estimates Amazon will save $723 million in 2018 and $1.3 billion in 2019 under the proposed tax bill. In total, Amazon's earnings could see a 24% boost in each of the next two years, Cowen wrote in the note.
For comparison, Amazon is expected to make roughly $2.1 billion in net income this year alone, according to FactSet.
 Cowen's estimate puts Amazon's effective tax rate under the new plan at 13.2 percent, which is vastly lower than the 30 percent Amazon is estimated to be paying now. It also assumes the US corporate tax rate will drop to 22 percent starting January 1, 2018, and the new tax plan to have no other major impact on US businesses, including international tax rates.
Cowen added that the new tax bill could drive up earnings for other big tech companies. Google, for example, is estimated to save $2.3 billion and $2.7 billion in each of the next two years, while Facebook could save $1.6 billion and $2 billion over the same period, according to Cowen's note.

 Trump asked Cooperman if Amazon was a monopoly   
 5:29  PM ET Thu,  7 Dec 2017 |  01:05 
 President Donald Trump sought a billionaire investor's advice twice on whether he considered Amazon a monopoly during a dinner this summer, weeks before federal regulators signed off on the e-commerce giant's acquisition of Whole Foods Market.
 Leon Cooperman, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who runs the hedge fund Omega Advisors, said Thursday he attended a dinner with 10 people in July during which Trump twice asked him the monopoly question.
Cooperman, whose fund owned about $10.3 million of Amazon stock at the end of the third quarter, said his answer to the president was no.
 ""President Trump asked me twice if I thought Amazon was a monopoly and I said, 'No, Mr. President,'"" Cooperman recounted on CNBC's ""Halftime Report."" ""I think they've out-executed people. I think they've done a very good job.""

Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos
 Trump has repeatedly called out Amazon and its billionaire founder, Jeff Bezos, taking to his favorite forum, Twitter, to rail against the e-commerce company about not charging ""internet taxes."" (Amazon does collect state sales tax where it applies). He also likes to draw connections between Bezos' other major investment, The Washington Post, and Amazon.
In June, Amazon announced its head-turning $13.7 billion deal for the organic grocery chain, a move that sent shock waves through the retail sector. Amazon has been blamed for the demise of brick-and-mortar stores as consumer preferences have shifted to online shopping and home delivery.
Amazon started out as an online bookseller in the 1990s and has expanded to offer a vast array of products on its website. Whole Foods brought it into grocery and food, a $700 billion U.S. market, and gave it a springboard of 465 locations that can serve as distribution centers for a variety of products. Amazon is also thought to be exploring involvement in the pharmacy or medical devices industry and recently introduced a fashion platform. 
The Federal Trade Commission waved through the Whole Foods deal in August.
Trump appears to have reserved his antitrust fight for another giant deal: AT&T's pending purchase of Time Warner, which is now headed to court. Trump, who has also openly criticized Time Warner's CNN news channel, has said since his campaign he wouldn't allow that deal to go through because it concentrates too much power.
Antitrust is a major risk to Amazon and other technology giants such as Facebook and Google, Cooperman said. ""Governments are going to stick their beak into this thing, and that's a risk.""
The hedge-fund manager settled accusations of insider trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this year. Cooperman said Trump suggested at the dinner in July that the SEC case, filed in September 2016, was retaliation for an open letter Cooperman published to President Barack Obama in 2011 criticizing his perceived anti-Wall Street views.
""I changed the subject very quickly,"" Cooperman said of the Amazon monopoly discussion. ""He did say to me, ""Lee, you have a fabulous reputation, you think your open letter to President Obama created your SEC problems?'""
""I told him I didn't know,"" Cooperman recalled. ""'Mr. President, yes, he treated me very unfairly but I've got to get on with my life.'""

People demonstrate for net neutrality in the exclusive neighborhood of Bel-Air outside a USC Shoah Foundation fundraiser to be attended by President Barack Obama on May 7, 2014 in Los Angeles, California.
 Advocates on both sides of the net neutrality debate are calling out Google for apparent hypocrisy this week after it blocked YouTube from working on Amazon's FireTV product.
 People who watch a lot of YouTube videos through their Amazon streaming devices got a nasty surprise Tuesday when YouTube announced it would cut its video service from the FireTV by Jan. 1 due to a ""lack of reciprocity"" from the retail company. Amazon doesn't sell most of Google's hardware products and doesn't make its Prime Video service available on Google's Chromecast.
Meanwhile, Google, Amazon, and tens of thousands of other tech companies have stood up against the Federal Communication Commission's plans to repeal net neutrality protections, arguing that rolling back Obama-era rules could allow internet service providers to start blocking content or slowing down data from certain sites. 
 Advocates on the side of the ISPs say that YouTube's latest move proves that these companies aren't as dedicated to a ""free and open internet"" as they say. 
""The whole point of net neutrality was supposed to be that the consumer could get what they want how they want on the internet,"" says Scott Cleland, a chairman of NetCompetition, a forum supported by ISPs.""That's why this is so hypocritical.""
John Spalter, of the trade association USTelecom, echoes the sentiment:
 ""Broadband ISPs are committed to providing an open internet for their customers, including protections like no content blocking or throttling. Seems like some of the biggest internet companies can't say the same. Ironic, isn't it?""
People on Twitter are calling foul, too, highlighting how the move shows that the tech giants are infringing on the ethos that they're apparently fighting to protect:

 With this latest announcement, Google is essentially blocking some users from using what is usually a free and open website. 
""It looks like Google is putting corporate interests ahead of openness, and the interests of consumers,"" says John Bergmayer, of PublicKnowledge. The organization also criticizes Amazon's refusal to put its video service on Google devices. 
Today, people are protesting net neutrality repeal at hundreds of Verizon stores across the country, and Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future, which supports the protests, says this latest spat between Amazon and Google highlights that the net neutrality fight shouldn't be about ""what the biggest names in Silicon Valley"" think, but defending small businesses, startups, and regular internet users. 
""This is exactly why we need net neutrality,"" she says.
Neither Amazon nor Google returned request for comment. The FCC is expected to vote on rescinding net neutrality rules on December 14.

 The investment would earn the Chinese e-commerce giant a 25 percent stake in Bigbasket and a foothold in two burgeoning e-commerce markets: the nascent Indian e-commerce industry and the online grocery industry.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said earlier this year the company would invest $3 billion in India to challenge local names like Flipkart and Snapdeal, but the American titan has been increasingly facing off against its Chinese rival in the country. 
 Bigbasket had previously been in investment talks with Amazon, Bloomberg reports, before the online retailer's purchase of Whole Foods in June.

 Major Whole Foods supplier sees unexpected sales bump after Amazon takeover   
 6:34  PM ET Fri,  8 Dec 2017 |  00:47 
 United Natural Foods, a major Whole Foods supplier, revised its full-year revenue guidance after seeing record sales and an unexpected surge in demand last quarter — another sign that Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition is leading to increased sales at the grocery chain.
 During the earnings call on Thursday, United Natural Foods CEO Steve Spinner said the company struggled to keep up with the unexpected increase in demand, causing the company to adjust its operation ""in real time,"" as opposed to being prepared months in advance.
""Our ability to respond and execute at a high-service and low-cost manner was challenged during the quarter,"" Spinner said.
 Although he said the demand came from across all customer channels, Whole Foods likely drove the lion's share of the increase, as United Natural Foods gets about a third of its sales from the grocery chain. Those out-of-stock items meant United Natural Foods incurred a loss of $25 million that it otherwise would not have, he said. (The company showed a total quarterly profit of $30 million.)
For the quarter, United Natural Foods had record quarterly sales of $2.4 billion and raised its full-year revenue guidance to the range of $9.84 billion to $10 billion. United Natural Foods stock is up over 2 percent as of Friday afternoon.
This is the latest indicator suggesting Amazon's impact on Whole Foods' business growth. Last month, Whole Foods disclosed that its sales increased 4.4 percent year over year, the highest jump since the third quarter of 2015.
Amazon has made a number of changes at Whole Foods since buying the grocery chain in June for $13 billion. It cut prices across the board and started selling thousands of Whole Foods products on Amazon.com. It also sells Amazon devices in-store and is expected to roll out special discounts for Amazon Prime members as well.

 Economists tend to characterize the scope of regulation as a simple matter of expanding or contracting state power. But a political economy perspective emphasizes that social relations abhor a power vacuum. When state authority contracts, private parties fill the gap. That power can feel just as oppressive, and have effects just as pervasive, as garden variety administrative agency enforcement of civil law. As Robert Lee Hale stated, ""There is government whenever one person or group can tell others what they must do and when those others have to obey or suffer a penalty.""
We are familiar with that power in employer-employee relationships, or when a massive firm extracts concessions from suppliers. But what about when a firm presumes to exercise juridical power, not as a party to a conflict, but the authority deciding it? I worry that such scenarios will become all the more common as massive digital platforms exercise more power over our commercial lives.
 A few weeks ago, the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (a think tank affiliated with the Social Democratic Party in Germany) invited me to speak at their Conference on Digital Capitalism. As European authorities develop long-term plans to address the rise of powerful platforms, they want to know: What is new, or particularly challenging, in digital capitalism?
My answer focused on the identity and aspirations of major digital firms. They are no longer market participants. Rather, in their fields, they are market makers, able to exert regulatory control over the terms on which others can sell goods and services. Moreover, they aspire to displace more government roles over time, replacing the logic of territorial sovereignty with functional sovereignty. In functional arenas from room-letting to transportation to commerce, persons will be increasingly subject to corporate, rather than democratic, control.
For example: Who needs city housing regulators when Airbnb can use data-driven methods to effectively regulate room-letting, then house-letting, and eventually urban planning generally? Why not let Amazon have its own jurisdiction or charter city, or establish special judicial procedures for Foxconn? Some vanguardists of functional sovereignty believe online rating systems could replace state occupational licensure — so rather than having government boards credential workers, a platform like LinkedIn could collect star ratings on them.
In this and later posts, I want to explain how this shift from territorial to functional sovereignty is creating a new digital political economy.

 Trump asked Cooperman if Amazon was a monopoly   
 5:29  PM ET Thu,  7 Dec 2017 |  01:05 
 Amazon's rise is instructive. As Lina Khan explains, ""the company has positioned itself at the center of e-commerce and now serves as essential infrastructure for a host of other businesses that depend upon it."" The ""everything store"" may seem like just another service in the economy — a virtual mall. But when a firm combines tens of millions of customers with a ""marketing platform, a delivery and logistics network, a payment service, a credit lender, an auction house … a hardware manufacturer, and a leading host of cloud server space,"" as Khan observes, it's not just another shopping option.
Digital political economy helps us understand how platforms accumulate power. With online platforms, it's not a simple narrative of ""best service wins."" Network effects have been on the cyberlaw (and digital economics) agenda for over twenty years. Amazon's dominance has exhibited how network effects can be self-reinforcing. The more merchants there are selling on (or to) Amazon, the better shoppers can be assured that they are searching all possible vendors. The more shoppers there are, the more vendors consider Amazon a ""must-have"" venue. As crowds build on either side of the platform, the middleman becomes ever more indispensable. Oh, sure, a new platform can enter the market—but until it gets access to the 480 million items Amazon sells (often at deep discounts), why should the median consumer defect to it? If I want garbage bags, do I really want to go over to Target.com to re-enter all my credit card details, create a new log-in, read the small print about shipping, and hope that this retailer can negotiate a better deal with Glad? Or do I, ala Sunstein, want a predictive shopping purveyor that intimately knows my past purchase habits, with satisfaction just a click away?
As artificial intelligence improves, the tracking of shopping into the Amazon groove will tend to become ever more rational for both buyers and sellers. Like a path through a forest trod ever clearer of debris, it becomes the natural default.
To examine just one of many centripetal forces sucking money, data, and commerce into online behemoths, play out game theoretically how the possibility of online conflict redounds in Amazon's favor. If you have a problem with a merchant online, do you want to pursue it as a one-off buyer? Or as someone whose reputation has been established over dozens or hundreds of transactions—and someone who can credibly threaten to deny Amazon hundreds or thousands of dollars of revenue each year?
The same goes for merchants: The more tribute they can pay to Amazon, the more likely they are to achieve visibility in search results and attention (and perhaps even favor) when disputes come up. What Bruce Schneier said about security is increasingly true of commerce online: You want to be in the good graces of one of the neo-feudal giants who bring order to a lawless realm. Yet few hesitate to think about exactly how the digital lords might use their data advantages against those they ostensibly protect.
 ""The more online buyers and sellers are relying on Amazon to do their bidding or settle their disputes, the less power they have relative to Amazon itself.""
-Frank Pasquale, Law professor, University of Maryland
 Forward-thinking legal thinkers are helping us grasp these dynamics. For example, Rory van Loo has described the status of the ""corporation as courthouse""—that is, when platforms like Amazon run dispute resolution schemes to settle conflicts between buyers and sellers. Van Loo describes both the efficiency gains that an Amazon settlement process might have over small claims court, and the potential pitfalls for consumers (such as opaque standards for deciding cases). I believe that, on top of such economic considerations, we may want to consider the political economic origins of e-commerce feudalism. For example, as consumer rights shrivel, it's rational for buyers to turn to Amazon (rather than overwhelmed small claims courts) to press their case. The evisceration of class actions, the rise of arbitration, boilerplate contracts—all these make the judicial system an increasingly vestigial organ in consumer disputes. Individuals rationally turn to online giants for powers to impose order that libertarian legal doctrine stripped from the state. And in so doing, they reinforce the very dynamics that led to the state's etiolation in the first place.
This weakness has become something of a joke with Amazon's recent decision to incite a bidding war for its second headquarters. Mayors have abjectly begged Amazon to locate jobs in their jurisdictions. As readers of Richard Thaler's ""The Winner's Curse"" might have predicted, the competitive dynamics have tempted far too many to offer far too much in the way of incentives. As journalist Danny Westneat recently confirmed:
 Chicago has offered to let Amazon pocket $1.32 billion in income taxes paid by its own workers. Fresno has a novel plan to give Amazon special authority over how the company's taxes are spent. Boston has offered to set up an ""Amazon Task Force"" of city employees working on the company's behalf. Stonecrest,  Georgia even offered to cannibalize itself, to give Bezos the chance to become mayor of a 345 acre annex that would be known as ""Amazon, Georgia.""  
Note that these maneuvers–what Tracey Kaye calls ""corporate seduction"" via tax and other incentives–are not new. But as they accelerate, they mark a faster transfer of power from state to corporate actors. The mayors are in a weakened position because their tax revenues are not high enough to support high quality municipal services, and now they're succoring a corporate actor with a long history of fighting to push taxation even lower. Similarly, the more online buyers and sellers are relying on Amazon to do their bidding or settle their disputes, the less power they have relative to Amazon itself. They are less like arms-length transactors with the company, than they are like subjects of a despot, whose many roles include consumer and anti-fraud protection.
Even the federal government may soon privatize critical procurement functions, relying on Amazon's giantism to extract deals that the Defense Department is itself unable to demand. Procurement premised on public purpose could contribute to a Green New Deal. When it is, instead, premised merely on the cheapest cost, it's an open invitation to continue the same unethical sourcing that has plagued so much government purchasing.
Solutions to Amazon's power will, no doubt, be hard to advance as a political matter — consumers like 2-day deliveries. But understanding the bigger picture here is a first step. Political economy clarifies the stakes of Amazon's increasing power over commerce. We are not simply addressing dyadic transactions of individual consumers and merchants. Data access asymmetries will disadvantage each of them (and advantage Amazon as the middleman) for years to come. Nor can we consider that power imbalance in isolation from the way Amazon pits cities against one another. Mastery of political dynamics is just as important to the firm's success as any technical or business acumen. And only political organization can stop its functional sovereignties from further undermining the territorial governance at the heart of democracy.

 Amazon has sharply curtailed hiring in Seattle as it seeks second headquarters   
 5:55  PM ET Mon, 11 Dec 2017 |  00:48 
 Amazon has significantly cut the number of open positions in Seattle, and some employees are talking about a hiring freeze, according to the Seattle Times and two employees who spoke to CNBC.
 As of last week, Amazon had 3,503 open positions in Seattle, just a fraction of the over 9,000 job openings it had in June and the lowest since 2014, the report said. That would also make the August to November period the slowest hiring four-month period for Amazon in King County, it said.
On top of that, several employees told the Seattle Times about hiring freezes or postponements in their groups, the first sign of a slowdown in Amazon's rapid expansion over the past few years.

 Amazon's plans to expand booze delivery causes buzz among brewers

 Separately, two current Amazon employees told CNBC they had heard no new positions will be added in the Seattle area until early next year. The company has previously said it expects to announce the winning city for its second headquarters in 2018. One of these people said their manager shared the news, the other characterized it as a widespread rumor in the company.
The change in Amazon hiring plan comes as the e-commerce giant seeks the location of its second headquarters. Amazon has drawn 238 bids from 54 different regions across North America for the second headquarters, which the company said will get over $5 billion in investment and employ over 50,000 people.
It's unclear what exactly is driving the cutback. But Amazon told the Seattle Times there's no company-wide mandate for a hiring freeze. An Amazon representative told CNBC that the company normally sees seasonal fluctuations in job openings and that it will continue to hire across the company.
""Amazon employs over 500,000 people worldwide, and we're continuing to hire for thousands of open jobs across the company. We are constantly evaluating hiring needs to ensure we're dedicating resources efficiently and effectively, so it's common for there to be fluctuations in headcount as we grow at different rates across businesses,"" Amazon said in a statement.

Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.
 Amazon expanded its cloud footprint in China Tuesday in one of the fastest-growing but most competitive markets in the world. 
 The U.S. e-commerce giant said it partnered with Ningxia Western Cloud Data Technology Co (NWCD) to open its second Amazon Web Services (AWS) operating region in China. AWS is Amazon's cloud computing arm.
Amazon will now have cloud services available to customers in the Ningxia region, which is south west of Beijing. 
 The Seattle, WA-based firm already has a cloud footprint in Beijing thanks to its partnership with Sinnet.
It's difficult for American firms to enter China without a partnership. Through the relationships with these Chinese firms, Amazon is able to get its cloud products into China. NWCD offers AWS products to Chinese customers on behalf of Amazon. 
Operating in China is not always easy, particularly for companies handling customer data. Last month, Amazon sold parts of its cloud business in China for up to 2 billion Chinese yuan ($301 million) to its partner Sinnet. In a statement at the time, Amazon said it sold ""certain physical infrastructure assets"" to ""comply with Chinese law.""

 China is a tough but potentially lucrative market for foreign cloud players. In the cloud services market, where Amazon is a player, Chinese operators account for around 80 percent of revenues, according to market research firm Synergy Research. But at the same time, public cloud spending in China grew 55.6 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2017, according to IDC, highlighting the potential of the market. 
Amazon is battling local giants including Alibaba and Tencent. 
""For years, AWS and our partners have had an enthusiastic base of customers in China, a country with one of the world's largest and most dynamic cloud ecosystems,"" Andy Jassy, CEO of AWS, said in a press release on Tuesday. 
Amazon said it has ""thousands of active customers in China already"" such as Lenovo, Samsung Electronics and Xiaomi. 
The company said that the Ningxia launch marks its seventh cloud region in Asia-Pacific.

 Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya: Amazon is a natural product monopoly   
 8:09  AM ET Tue, 12 Dec 2017 |  03:58 
 Amazon is not a monopoly, but its dominance is based on users' love and its ability to listen to customers to decide what to do next, according to Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya. 
 Palihapitiya calls that a ""natural product monopoly.""
""You build something, and when it starts to work what happens is the usage tells you what the trail of breadcrumbs is [that] you should follow,"" the venture capitalist told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday.
 ""So what Amazon has done elegantly is they built a product that has such a fantastic product-market fit, they watch how people use it, then they actually use that to distill what to do next,"" he said. ""And what to do next becomes slightly easier and easier every turn and every time they do it.""
The former Facebook executive told CNBC in March that Amazon could be close to a ""natural monopoly"" in both online retail and cloud computing via its Amazon Web Services division. 
Palihapitiya has been bullish on Amazon for some time. In May, he said the internet retail titan will be worth $3 trillion in 10 years 
.
There have been questions from many corners of the business world and even the Oval Office about whether Amazon is a monopoly.
Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman, who runs the Omega Advisors hedge fund, told CNBC last week that President Donald Trump asked him that very question, twice, during a dinner this summer, weeks before federal regulators signed off on the e-commerce giant's acquisition of Whole Foods Market.
Cooperman said he told Trump that he does not believe Amazon is a monopoly. Amazon has ""out-executed people,"" Cooperman said. ""I think they've done a very good job.""
In Tuesday's CNBC interview, Palihapitiya also praised the pace of Amazon's innovations, citing the ""tens"" of products that were released at the company's annual re:Invent conference. 
""When you take a step back and say, wait a minute, the totality of what they did is unbelievable — and then you think they did that in a year, and then they did that at a velocity that you could imagine, at a scale, at an impact — then you think to yourself well what is next year going to look like?"" Palihapitiya said. 
At re:Invent, Amazon launched a number of cloud products that run on AWS that ""likely hurt start-ups trying to do similar things, and also the venture capitalists that back them,""  Palihapitiya said.
""The things that [Amazon] did probably wiped out about $2 billion of equity value of VCs putting money into ideas that frankly made no sense in the first place,"" he said.

 });Starting a company out of your garage sounds exciting — invoking visions of Silicon Valley greats Hewlett Packard and Apple, and Jeff Bezos starting Amazon in his Seattle garage circa 1994.
 That is, until you actually start a company in your garage.
So says Chieh Huang. He knows this from experience. He launched Boxed from his parents' garage. He got long, unsatisfied glances from his mother-in-law.
 ""Everyone wants to start a business in their garage — they think it's sexy — but when you actually sit as a 30-year-old in a garage — it's not so sexy,"" Huang tells CNBC Make It. ""My mother-in-law was like, 'I told you he's not the one!'...
""[T]hose are tough times ... but really powering through that has become a life-changing moment for me and our co-founders and for a lot of folks that work at the company.""

Boxed started in CEO Chieh Huang's parents' garage.
 Huang, now 36, launched online warehouse club Boxed in the 2013 out of his parents' two-car garage in suburban New Jersey — ""the cradle of civilization,"" jokes Huang. (Previously, Huang held stints at the law firm Proskauer Rose and Zynga and launched co-founded his own gaming company, Astro Ape.) Boxed ships bulk, things like seltzer, Oreos and toilet paper, to individuals' homes and small and large businesses.
Growth has been unbelievably quick.
""So we did about $40,000 of revenue in 2013, high-fiving each other in the garage, and from there on out, less than 36 months later in 2016, we actually cleared over nine figures — or over $100,000,000 — in revenue,"" says Huang. ""It's been a really wild kind of roller coaster ride and we've learned a ton since the days in the garage."" 
 ""Everyone wants to start a business in their garage — they think it's sexy — but when you actually sit as a 30-year-old in a garage — it's not so sexy.""
-Chieh Huang, CEO of Boxed
 Currently, the New York City-headquartered company has about 400 employees all over the United States and has raised $160 million in venture capital funding. 
And yet, even as Huang is having the ride of his life, Boxed is playing in competitive territory: It is, after all, an e-commerce company in the era of Amazon's near-total domination. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos has recently overtaken Microsoft founder Bill Gates as the richest person in the world and he was even briefly worth $100 billion thanks to a surge in Amazon's stock price after Black Friday, according to data from Forbes. Currently, Bezos' net worth is north of $98 billion.

Chieh Huang
 ""Yeah, I would say [Bezos is] in my dreams often, but you couldn't be any entrepreneur nowadays — you can't help but think about what Amazon is doing in your industry,"" says Huang. ""And so for us, of course we think about Amazon. Of course, we think about Walmart, Target, Costco, Sam's Club. We think about everyone."" 
So far however, Boxed is surviving the Bezos era. ""Luckily, the business that we've built, I would say, has a few natural moats,"" says Huang. ""Really, there's no other private company doing what we're doing.
""So we have seen our position become the eye of the storm that is swirling around retail,"" he says, referring to Boxed's enviable position amid a retail industry that's at times hemorrhaging jobs and is experiencing bankruptcy filings and store closings at a record pace. 
Here's why Huang says he has been so successful in such a short period of time.
 Boxed is focused
 Boxed is relentlessly focused — it does not try to sell everything like Amazon. Rather, Boxed only sells large, warehouse-sized packages of goods.
""We really have built that 'stock up and save' platform where folks come solely [for that],"" says Huang.
""As a business owner, you want to be naturally everything to everyone so you can build a really big business. But we have found it is probably better for us, and a better way to build a big business, if we are really disciplined. ... [W]e're not 'The Everything Store.""
The strategy allows Boxed to concentrate buying power on just a limited inventory, so Huang has leverage with suppliers to get competitive prices. Boxed can then turn around and sell goods at low prices to its customers.

 Boxed is high-tech
 The basic nature of the goods that Boxed sells (dish soap, granola bars, diapers) belies the technical sophistication of the company. The fulfillment center depends heavily on robotics to keep costs down and for business customers, Boxed uses predictive analytics to advance ship whatever goods Boxed has calculated the customer is likely to need. 
It's ""one of the most advanced consumer packaged goods fulfillment centers in the world for [business to consumer] deliveries,"" says Huang.

 Employees are treated well — really well
 Just because a company embraces robots does not mean that employees have to lose their jobs. Boxed is a case in point. ""On its surface, I 100 percent agree it seems like it's a little bit contradictory"" to both widely implement robots and take care of employees respectfully, Huang admits.
""So, we struggled with it.... But we stuck true to our roots and so we told everyone in these fulfillment centers, you're not going to lose your job solely because of automation — in fact we're going to train you on how to interact, how to troubleshoot and how to work with state-of-the-art software and state-of-the-art robotics.""  
 ""Twelve times out of 10 we're going to do the right thing for the employees of the company — it's a fundamental belief.""
-Chieh Huang, CEO of Boxed

Boxed employee Weslee Berke, who married David Podgor, benefited from the company's policy of paying for life-changing events.
 Boxed also offers unique perks: Chieh personally pays for employees' children's college tuition (with no limit on cost) and the company pays for life-changing events like weddings up to $20,000, depending on how long the employee has been with the company.
Taking care of employees like Boxed does is not cheap.

Huang himself personally paid for employee Joe Bobko's son's college tuition.
 ""[T]his may seem pretty crazy ... you can't say what line of benefit do you really get for doing all these things, but it shows up elsewhere in terms of increased morale,"" for one, says Huang. 
Thinking long-term about employees is the right way to operate, says Huang. ""[W]e get investors that have pushed against the systems, but what I tell them is that as long as I'm at the helm and our management team is at the helm, 12 times out of 10 we're going to do the right thing for the employees of the company — it's a fundamental belief."" 
 Embed tweet Huang do the right thing
 Boxed runs lean
 Even though Boxed is generous with employees, the young company doesn't splurge on unnecessary luxuries. ""We're a very frugal company,"" says Huang.
The margins selling toilet paper in bulk are thin, but also, Huang was raised in a self-described working class family — his mother supported a family of four with a minimum-wage job at a fast-food Chinese restaurant — and so he has built a company that reflects the spending habits he became comfortable with growing up.
""We have really interesting policies, which I have to adhere to myself. So I'm fresh off of a four-country trip over 36 hours across the world, where I flew economy on each leg,"" says Huang. He left New York, flew to Dubai, Dubai to Germany, Germany to London and London to New York in under two days.
""And so it's the reason why I may not be as good looking as I should be, but the what would be an example of a policy where we are frugal,"" says the CEO, laughing.
""There's policies like that that we need to stick to because they're the same policies when we were in a garage, and now that we're big doesn't mean that you know we deserve the luxuries of being a bigger company.""

 Druckenmiller: I love Amazon   
 12:56  PM ET Wed, 13 Dec 2017 |  06:24 
 Amazon's stock is up big this year, but hedge-fund legend Stanley Druckenmiller thinks the e-commerce giant's shares have more room to run.
 ""I love Amazon. This company, which everybody keeps quoting the multiple, is selling for less than three times sales. The S&P 500 is selling for over two times sales,"" Druckenmiller, the chairman and CEO of the Duquesne Family Office, told CNBC's Kelly Evans on ""Closing Bell"" on Tuesday.
Amazon shares have skyrocketed higher by more than 55 percent this year, but the sharp increase has elevated the stock's price-to-earnings multiple, a metric used to value stocks. According to FactSet, Amazon was trading at a multiple of 296. By comparison, the S&P 500 was trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 22.
 But Druckenmiller said the e-commerce giant is ""intentionally underearning,"" noting Amazon is reinvesting capital back into its businesses instead. Druckenmiller also praised Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, saying ""I think Bezos is incredible."" 
Druckenmiller also praised Tencent, a Chinese technology company.
""I really like Tencent, and I really like their position. They're in payments, they've got their own version of Netflix, they've got their own version of cloud, WeChat is probably the best platform on the entire planet for all of it, and then they have a gaming business,"" Druckenmiller said. And like Amazon, ""Tencent is intentionally underearning, and the long-term growth looks incredible.""
Tencent's Hong Kong-listed shares have more than doubled this year, rising 104 percent.  Druckenmiller said he owns Tencent shares.
 However, there is one tech giant Druckenmiller is not wild about: Apple. During the interview, he said: ""I don't find [it] nearly as exciting as say, Amazon, Facebook or Google.""
He said Apple's products are great, ""but they're probably no better than Samsung's.""
On the smartphone maker, he added, ""I just don't see the underearning that I see in these other companies.""
The investor said he does not own Apple or have a short position against the company.
Druckenmiller's hedge fund generated annualized returns of 30 percent during his investment career. The investor has a net worth of $4.7 billion, according to Forbes.

 Disney deal with Fox would be a 'home run' in its battle against Netflix   
 12:29  PM ET Wed, 13 Dec 2017 |  00:48 
 The strategic rationale for Disney buying key media content assets from Twenty-First Century Fox to compete with Netflix is sound, according to one Wall Street firm.
 On Tuesday, CNBC eported that Twenty-First Century Fox and Disney are on a ""glide path"" for a Thursday deal announcement for Fox's movie and television assets. ""With media reports indicating that the Disney/Fox deal looks to have the green light and likely gets announced tomorrow, all eyes will be on Iger & Co. going forward to see what direction Disney strategically takes this 'game changing' $60 billion+ media deal,"" Daniel Ives, GBH Insights' head of technology research, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ""We view this as a home run deal for Disney and while its [sic] an aggressive acquisition with a high price tag, in our opinion this is the right move at the right time as the marriage of these assets creates a much more formidable Disney on both the content and streaming front for the coming years.""
Ives estimates Disney will have a dominant 35 percent to 40 percent market share of U.S. movie box office sales after the deal. He projects the company will be able to save about $2 billion in costs during the first 12 to 18 months after the acquisition.
 Disney will also be in a better position to compete with internet giants with the new assets, according to the analyst. The company announced plans in August to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018.
""We continue to strongly believe the core underlying driver for this deal in our opinion is the impending battle royale for content and streaming services vs. the Netflix machine,"" Ives wrote. ""Disney with this Fox acquisition in its back pocket would create a fiercer landscape for content and thus put itself in a much healthier position to gain market and mind share vs. the likes of technology stalwarts such as Netflix and Amazon when it officially launches in 2019.""
Disney shares are underperforming the market this year. Its shares have rallied 3 percent through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 19 percent gain.

I love the oak shell that was sent with my demo unit
 The Amazon Echo now allows users play Spotify and SiriusXM on different Echos around their homes.
 Amazon rolled out the multi-room music feature earlier this year, which lets users play the same song on different Echo units placed around their homes. That feature was limited to Amazon Music Unlimited, TuneIn, iHeartRadio and Pandora, however. Which means it wasn't as capable as the Google Home or Sonos speakers for folks who subscribe to Spotify.
Users will simply need to say, ""Alexa, play music everywhere"" to play music from the default service they've selected. They can also ask Alexa to play music on select Echo units in specific rooms, like the dining room and living room, for example.
 Amazon said the feature is limited to select countries, however, including the United States, UK, Cananda, Germany and Ireland. SiriusXM multi-room support only works in the US.

 Apple could fall behind Amazon and Google in the ""post-smartphone era"" due to ""innovation complacency,"" a market research firm said Wednesday.
 ABI Research defines the post-smartphone world as one where new, hands-free interfaces — such as those that use the human voice — need to be developed. This will include more artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality, and virtual reality.
The research company made an assessment of patent portfolios, research and development spend, acquisitions and contributions to open source communities to evaluate and compare 10 major technology players from Facebook to Microsoft and Samsung. 
 It concluded that Amazon and Google will ""lead and drive innovation around smartphones and related ecosystems"" in the next six years.
""This next wave of innovation in the smart device ecosystem will be led by Google and Amazon, as their apparent strength in major growth sectors, notably computer science, allows for a more flexible approach to next-generation user experiences that are essential for creating immersive experiences and brand-new ways of human-to-machine interactions,"" David McQueen, research director at ABI Research, said in a press release.

 Amazon Alexa VP: Echo calling feature is revolutionizing communication   
 11:12  AM ET Fri, 20 Oct 2017 |  03:25 
 ABI's report said Apple will ""lag due to innovation complacency.""
Apple was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC. 
McQueen explained that established device makers like Apple, Samsung and Microsoft will be ""followers"" in the new market and are ""not currently as well set up to drive future innovation,"" mainly due to their legacy hardware businesses. But they should not be dismissed because they have a ""major influence on the market"" through brand and market share. 
All of the major technology players are trying to release new products beyond the smartphone, with many focusing on smart digital assistants. Amazon has its Echo smart speaker with the AI voice assistant Alexa built in. The U.S. e-commerce giant has been releasing several different versions of the Echo and has also been integrating Alexa with other products from device makers. 
Meanwhile, Google has brought out a rival product called Google Home with its own smart assistant. And Apple is gearing up to launch its competitor to the Echo called the HomePod, with its voice assistant Siri built in. Samsung has also been trying to push its own digital assistant called Bixby on its new Galaxy S8 and Note 8 smartphones. CNBC also reported in August that Samsung is set to launch its own smart speaker next year. 
Voice assistants appear to be the next big battleground as technology companies look to offer new experiences and ways to interact with devices beyond the touchscreens on smartphones. But winning the market could require a lot of money.
""There will be a requirement for significant investment in the underpinning technologies and technical expertise as well as the creation of 'intelligent phones' that are able to effectively leverage these forthcoming technologies,"" ABI Research said.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at a company conference in London in November 2014.
 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Wednesday said he wished that the company had gotten into the public cloud business earlier.
 Nadella, who ran Microsoft's cloud and enterprise business before becoming its CEO in 2014, made the admission to Marty Chavez, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, during a conversation streamed live from the bank's Facebook page.
Microsoft launched its first Azure service in 2008, two years after Amazon introduced its core cloud computing and storage resources. Today, Amazon Web Services holds nearly 32 percent of the public cloud infrastructure services market, while Microsoft has about 14 percent, according to Canalys.
 Over the years, Microsoft had built up a major server software business — which it stored on companies' premises, Nadella said. Then came AWS — which forced Microsoft to rethink its whole business model.
""We knew by looking at what Amazon was doing that we needed to reinvent ourselves, and by the way, the margins were going to be very, very different -- tough challenge,"" Nadella said, in response to a question from Chavez about disruption and internal innovation.
Nadella said Microsoft cofounder and former CEO Bill Gates had even encouraged him to rethink the server business.
It's important for a business to be able to recognize and move in response to the emergence of a new business model, Nadella said.
""In our case, we did,"" he said. ""I mean, I wish we had started even earlier ... like always. ... Even if you don't disrupt yourself, you've got to be great at responding to these shifts in business models.""
Also in the interview, Chavez asked Nadella who he most looks up to in the technology industry, other than Gates and Nadella's direct predecessor, Steve Ballmer. Again, Nadella referred to Amazon.
""I would say clearly what Jeff Bezos has done at Amazon ... is probably one of the amazing stories of the recent past,"" Nadella said. ""But I'm a great admirer of anyone who creates new categories but are not overnight successes -- but who have gone through this period of 10, 15 years where people are saying, 'What is this business all about?' but have been able to turn and sort of say, 'Well, this is something that is an enduring hit.'""

 Fox will need to acquire a studio after Disney deal: David Faber   
 9:32  AM ET Thu, 14 Dec 2017 |  04:13 
 Disney's strategy of buying key media content assets from Twenty-First Century Fox to beef up content for its own streaming services will not work, according to one Wall Street firm.
 On Thursday, Disney announced a deal to acquire certain Twenty-First Century Fox assets including movie studios and cable entertainment properties. 
""We are weighing in - negatively - with our assessment of what we expect will be the strategic rationale for the deal (positioning Disney better to compete in the OTT space) … In our view, Disney is committing significant capital to the lost cause of protecting video aggregation margins,"" analyst Doug Creutz wrote in a note to clients Thursday. ""Taking on competitors who don't need to turn a profit is rarely a good idea.""
 The analyst reaffirmed his market perform rating and $94 price target for Disney shares, representing 13 percent downside to Wednesday's close.
Disney announced plans in August to launch a branded direct-to-consumer streaming service in 2019 and an ESPN streaming service in 2018.
Creutz said the internet giants like Amazon and Netflix can leverage ""essentially unlimited balance sheets"" to buy content.
""What we don't understand is why Disney would want to compete with Netflix, and other new media players, as a new media content aggregator,"" he wrote. ""With even more players entering the fray (Apple, Google), and a likely willingness by at least some of them to play a long game of loss leadership in content aggregation to support other business objectives, we expect pressure on content margins.""
Disney shares are underperforming the market this year. Its shares have rallied 3 percent through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's 19 percent gain.
""We think that this deal is an attempt by the Murdoch clan to eventually put themselves in position to run Disney,"" he wrote. ""Eventual control of Disney by the Murdochs may not be the most likely outcome, but we think it is a very possible one.""

 Sears lands another deal with Amazon - this time for car batteries, tires   
 12:39  PM ET Thu, 14 Dec 2017 |  00:50 
 Sears Holdings is expanding on its partnership with Amazon and will now sell items from its DieHard brand on the internet giant's website.
 The retailer, which owns Sears and Kmart along with appliance brand Kenmore, has increasingly been searching for ways to diversify the company's revenue stream, as fewer customers shop its department stores.
Sears shares were climbing a little more than 1 percent Thursday morning on the news.
 In July, the company announced it landed its first deal to sell appliances on Amazon.com and debuted a new ""Kenmore Smart"" skill for Amazon's Alexa, which would allow customers to control their appliances by voice commands.
""Launching on Amazon.com will significantly expand the distribution and availability of the DieHard brand in the U.S., building on the success of our recent Kenmore appliances launch on Amazon.com,"" Tom Park, the president of Sears' Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard brands, said in a statement Thursday.
In an interview in July, Park explained to CNBC: ""The Amazon platform is so broad and also focuses on the millennial generation,"" which Sears wants to reach.
Starting Thursday, Sears' customers will find battery-related accessories such as jump starters, maintainers and chargers on Amazon.com, the company said.
Early next year, Sears will sell DieHard-branded tires and actual automotive batteries on the website. The company has said its DieHard tires are ""one of the leading tire brands"" at the department store chain, which also operates Sears Auto Centers.
Meantime, Sears is beginning to open DieHard Auto Centers, which have already sprouted up in Texas and Michigan. In a bid to return to profitability, the company is selling off many of its larger assets (which it says are underperforming), and rolling out concept stores that sell only mattresses and appliances.
Buying itself more time as sales slump, Sears announced earlier this week the company has extended the terms of a $400 million loan to 2019 and also is planning to secure additional borrowing to cover upcoming pension payments.
Sears is expecting itself to reach positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization next year. The retailer's stock has fallen about 55 percent in 2017.

 3:56  PM ET Thu, 14 Dec 2017 |  00:55 
 Netflix, Amazon and the Democratic Party are among those who vocally decried the FCC's repeal of net neutrality regulations on Thursday.
 Netflix tweeted from the company's official account — usually reserved for lighthearted banter with users and praise of its original content — to say the company ""stands with innovators, large and small, to oppose the misguided FCC order.""
 Netflix tweet
 Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg posted on her account that ""internet providers shouldn't be able to decide what people can see online or charge more for certain websites.""
She said the company is ready to work with Congress to ensure equal access to the internet.
 Chief technology officer at Amazon, Werner Vogels, tweeted that he was ""extremely disappointed"" by the move and that Amazon would ""continue to work with our peers, partners and customers to find ways to ensure an open and fair internet that can continue to drive massive innovation.""
 Werner tweet
 Google, in a statement to CNBC, also vowed to work with partners, saying the company will continue to ""promote strong, enforceable protections."" Here's the full statement:
 We remain committed to the net neutrality policies that enjoy overwhelming public support, have been approved by the courts, and are working well for every part of the internet economy. We will work with other net neutrality supporters large and small to promote strong, enforceable protections. 
Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer at Microsoft, tweeted that an open internet benefits the entire economy.
 Smith tweet
 And Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky called the decision ""wrong"" and said a free and open internet is essential to widespread economic empowerment.
 Chesky tweet
 The Democratic Party also weighed in on the Republican push to deregulate the internet, saying it would be ""fighting back"" against the ""massive blow to our free and open internet.""
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has vowed to sue the FCC over the issue.

 The $16,500 drone for farmers, sold on Amazon   
 6:52  PM ET Thu, 14 Dec 2017 |  00:59 
 AeroVironment's latest product isn't your regular stocking stuffer.
 The $16,500 autonomous drone, available on Amazon starting Thursday, is a product for farmers and others in the agricultural industry, AeroVironment CEO Wahid Nawabi told CNBC.
""What we've done is we've taken drones and software analytics and turned it into an app,"" Nawabi told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Thursday. ""If you can turn on a tablet, push go, the drone and the software does all the rest. It's fully automatic: take off vertically and transition to horizontal flight, come back and land on its own while you're having a cup of coffee.""
 The commercial drone, called the Quantix, comes with a one-year subscription to AeroVironment's decision support software, included in the $16,500 price tag.
The supplemental software allows farmers to monitor their crops in order to detect issues and improve efficiency, according to the company's website.
AeroVironment is a leading manufacturer of defense and commercial drones, electric car solutions and other unmanned systems.
Nawabi took pride in the company's defense solutions, one of which is its 10-year-old Switchblade product, a drone that helps the U.S. military monitor its adversaries and can transform into a missile on command.
But AeroVironment is also a quiet leader in the electric car trend, the CEO said. The company's electric car charging product has forged partnerships with nine of the world's top automakers, he told Cramer.
""This represents a significant, large, multi-billion-dollar opportunity for us globally in the years to come,"" Nawabi said. ""It's small, compact, indoor-outdoor, UL-certified, safe, and we are in the leading position in this market for both residential and commercial applications of electric vehicle charging.""

 Amazon Prime growth is slowing down in the U.S., says Morgan Stanley   
 5:50  PM ET Thu, 14 Dec 2017 |  00:53 
 Amazon Prime growth is plateauing in the U.S., showing the first signs of a slowdown in its oldest market, Morgan Stanley wrote in a note published this week.
 Prime, a paid membership program that gives free two-day shipping and access to other perks such as online video and music, is important for Amazon because Prime members tend to spend more on its e-commerce site. Amazon calls Prime one of the three pillars of its business, alongside the Amazon Marketplace, its site connecting buyers and sellers, and Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing business.
Based on a survey of 1,000 U.S. adults in the third quarter of 2017, Morgan Stanley concluded that 40 percent of American consumers are currently Prime members — the same percentage seen in its survey from the fourth quarter of 2016.
 ""These data are the first evidence of potential Prime penetration limits in Amazon's oldest market,"" Morgan Stanley wrote in the note.
Amazon doesn't disclose the size of Prime or a breakdown of its demographics. Instead, the company shares revenue from ""subscription services,"" which includes Prime in the U.S. and overseas, as well as content subscriptions for things such as e-books and music. In the third quarter, subscription revenue grew 59 percent from a year ago, to $2.4 billion.
The slowdown in the U.S. comes partly because membership to the program is nearing saturation in the higher-income market. Another survey by Piper Jaffray in June said that 82 percent of U.S. households with over $112,000 in income are already Prime members.
Morgan Stanley said this means it's important for Amazon to expand Prime to the lower-income and older households — both segments that have historically had lower Prime penetration rates. To go after the lower-income market, Amazon has recently launched monthly payment plans and special discounts for people receiving government assistance. As Amazon increases its offerings related to health care, that would help it target older consumers, the note said.

 Most people across the country are supportive of their region winning Amazon's HQ2. More than half (55 percent) say this would ""definitely"" be a good thing for their area, while 38 percent say ""possibly"" and just 5 percent say ""definitely not.""
But certain areas are more enthusiastic than others. We grouped respondents into ""combined statistical areas,"" which are geographic units defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget that combine metropolitan areas with surrounding areas that have commuting and economic ties to the more populous region. This type of analysis allows us to account for the fact that the arrival of Amazon HQ2 would impact not just the immediate city but the surrounding region as well, and it gives us a large enough sample size to do a nationwide analysis.

 If Jeff Bezos wants to ensure he will have enough of a workforce to start Amazon's second headquarters, Detroit and Atlanta are the obvious places to start. In the Detroit area, 28 percent of people said they would ""definitely"" want to work for Amazon if the company brought its second headquarters to town.
In the Atlanta region, 26 percent of people said they would definitely want to work for Amazon, as did 24 percent of those in the Houston region, 23 percent of those in the Miami region and 23 percent of those in greater Los Angeles.

 Amazon has projected the creation of  50,000 new jobs in whatever city or region it ultimately chooses. The most recent jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics puts unemployment in Detroit and Atlanta at 4.2 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively, as of October — roughly in the middle of the pack.
 Good thing for your area
 Amazon's considerations go well beyond hiring. The internet giant has reshaped the city of Seattle in its own image, attracting tech employees from around the world, driving up housing prices and compelling the city to invest more heavily in transit options and infrastructure.
The same would likely occur in whichever city hosts its second headquarters, which would be a boon for many cities. Aside from their own desire to work for Amazon, residents of the Detroit area were again the most enthusiastic about HQ2 coming to town in terms of their expectations for its impact on the region. More than 3 in 4 people living in Detroit and the surrounding region said that Amazon would be a ""good thing"" for their area — the highest of any region with at least 150 respondents reporting in our survey.

 Overall, more people want Amazon to come to their area than actually want to work for Amazon. Though Detroit is by far the most enthusiastic, large proportions of a number of cities say that Amazon would be a good thing for their respective areas, including Boston (61 percent), Dallas (60 percent), Minneapolis (58 percent) and Atlanta (58 percent).
Nationally, 55 percent of people would want Amazon to locate its second headquarters near them, though just 18 percent say they would want to work at HQ2.
 Less enthusiasm in ...
 If Amazon takes public opinion into account in making its decision, Denver and the San Francisco/San Jose area could quickly be eliminated. Just 11 percent of Denver area residents and 10 percent of Bay Area residents said they would definitely want to work for Amazon, by far the lowest of all areas surveyed.
Similarly, 17 percent of Denver area residents and 14 percent of those in the Bay Area said that HQ2 would ""definitely not"" be a good thing for their area, by far the highest of any region surveyed. Nationally, just 5 percent of people said the same.
In the months since the competition was announced, various outlets have used Amazon's own requirements to model which cities best meet the qualifications for the company's second headquarters. Analyses conducted by CNBC show that big cities like New York meet many of the requirements laid out by Amazon in its request for proposals, but southern metro areas — including Charlotte/Raleigh-Durham/Greensboro-High Point, North Carolina — could make a compelling case. The New York Times Upshot blog  predicted that Denver would win out. But Denver residents themselves don't want Amazon, and many other areas — especially Detroit — do.

A worker moves a bin filled with products inside of an Amazon fulfillment centre in Robbinsville, New Jersey, November 27, 2017.
 The importance of online retail and Amazon's dominion over e-commerce have no end in sight, according to J.P. Morgan.
 Citing Amazon's growing market share and the success of Amazon Web Services, analyst Doug Anmuth argued that Jeff Bezos' retail giant is only just getting started.
""We believe Amazon is well positioned as the market leader in e-commerce, where it's still early days with U.S. e-commerce representing about 12 percent of adjusted retail sales (ex-gas, food, and autos), which we view as likely going to 30 percent over time,"" Anmuth wrote Monday. ""We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall e-commerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party vs. third-party inventory and its Prime offering both serve as major advantages.""
 As one of Main Street's largest disruptors, Amazon roared through 2017 by keeping pressure on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, sending entire industry groups tumbling after it acquired Whole Foods Market over the summer. Though countless companies have shed share value, Amazon's stock has climbed more than 58 percent since January, one of the best large-cap performances this year.
Anmuth's new $1,375 price target on Amazon shares is 17 percent higher than Friday's closing price. Shares closed up 1 percent Monday.
Though it is known for pairing consumer goods with logistical prowess, Amazon has seen significant growth in its cloud platform, known as Amazon Web Services. As a secure cloud services platform, AWS offers its users computing power, data storage and content delivery to help scale businesses, according to its website.
""We believe AWS is the leader in the public cloud with roughly 75 percent U.S. market share, and it remains early with only about 10 percent or more of workloads in the cloud today and the pace of cloud adoption accelerating in our view,"" explained Anmuth. While the analyst offered positive outlook on Amazon, he also remarked on social media companies Twitter and Facebook and on Priceline.
Calling Twitter one of J.P. Morgan's best ideas in 2018, Anmuth upgraded shares and raised his price target on the popular platform to $27 from $20, implying 21 percent upside over the next 12 months. After an unimpressive start to the year, Twitter staged a 43 percent climb in the past six months — a trend the analyst believes will continue with daily active user growth and scaling ad revenue.
And Anmuth's $225 price target on Facebook reflects his belief in 25 percent upside for the stock in the next year.
The analyst is also bullish on online travel agent Priceline, increasing his price target to $2,050, which is 16 percent higher than Friday's close. His old price target was $1,950.
""We continue to think Priceline is the best in class in online travel with strong growth driven by scale benefits, efficient performance & brand spend, and large and growing supply,"" explained Anmuth. ""We also believe Priceline has the potential to re-accelerate in mid-2018 as comps ease and stepped-up investments start to reap benefits.""

 });The Amazon Echo Spot, which launches on Tuesday, is now my favorite Echo.That's a tall order, since I'm fond of the new Echo and Echo Show. But, with its miniature display, camera and the same smarts as every other Echo, it's perfect for any room and especially convenient for travel.At $129, it's also priced well below the $230 Echo Show — the only other such device with a display.It isn't perfect, but it's darn near close.Here's what you need to know.The Echo Spot reminds me of a grapefruit or a Magic 8 Ball sliced in half, with a 2.5-inch touchscreen display that shows, by default, a clock. It's meant to sit next to your bed, in your kitchen, or in other rooms where you might not already have a larger-sized Echo product.Given its size, I've found it not only works well in my bedroom or on my desk without taking up too much space, it would also be perfect for carrying along to use in hotel rooms. Connecting to Wi-Fi during setup is a breeze — you just type in the Wi-Fi credentials right on the circular display.The Echo Spot does everything the Echo Show can do, which is a lot. Since it has a screen, it's technically more powerful than a regular Echo. You can glance at it to see the weather, news headlines, alarms, timers and more. You can ask it to order something from Amazon — I bought chocolates — and it's easy to swipe among the suggestions and order the one you want.It has a built-in front-facing camera that can be used to make video calls to other people with an Echo Show or Echo Spot. You can also make voice calls to regular phones or other Echos that don't have displays — you simply speak through the microphones and listen through the speakers.The speakers were surprisingly good for the size of the unit, but you'll need a larger Echo if you want to fill a good-sized room with music. The Spot is nice for light listening while reading, but not exactly something you'll throw a dance party with.Bonus: Lyrics are displayed for most songs, too, and you can sing along as they scroll across the screen.You can use the Echo Spot to control your smart home. Commands such as ""turn off the living room lights"" work well if you already have them configured.

You can use your own photos as the background or choose among a variety of pre-installed digital and analog faces. You can set alarms to wake you up to music of your choice, and the face dims at night so it doesn't keep you awake.I really wish Amazon embedded small batteries into its Echos, which would make them much more portable. The Echo Spot, like all other Echos, has to be plugged in at all times. It seems silly, since a relatively small battery could provide a few hours of music playback, and would make this perfect for moving around the house on a whim.Also, while the Echo Spot can play movies and TV shows from Amazon's Prime library, they're stamp-sized on the display, which means it's only really good for watching a quick trailer or finishing up a TV show in bed before turning off the lights.

The full-size Echo will give you better audio, and devices such as the Echo Plus can even get you started with a smart home, since it has a smart hub built inside.But if you own an Echo Dot (the smallest Echo without a display), this is a great upgrade from that. And if you already own a couple Echos, as I do, then the Echo Spot is a must-have. It's perfect for bedrooms, home offices (or your desk at work) and is a delight to use. It's my new favorite Echo, and easily worth the $129 asking price.PlayingShare this video...Watch Next...PlayingShare this video...Watch Next...PlayingShare this video...Watch Next...Roku Inc.: ""Roku's one of the most amazing short squeezes I've ever seen.

An employee pushes carts of empty boxes for customer orders at the Jet.com Inc. fulfillment center in Kansas City, Kansas.
 Wall Street rarely talks about its mistakes, but Citi Research admitted in a note to clients that it messed up with its previous call on Walmart.
 Citi Research raised its rating for Walmart shares to buy from neutral, citing the company's e-commerce progress.
""We sat on the sideline with this name in '17, which proved to be a big mistake. Despite the stock's run-up, we think there is even more to come, particularly considering HD and COST are trading at a premium to WMT,"" analyst Kate McShane wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""Our belief that its aggressive omnichannel strategy will continue to drive significant sales growth and WMT's ecommerce operations are emerging as a true challenger to Amazon, both factors that could fuel further multiple expansion.""
 Walmart shares were up about 1 percent Tuesday morning after the report.
The retailer is one of the market's best-performing large-cap stocks this year, rallying 42 percent through Monday versus the S&P 500's 20 percent gain.
McShane predicts Walmart will be able to report better-than-expected sales and profit margin results in the second half of 2018 due to ""supply chain efficiencies"" and its recent acquisitions.
As a result, she increased her fiscal 2019 earnings per share estimate for the retailer to $4.73 from $4.57.
Walmart's ""grocery offerings, everyday-low-price positioning and increasingly-seamless integration of store-based and digital selling will ensure consistent B&M [brick and mortar] traffic trends,"" she wrote.
The analyst raised her price target for Walmart shares to $117 from $106, representing 20 percent upside to Monday's close.

 All-America Economic Survey: 45% of consumers plan to do most of their holiday shopping online   
 7:02  AM ET Tue, 19 Dec 2017 |  01:38 
 Despite a world of e-commerce choices and possibilities, when it comes to where Americans shop online, there's really only one answer.
 Amazon.
For the second year in a row, more Americans will shop online for all or most of their holiday gifts, more than ever before in the 12-year history of CNBC's All-America Economic Survey.
 Forty-five percent said e-commerce is the top place they have shopped or plan to shop this season. While it's the second straight year that online is the top shopping destination, it's 5 percentage points above last year and more than twice as popular as it was a decade ago.
 But the real eye-opener is just how much Amazon dominates.
Seventy-six percent of Americans shopping online this holiday season expect to do most of that shopping on Amazon. No other retailer or website is even close to the king of the online jungle.
""As much choice or selection as the internet provides, it's just an amazing set of data to see all that concentrated in one online retailer,"" said Micah Roberts, a partner at research firm Public Opinion Strategies. ""It really underscores the dominance in that space.""
Walmart comes in second, but far behind, with only 8 percent of Americans who shop online searching or checking prices there, with other retailers clumped close behind the discounter.
 For Americans who shop online, 65 percent search on Amazon always or most of the time, up sharply each of the last 2 years.
Online conversion, or the rate of getting consumers who browse to follow through with a purchase, is notoriously small. Most estimates put the average rate of overall online conversion at around just 3 percent.
But Amazon has broken the mold on that one too, according to the results of CNBC's survey, with 57 percent of Amazon searchers buying on the site always or most of the time.
When asked what's most important when it comes to online shopping, 43 percent say free shipping. Of course, in order to get free shipping from Amazon, you have to spend at least $25 per order or pay $99 a year for a Prime Membership.
The ability to compare prices ranks second, at 26 percent, followed by the availability of product information at 18 percent.
But while price comparison is second in terms of importance, the digital divide within incomes persists when it comes to online shopping. Of Americans who do a lot or a fair amount of shopping online, 20 percent have incomes of $30,000 or less, while 62 percent make $100,000 or more.
 Certainly not all shopping will be done online this holiday season. After online as the top shopping choice, big box stores such Walmart or Best Buy are the next most frequented, at 28 percent.
While it's the fourth year in a row big box stores come in second, the number of shoppers is down 5 percentage points — or the same amount online has gained as a shopping preference. That's the channel's lowest percentage in the history of the survey, which began in 2006.
Department stores rank third and are also at the lowest percentage in the survey's history.
Despite the discussion surrounding consumer desire for unique products and the growth of transactions at local or small-business retailers, that category too has fallen in favor, with just 12 percent of Americans doing all or most of their holiday shopping in that type of store, the lowest level in six years.

 Cramer reviews the bear case for FANG stocks   
 6:39  PM ET Tue, 19 Dec 2017 |  00:57 
 After the decline in the FANG stocks on Tuesday, CNBC's Jim Cramer issued a warning to investors who own the technology-laden group.
 ""I just wanted to get in front of tomorrow's storyline,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""You better believe the obituary's being written once again right now, this time with the death notice containing two As and two Ns, as in FAANNG, or Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Nvidia and Google, the company now known as Alphabet.""
Weakness in the FAANNGs is bound to be taken seriously, which is why Cramer looked at the broader market layout, starting with the GOP-led tax overhaul.
 The sweeping tax cuts Republicans are chasing could put a trillion-dollar hole in the U.S. deficit. That would lead the government to borrow money, flooding the bond market with supply and driving interest rates higher.
But higher interest rates usually lead to higher inflation. Inflation erodes purchasing power, which in turn diminishes future earnings estimates.
""Given that the FAANNG stocks represent big bets on the future earnings of high-growth companies, ... inflation's real bad for them, so their stocks sell off when rates go up,"" Cramer said. ""Let me simplify it: higher rates often lead to lower prices for the most juiced stocks out there, and FAANNG be the king of the juice.""
To make sense of the noise (and explain why panic is fruitless), the ""Mad Money"" host went over each FAANNG stock's individual bear case.
 Facebook
 Word on Wall Street is that Facebook's next earnings report will be in line with estimates because the social media giant hasn't come up with a new, hot product in a while.
""It's become same-old, same-old — same-old, same-old great, I should add — and that's not enough for the market,"" Cramer said. ""I'm not kidding — that's really the rap against Facebook.""
 Amazon
 After Citi Research upgraded Walmart on Tuesday, saying that the retailer finally has enough online momentum to seriously compete with Amazon, the Amazon bears came running.
""I think Amazon is fabulous, especially its red-hot web services business,"" Cramer said, even as he agreed that Walmart is a formidable competitor. ""If we get any real weakness, I'll pound the table.""
 Apple
 Cramer has heard every bear case for Apple under the sun, including the latest downgrade that argued the tech stock's gains from the iPhone super-cycle are ""in the late innings.""
""Look, you may be tempted to sell it here and try to buy it back at lower levels,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""I think that's a fool's errand. I say own Apple, don't trade it. Every trading call to get out of Apple has been wrong. This piece did not change my mind.""
 Netflix
 In Cramer's opinion, Netflix's recent decline is all about Disney. Following the Disney-Fox deal, the bears are worried that Disney might build a competing streaming service.
""This is a tough one,"" Cramer admitted. ""I always think, though, what would it take to duplicate Netflix's business? I think certainly it would cost more than the company's current $80 billion valuation. That said, I will concede that it is definitely the most vulnerable of the FAANNGs.""
 Nvidia
 Nvidia's problem has consistently been that the semiconductor play has one of the most expensive stocks in the world.
But Cramer argued that the chipmaker dominates when it comes to gaming, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and the data center, even though its wares will certainly be challenged.
""Does that mean you should sell the stock? Look, Nvidia the stock has periodic swoons, and this one has lasted a long time, ever since the company reported,"" he said. ""I believe it's digesting a big move and this stock, like the other FAANNGs, is simply the victim of a rotation.""
 Alphabet
 The ""Mad Money"" host could hardly find a bear case for the parent company of Google.
""I think it's gaining market share and has about $100 billion in cash to fall back on,"" he said. ""Also, it [has] a swell web service business that's doing fantastically — not as good as Amazon, but still good — and an autonomous car business called Waymo that's second to none. Needless to say, I would not be a seller.""
 Final Thoughts
 In all his years in the business, Cramer has seen the FAANNG stocks pronounced dead plenty of times. But that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the underlying companies, he said.
""Don't let some analyst downgrade or some rotation out of high growth scare you away from owning some FAANNG,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Until I see a coroner's report from real competitors of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Nvidia and Alphabet, I think we need to presume that these stories remain very much alive.""

 Amazon's private-label push appears to just be taking off, but the internet giant still must prove its brands can hold their own amid a swelling marketplace of goods.
 A recent study by L2, a research firm that studies brands' digital performance, has identified more than 40 private brands associated with Amazon. (Some operate under trademarks filed by James F. Struthers, whose name has been affiliated with previous Amazon trademark applications.)
Twenty-nine of those labels are in the apparel space, according to L2. And Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2, has further noticed that Amazon is beginning to call out in search results which brands it owns, labeling items under ""Our Brand.""
 A separate study from retail and brands analytics firm 1010data found that Amazon's private-label products merely accounted for about 2 percent of total units sold on Amazon.com, excluding the retailer's third-party marketplace and subscription services, in the first half of 2017. Amazon didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on those reports.
All things considered, 2018 is likely to be the time for Amazon to prove the potential of its private-label business.
Many of Amazon's brands have quietly debuted in recent months. The company has been  notorious for not promoting an attachment to its brands online — but that could change next year, as the company masters its private-label approach.
""Private label is a big deal for any retailer, [and] if you can execute that's where you can have more control of your margins,"" Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea told CNBC. ""If you can get a dedicated private-label customer they will keep coming back because that's the only place they can get that brand.""
With its razor-thin profits, Amazon could use private labels as a way to finally scale operating margins. Costco's Kirkland Signature, Walmart's Great Value and Target's Cat & Jack are all examples of a similarly successful approach. A private-label line also allows a retailer to learn more about its shopper base — tracking exactly what they want and when.
This past year, Amazon rolled out multiple apparel lines and furniture brands, as it increasingly marketed its grocery labels including Wickedly Prime and Happy Belly, also adding more SKUs — like packaged nuts and spices — to those categories. 
In buying Whole Foods, Amazon also acquired the grocer's 365 brand. Even before its purchase by Amazon, Whole Foods had begun to roll out smaller-format stores dedicated to its private label. Analysts and industry consultants are already speculating these locations could become a testing ground for other Amazon-branded merchandise, for example clothing from its newer athletic apparel line Peak Velocity.
""From a digital perspective, Amazon has already increased the shelf space of private-label [products],"" L2's Smith told CNBC. ""I expect there will be a much larger push next year.""
In partnering with department store chain Kohl's to sell the Echo and other tech gadgets, Amazon could further negotiate a deal to use some of the retailer's real estate to sell its own apparel or food brands next year. Amazon also is preparing to launch a fashion service called Prime Wardrobe, which threatens the likes of Stitch Fix and Rent the Runway.
Amid this push, Amazon must be careful not to upset any of its established retail partners as its own products climb up the Amazon.com search ranks, Smith warned.
Amazon has added more established brands such as Nike and Calvin Klein to its website, luring in shoppers who recognize those labels. But while browsing Nike hoodies, shoppers will likely stumble upon Amazon's own.
""Big brands are getting frustrated ... they think [Amazon] is encroaching on their brands,"" he said.
According to 1010data, one of Amazon's private-label lines, AmazonBasics, delivered more than $200 million in sales during the first half of 2017, making it the company's most successful venture to date. AmazonBasics sells everything from batteries to phone chargers to wash cloths — mainly ""everyday essentials"" that shoppers are looking to pick up in a pinch.
Amazon Elements, which is known for its baby wipes and vitamin supplements, brought in about $9.5 million in sales, the firm found. Next in line, Amazon's labels including Pinzon for bedding, Happy Belly for snacks and Lark & Ro for women's fashion, each brought in more than $1 million in revenue for the first half of the year, 1010 data reported. 
For the time being, many of Amazon's newer private labels are still exclusively sold to Prime members, allowing the company to test what works and what doesn't with a smaller audience.
""My hypothesis is Amazon will find [private-label apparel] difficult until they learn to curate an assortment in a really unique way,"" Kantar Retail analyst Bryan Gildenberg told CNBC. ""I think in a number of categories we will see them learn and get better.""
It's no surprise Amazon aspires to grow its own brands. Private-label products have increased sales by 0.7 percent over the past four years, while branded products' sales fell 0.3 percent during the same period, according to Nielsen.
The associated negative stigma and ""quality gap"" between branded and private-label items is shrinking, according to Nielsen, which found nearly three-fourths of Americans are now saying a store brand can be a ""good alternative"" to a well-known (typically more expensive) brand.
In monitoring reviews on Amazon's private-label products online, Smith said he hasn't seen too many negative reviews, a sign the quality isn't terribly unsatisfactory. But the lines also haven't reached the point where shoppers are ""running home to tell their significant others"" about them, he added.
As Amazon looks to grow in grocery, Nielsen has also estimated that nearly 1 in every 5 items sold in U.S. supermarkets in 2016 was from a private-label brand, with store brands accounting for more than $150 billion in retail sales by themselves last year.
A separate report from Cadent Consulting Group is predicting private-label brands could ""steal"" as much as $64 billion from national names over the next decade, as millennials are becoming more receptive to shopping brandless than baby boomers.
""The way the Amazon model works is a great way to develop a private label,"" Kantar Retail's Gildenberg added. ""I think they'll find success in categories where they can do what they've always done — insert themselves into the value chain and create great economics.""

Holiday shoppers at Macy's in New York
 All signs point to the strongest holiday shopping season in years.
 There have been long lines at stores, record sales online, and the usual December lull — when shoppers typically disappear after Black Friday only to return in the final days before Christmas — hasn't been as quiet.
Retail consulting firm Customer Growth Partners raised its holiday sales forecast to 5.6 percent growth, up from 4.3 percent. If that pace holds, it would make 2017 the strongest holiday season since 2005, just prior to the Great Recession.
 To be sure, not every retailer will come out crowned a winner this year, as certain sectors are struggling more than others to win dollars against internet giant Amazon, which is predicted to capture as much as 50 percent of all online holiday sales.
The true test will come as companies begin to report their quarterly earnings, which include holiday sales, after the New Year.
""Not all retail sectors have thrived ... with women's apparel retailers and sporting goods seeing sluggish sales at best,"" CGP President Craig Johnson explained.
Some of the best growth is stemming from home improvement retailers, off-price chains and supercenters, according to his firm. That would include names like Home Depot, Lowe's, TJ Maxx, Ross Stores, Best Buy and Walmart — notably all of which are typically situated off-mall and in their own strip center.
On Wednesday, heading into the final days before Christmas, Home Depot, Lowe's and Ross all watched their stocks trade at all-time high levels.
At the malls, ""department stores, while far lagging peak performance levels of many years ago, are more of a mixed bag, with better in-store traffic than dour expectations, along with improving online growth,"" Johnson added.
Already falling victim to too much promotional activity, department store chain J.C. Penney warned in October that this holiday season would be another disappointment, slashing its 2017 profit and comparable sales forecasts. The company explained it had been discounting heavily ahead of the holidays to get rid of excess inventory.
Other mall stocks (including rivals Macy's and Kohl's) fell on the news, as investors have since feared this would become more of an industry-wide trend. Namely, Wall Street is still worried that some retail sectors aren't ringing up enough purchases to cover hefty expenses related to markdowns, returns, packaging and shipping, and other last-minute mishaps.
Teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters warned earlier this month that while it expects strong holiday earnings, fourth-quarter margins will likely be lower than a year ago, hampered by greater warehousing and shipping costs, and more promotions.
Meanwhile, companies such as Abercrombie & Fitch and Gap (with Old Navy and Athleta) have been pushing major store-wide sales, while names like Michael Kors and Urban Outfitters (with Anthropologie) appear to have tapered their deals, according to Jefferies analyst Randal Konik.
On a brighter note, the typical post-Black Friday lull hasn't been as pronounced this year, Konik added, based on his firm's latest mall checks. The traffic boost could help balance out apparel retailers' heavier promotions in particular.
While store traffic spiked over Thanksgiving weekend, shoppers are still hanging around, he said, and consistently so, ahead of ""Super Saturday"" — the last weekend shopping day before Christmas.
 The final countdown
 The clock is ticking, and the pressure is on for retailers to win sales of holiday procrastinators. This year, with Christmas falling on a Monday, there's one extra full weekend to ring up purchases, and that weekend could move the needle for some names.
""Super Saturday has gotten added importance given there is some momentum now on the brick-and-mortar side,"" Retail Metrics Founder Ken Perkins told CNBC. ""I think a really strong day would do a lot to give analysts more conviction to raise earnings estimates here.""
To date, Perkins has only seen a ""handful"" of industry analysts raise their fourth-quarter earnings projections albeit strong November sales results and heightened December momentum for many brands.
The 106 publicly traded retailers in Retail Metrics' earnings index (which includes names such as Sears, J.C. Penney, Costco and PVH) are currently expected to post a ""very modest"" 2.4 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings compared with a year ago, according to the firm.
Having been ""burned"" so many times in the past for setting expectations too high, this year Wall Street appears to be taking a more conservative approach, he said, and many people are awaiting Super Saturday, which could amount to the biggest shopping day of the year.
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are currently expecting a 1.7 percent jump overall in retailers' fourth-quarter same-store sales, which would be better than 2016's 0.8 percent increase, but not as good as some would anticipate with such lofty holiday projections.
 The National Retail Federation, the industry's trade group, has been more conservative and is sticking with its initial forecast, anticipating holiday retail sales to rise as much as 4 percent and reaching up to $682 billion. 
Meanwhile, retail stocks tell another part of the overall story. Some of the best performers include American Eagle, Gap, Michael Kors and Lululemon, while the laggards consist of struggling women's apparel brands Ascena Retail Group, Francesca's and Stein Mart, department store stocks, and those of their landlords.
Meanwhile, Evercore ISI recently calculated that over the past 20 years, there has been a roughly 85 percent correlation between the S&P 500's fourth-quarter performance and holiday retail sales. That index of stocks is up about 6.5 percent so far this quarter, implying holiday sales would climb as much as that amount.
""It will be interesting to see how everything pans out for everyone else,"" Perkins said. ""But of course, Amazon will have another stellar holiday.""

 Cramer: Here's why Amazon and Walmart exemplify the market's central theme   
 6:41  PM ET Thu, 21 Dec 2017 |  01:04 
 As 2017 comes to a close, CNBC's Jim Cramer has noticed that one of the market's starkest features is its shortage of stock.
 ""We don't have enough shares to go around. That's how I feel about this incredibly strong year and the uber-bullish reaction to tax reform,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""There's just not enough supply, not enough stock to meet the demand from buyers who had to radically switch their orientation to deal with a much more positive backdrop.""
Cramer tends to be skeptical when people bring up stock shortages, because bankers are usually prepared to issue shares to meet the market's demand, this time is different, he said.
 ""It's not a wholesale shortage of stock. It's a shortage of stocks that fit the program, meaning stocks belonging to companies that are high domestic taxpayers and thus just got a big boost to their earnings,"" he explained.
Ironically, Cramer found that two similar companies — Amazon and Walmart — best explain this oddity.
One one end there's Walmart, which pays a 32 percent effective tax rate that, with the GOP's tax overhaul, will soon be slashed to 21 percent. That makes it an attractive investment in this climate, but the company has been consistently buying back stock.
On the other end sits Amazon, which doesn't pay very many taxes despite having a 43 percent effective rate and has been consistently issuing stock over time.
The companies' 10-year track records are telling. Ten years ago, Walmart had 4.1 billion shares outstanding; as of last count, it had just under 3 billion. Over the same time period, Amazon's share count grew from 424 million to 494 million.
""Now, when portfolio managers want to reach for a big company that's a major beneficiary of the tax reform, you know what? They're thinking Walmart, not Amazon,"" Cramer said. ""In fact, you can easily imagine them dumping the fast-growing e-commerce play for Walmart here.""
Walmart's Jet.com business and ""buy online, pick up in-store"" initiatives were already attractive. Now, investors are eyeing the its stock thanks to new employee-friendly policies that keep workers there longer, thus cutting training costs, Cramer said.
""Walmart's got great fundamentals and it very much fits this program, ... but because of the buybacks, its stock is in even shorter supply than it would look like given that it is a $290 billion company,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Meanwhile, Amazon very much does not fit the program and there are a lot more shares to go around right now, floating all over the place.""
Certainly, Cramer was still bullish on the prospects for Amazon, the original A in his ubiquitous acronym, FANG.
Sellers of Amazon would probably regret it once they saw the online giant's likely robust holiday sales, and once the tax plan's benefits to Walmart were priced in, he argued.
""I'd be a buyer of Amazon into any weakness,"" Cramer said. ""But given that the passage of the bill was a surprise and the analysts are just now putting pen to paper to figured out its impact, my guess is that the out-of-Amazon-into-Walmart trade ... could continue for longer than people think.""
Amazon's issue stretches beyond its own stock, he added. Tech companies large and small have a lot of stock supply and aren't the biggest beneficiaries of the GOP tax plan, so they likely won't get much of a boost going into 2018.
At the same time, companies are still parsing how dramatically changes to the tax code could impact earnings, so Cramer weighed the possibility that the benefits could be even greater than expected.
""As always, there are things that could go wrong, especially some exogenous situation, a black swan,"" he said. ""The bottom line is that we're in a different, better and cheaper kind of market here. I'm the only one that seems to want to say it, but I don't care. I think it brings buyers in from the sidelines. Yep, we're looking at a wholesale re-allocation of capital that means you can keep buying this market on any dip, perhaps for quite some time to come.""

 Cramer Remix: If you sell Amazon now, you'll have seller's remorse

 As 2017 comes to a close, CNBC's Jim Cramer has noticed that one of the market's starkest features is its shortage of stock.

 Gold mining CEO talks bitcoin

A miner miniature figures near Bitcoin physical coin. Futures on Bitcoins increased by more than 20% after their American debut on the Chicago Cboe Futures Exchange.
 Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin may be all the rage, but when it comes to storing your money, Agnico Eagle Mines CEO Sean Boyd told CNBC that they still pose some unaddressed risks.
""One of the things about bitcoin and the cryptocurrencies is, is there really an unlimited supply?"" Boyd said to Cramer on Thursday. ""We're gold miners. We mine deposits. I think, over time, the question will be: are these cryptocurrencies and the developers of these cryptocurrencies just mining the public?""
Boyd, also the vice chairman of Agnico's board, echoed some technicians' sentiments that gold prices are turning and could be headed higher.
 Crypto showdown

 In a fireside chat on Thursday, Cramer told a caller that in the cryptocurrency markets, bitcoin seems to have a slight leg up against its fast-growing rival, Litecoin.
The ""Mad Money"" host said that the future of any cryptocurrency will hinge on the depth of its market and the disparity in futures prices.
That's why Cramer found it ""crazy"" that bitcoin futures, which are now listed on different exchanges, are so differently priced on each exchange.
""You can't have futures be that off,"" he said. ""What you're looking for is a market that is more transparent and has one price to it. I think the Lite[coin] market is probably going to be less deep than bitcoin because of the first-mover advantage.""
 Ansys CEO on Ferrari partnership
 Simulation software platform Ansys is used in much more than building engines and household appliances, President and CEO Ajei Gopal told Cramer on Thursday.
The company, whose software serves as a high-level engineering aid for designers and manufacturers, also works with companies like Ferrari to fine-tune their racecars.
""When you're in the business that they're in, where performance really matters, every millisecond makes a difference. And that millisecond makes a difference between winning and just being an also-ran,"" Gopal said. ""With Ansys technology, they can win.""
Ansys' software can create what the CEO called a ""digital wind tunnel"" in which it can simulate what the car will do on the racetrack in certain conditions.
""It's completely on the computer and it's built using Ansys technology,"" he said. ""In that digital wind tunnel, they can go through all of these what-if scenarios: what happens if I change the design of the car, how do I become more aerodynamic, how can I shave those few milliseconds of performance off, how can I improve the outcome?""
 Paychex CEO on GOP tax overhaul
 As the federal government begins to implement the newly passed Republican tax plan, Paychex President and CEO Marty Mucci shared his take on what it means for the country's payrolls.
""Probably, this'll happen in the February checks, because it's going to take them a few weeks to identify everything,"" he told Cramer regarding the impending tax code changes. Our systems are ready to go, but I think it'll take a few weeks, three or four weeks, to get it ironed out.""
And as the United States creeps closer to full employment, Mucci predicted that wages will need to go up as companies come to terms with the tax cuts they are likely to receive.
""As you get close to full employment, you're having more scarcity of resource and therefore [are] going to have to raise the wages a little bit more,"" Mucci said. ""And now with tax reform, we may see more wages go up because there's more ability to hire and pay a little bit more.""
 Lightning Round: A good bet in SWCH
 In Cramer's lightning round, he zoomed through his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
Switch Inc.: ""It does have an impressive client list. That's actually a really good way to look at it. And it's come down and I like the data center group very much. I happen to be partial more to CyrusOne. I think that they're really good. CoreSite [too]. But this is OK.""
Pure Storage: ""It's good, but I like Nutanix more. And, by the way, just in terms of that general rubric, obviously VMware's my fave.""

 });In 2009, executives at Domino's reevaluated their business model in light of an influx of customer complaints, such as ""Worst excuse for pizza I've ever had,"" ""Microwave pizza is far superior,"" and, frequently, ""Domino's tastes like cardboard.""
 Since 2010, the company's stock has appreciated 2000 percent, reports The Motley Fool, in that time frame outperforming the tech giants Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.
The Motley Fool's data extends to April 2017, when the value of Domino's stock was $180. Notably, that's lower than it's December value of $185 a share at the time of publication. 
 President and CEO Patrick Doyle turned the chain around so successfully, for one, by heeding the public's criticisms and making better pizza. But, more importantly, he invigorated focus on digital innovation and amped up their delivery service. Domino's now employs more people in their IT department than anywhere else in the company, reports CBS News, and over half of their sales come from digital platforms.
""With Domino's AnyWare, pizza can now be ordered through a variety of platforms, including Google Home, Amazon's Echo, Facebook Messenger, a smart TV, an Apple or Android smartwatch, a connected car, by texting, or by tweeting,"" notes The Motley Fool.

 They've literally made ordering a pizza as simple as tweeting out a pizza emoji.
If that wasn't enough, Domino's also managed to recently land the long-haired ""Stranger Things"" stud Joe Keery as a spokesperson. He's featured in a commercial recreating the running home-scene in the '80s hit ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" Only, in this case, Keery isn't trying to beat his parents home. He is trying to beat the pizza he is tracking on his phone, because you can also do that now.
Domino's stock has demonstrated consistent growth for years, and Doyle is continuously looking for opportunity to grow further, he told the Los Angeles Times, even if it means taking risks, such as when they added voice ordering to their app three years ago.
""That's the sort of thing that's not going to generate a fast return, but that's part of how you stay ahead of the market,"" he said.

An attendee operates the new Amazon Echo device.
 Amazon's innovative voice recognition Alexa device will boost the company's financial results, according to one Wall Street firm.
 RBC Capital Markets reaffirmed its outperform rating for the e-commerce giant, citing the firm's positive consumer survey results for the Alexa product.
""Following our third annual Alexa survey, we are more impressed with the traction of these devices and more convinced of their potential L-T term impact,"" analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ""With tens of millions of users and 20K+ skills, we see Alexa's value prop as becoming increasingly powerful as awareness an ownership ramp.""
 Mahaney reiterated his $1,200 price target for Amazon shares, representing nearly 2 percent upside to Wednesday's close.
""The win by the way for Amazon probably is not just selling devices ... 40 percent of people who own these [Alexa] devices shop more with Amazon,"" Mahaney said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Thursday. ""You are removing friction, you're creating more opportunities for Amazon to be there with its shopping cart.""
The analyst noted the firm's recent survey of consumers, which revealed awareness of Alexa rose to 89 percent from 77 percent over the last nine months. In addition, 15 percent of consumers said they owned the device, up 2 percentage points from the previous survey.
As a result, Mahney predicts Amazon will generate an additional $10 billion to $11 billion in sales from Alexa-related revenue in 2020. The sales forecast is a combination of device sales and incremental voice-driven e-commerce revenue from Alexa owners.
Amazon has ""one of the best management teams on the internet,"" he wrote. ""We are positive on management given their consistency, operational and strategic track record, focus on innovation and customer service, and long-term shareholder orientation.""
The company's shares have rallied 57 percent this year through Wednesday, compared with the market's 20 percent gain.

Blink will help Amazon catch up to Google's Nest, which began offering its own security system earlier this year and already sells an array of indoor and outdoor connected cameras.
It might also help Amazon improve its new Amazon Key in-home delivery system, which does not yet currently work with an alarm system.

Home Depot employee helps a customer as she shops in the paint department at the store in Miami.
 Home Depot has held internal discussions in recent months about a potential acquisition bid for XPO, a $9 billion publicly traded company that offers transportation, delivery and other logistics services for big retailers and brands, according to a person familiar with Home Depot's thinking.
If Home Depot were to make an offer, one main impetus would be to keep XPO out of the hands of Amazon — which the home improvement retailer believes has also considered buying the logistics company, the source said.
Recode could not independently confirm Amazon's interest in XPO, or if either Home Depot or Amazon have held talks with XPO. Both Home Depot and Amazon have been customers of XPO.
 Spokespeople for all three companies declined to comment.

While XPO offers a wide range of logistics and freight transportation services, it is probably best known to consumers as the company that manages the home delivery of heavy items such as furniture and appliances for retailers. The company calls itself ""the largest provider of last-mile logistics for heavy goods in North America.""
Earlier this year,  the Wall Street Journal reported that XPO was one of the main companies Amazon planned to work with as it made a big push in furniture sales.
Over the last few years, Amazon has taken over more control of its logistics,  buying stakes in cargo airlines,  handling more package delivery itself and  leasing thousands of its own truck trailers.
In 2015, XPO bought the trucking company Con-way for $3 billion, giving it a large fleet of its own trucks to offer freight transportation services. That same year, Home Depot named XPO the ""Mid-Size Truckload Carrier of the Year,""  according to an XPO press release.

Blink, a Boston-area start-up originally incorporated as Immedia Semiconductor. Blink makes wireless home security devices, including a camera and internet-connected doorbell that are compatible with the Amazon Echo. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, the company's investors confirmed that Immedia is being acquired in whole by Amazon. (It is not spinning out the Blink brand.)
Blink investor and board member David Aronoff, a general partner at Flybridge, told CNBC that the company's cameras have been popular because they work well in low-light environments, were affordable relative to competitors' devices, and were designed to be ""super low power""-- they run for two years on a pair of replaceable, AA lithium batteries. The acquisition could help make Amazon more competitive with Google and its Nest brand security systems.

 Small biz providing big power behind Amazon   
 9:19  AM ET Thu, 21 Dec 2017 |  01:14 
 It can be tough for small businesses to compete with the online retail giants of the world like Amazon. But when the two team up together, it can be a win for both parties.
 Amazon says that more than half of the items it sells online actually come from small businesses. A big driver of this trend is Fulfillment by Amazon, the program that lets small businesses offer Prime two-day shipping by preshipping their items to Amazon fulfillment centers, and letting the company handle packaging, shipping and customer service.
Some 2 billion items were sold this way across the globe last year alone, according to Amazon. And this year, small businesses sold 140 million items from the Thursday of Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday alone.
 To participate, Amazon charges fees for storage and shipping, depending on the size of the items. But small business owners like Steve Grubbs say it's well worth it.
Grubbs is owner of VictoryStore.com, based in Davenport, Iowa, and has been participating in the program for about five years. The fees can sometimes run him 30 percent, as he sells giant greeting cards and signs that can be 6 feet tall. But the payoff is exposure and new customers, who increasingly limit their searches on Amazon to Prime offerers. Today, about 70 percent of the $1.1 million he is on track to do this year is fulfilled by Amazon.
""People trust it — they know Amazon is going to take care of them and so they use Prime all the time now,"" Grubbs says. ""There are so many challenges with online retail and we've battled them for 20 years. Amazon takes a lot of those away — credit card security, marketing and sales, shipping and fulfillment.""
But the partnership also means small retailers can lose a degree of control. Jack Brecher, owner of JR William, a luxury goods retailer based in Queens, New York, says he has little contact with his customers and faces lower rankings on the site if he opts to fulfill items on his own.
""If your listing is fulfilled by merchant on Amazon, then the chances of you becoming a hot seller are slim to none,"" Brecher says. ""The positive aspects of using FBA can't be underestimated — not having to deal with shipments, specific issues with fulfillment. These are things that could take up all day for small business owners like myself. Time is our biggest resource and freeing up time is absolutely a huge value.""
Amazon does not reveal how many small business owners participate in the fulfillment program, but it defines them as businesses with 1,500 employees or fewer. Data analytics firm Potoo says there are some 4 million sellers on Amazon and the company adds more than 1,000 sellers daily. The number of sellers on Amazon has more than doubled in the past five years, Potoo says, adding that resellers are also included in this category.
Small business owners have mixed opinions on Amazon and what it means for Main Street. CNBC and SurveyMonkey polled small businesses on the e-commerce giant last quarter and found about one-third think Amazon is good for business, nearly half say Amazon is bad for business, but less than 10 percent said they actually compete with Amazon for customers.
One thing is for sure — as the FBA program and its sales grow, small retailers like Grubbs say competition is also on the rise.
""You need to keep prices as tight as you can, and you have to make sure you have products people want,"" Grubbs says. ""If you don't deliver a quality product, you won't get a high star rating and low ratings will kill your product.""

 Echo Dot and price wars help catapult Amazon as this year's leader in retail   
 12:56  PM ET Tue, 26 Dec 2017 |  04:34 
 Looking for an indicator that Amazon's Alexa is a beloved product? This holiday season, shoppers asked Alexa to order ... more Alexa devices. 
 The company said on Tuesday that it sold ""tens of millions"" of devices powered by its smart voice assistant.
 While there are scores of purchases that can be made using Alexa, the top purchases made through ""voice shopping"" were the Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, the company said.
Amazon's Alexa app also topped the App Store charts for Apple's iPhone,  presumably as people set up their new devices.
The small, inexpensive Echo Dot was the top-selling product on Amazon across all categories, and the newer Echo Spot and Echo Buttons also sold out.
Alexa also seems to be a big driver of the Fire TV category. Twice as many Fire TV Sticks (the less-sophisticated version) were purchased this year — but usage of Alexa on the higher-end Fire TV devices was 889 percent year over year in the U.S.
Alexa's breakout holiday seems to come hand-in-hand with a surge in smart-home interest in general: Smart plugs, smart light bulbs, and robot vacuums were also top sellers.
""The more that Amazon can not just get its Echo devices out there, but get its Alexa technology embedded in a variety of things, including cars, that'll be the long-term win,"" RBC analyst Mark Mahaney told CNBC's ""Squawk Alley"" on Tuesday.

 Amazon Prime members surge over the holiday season   
 11:44  AM ET Tue, 26 Dec 2017 |  00:45 
 It's just the day after Christmas, but Amazon is already boasting about a successful holiday season, calling 2017 the ""biggest"" ever.
 The e-commerce giant said Tuesday morning that customers were shopping on its website at ""record levels"" throughout November and December, and over the course of one week, more than 4 million people became Prime members or started a free trial, sending Amazon's membership count to new highs. However, the company didn't provide a specific membership total.
Meantime, Amazon said its devices also logged their best holiday, with the Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick leading the way. The Amazon Alexa app, which helps set up the company's voice-enabled devices to Wi-Fi, was a top downloaded application via Apple over the holiday weekend.
 The black and white versions of the Echo Dot (on sale for $29.99) were such a popular gift that as of Tuesday, they weren't available to be shipped from Amazon until early January.
The company also said shopping on its Amazon app increased nearly 70 percent this holiday season, as more customers become comfortable using their mobile devices to make purchases. Millions of tech gadgets were ordered from Amazon this way, the company added.
Other best-selling items through Christmas included the Instant Pot multicooker, WowWee Fingerlings toys, the Fitbit Charge 2 fitness tracker, a 23andMe DNA test and robot vacuums for cleaning around the house.
This holiday season, Amazon is again expected to grab the bulk, or more than 50 percent, of new digital sales. That leaves retailers like Walmart, Target, Kohl's and Best Buy thinking of new ways to either draw shoppers into stores or win dollars online.
In turn, Amazon has been looking to open more physical locations across the U.S. to make pickups and returns easier. Growing its private-label lines and partnering with other big-name retailers also remain in focus in the coming year.

 Amazon is planning a push into digital advertising in 2018   
 11:19  AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  00:50 
 Amazon has been quietly experimenting with various advertising products across its portfolio and off its website, according to interviews with half a dozen ad buyers and technology partners. And it's getting ready to make waves in 2018.
 Most of the conversations are focusing on new ad opportunities on Amazon's e-commerce search and video products, sources say. 
The company is also looking to sell advertising beyond Amazon sites and products. For example, a source with knowledge about the situation says it is working with third-party mobile advertising companies such as Kargo to pair advertising on television and on mobile screens.

 Echo Dot and price wars help catapult Amazon as this year's leader in retail   
 12:56  PM ET Tue, 26 Dec 2017 |  04:34 
 Ad industry sources also say Amazon is stepping up hiring for its advertising division, especially in the New York area. CFO Brian Olsavsky noted that the company was hiring more ad sales staff on its  Q2 earnings call in July.
Amazon did not respond to requests for comment on its advertising business.
 Why Amazon wants in
 Digital advertising was a $209 billion business globally in 2017, according to media buying research firm Magna Global. And it's only increasing: The company predicts the industry will grow 13 percent to $237 billion next year. The U.S. is currently the most lucrative market, where advertisers spent $40.1 billion on digital advertising during the first half of 2017 alone, according to digital ad industry group Interactive Advertising Bureau.
Although Amazon doesn't break out revenues from its advertising business, eMarketer estimates Amazon was the fifth-largest digital advertiser in the U.S. in terms of revenue this year. Still, it makes up a little more than 2 percent of the market. It's leagues below industry leaders Google and Facebook, which take home more than 70 percent combined, according to a recent estimate from analysts at Pivotal.
But advertisers have been searching for a third large competitor in order to lower prices and force Google and Facebook to be more open about sharing user data. Amazon could be a major player, if only based on the sheer volume of consumer insights it has thanks to its robust e-commerce business. 
Two media buyers said Amazon showed some willingness to share more user data than Google and Facebook have traditionally — if the advertising budget was big enough. 
As a result, advertisers are welcoming Amazon with open arms, with one media buyer saying some of its consumer packaged goods clients already spend more on Amazon search ads than Google.
Another media buyer said that while Google is still the search ad category leader, Amazon is gaining ground and budgets are quickly shifting in its direction.
""Driving conversion and sales or creating very immersive high-impact branded content is what drives a lot of digital advertising revenue,"" said Aaron Shapiro, CEO of advertising agency Huge. ""Amazon is a player in both those areas.""
 Amazon's expansion plans
 Amazon already allows companies to sponsor product listings so they will show up at the top of relevant search results in its store. It wants to expand, offering advertisers better data and algorithms to ensure its items get in front of the ideal customer. It's also selling custom pages with built-in video and stories to help advertisers' products stand out from the rest, such as this Acura ad.
 Companies can pay for sponsored listings, which ensure their products show up on the top of relevant search results.
 ""Amazon likes to talk about how 56 percent of product searches are coming through Amazon,"" said Diana Gordon, senior partner at media agency Mindshare. ""It's definitely a stat that causes advertisers to stand up."" 
If you remove the buy box on Amazon's site, it would rank in the top five of daily trafficked sites online, Gordon explained. Amazon can not only drive sales, it's becoming a place for people to read reviews.
""We know that consumers are using Amazon not only as retail, but also using it as product discovery and research,"" Gordon said. ""It could lead to making more purchases in brick-and-mortar stores."" 
Amazon also wants to expand video advertising business. In addition to allowing commercials on livestreamed content like it did on its Thursday Night Football streams this year, it's pitching companies on bespoke sponsored content. The branded videos would be created by established media publishers or by Amazon's own internal production team. Some ideas that are being floated around are creating infomercial-style videos for products with celebrity spokespeople.
""We have been having conversations of how do you take advantage of the video offering on Prime through digital advertising,"" said Sargi Mann, digital executive vice president at Havas Media Group. ""Instead of having superfluous ads, how can a brand have a part of that dialogue that is not advertising in its traditional form? I am always open and like to discuss new and innovative ways in media where ads can be more of an organic insertion."" 
In addition, the company has aspirations to expand advertising opportunities past owned-and-operated products. In December 2016, it launched cloud-based ad technology Transparent Ad Marketplace as a way for companies to buy display advertising on sites across the web. Header bidding services such as Transparent Ad Marketplace allow media buyers to bid on available advertising inventory before Google's DoubleClick can. Amazon wants to do more in the programmatic ad tech space, according to sources. 
The company is also looking to mobile ad technology partners to find ways to advertise across multiple devices. For example, it is in talks to work with Kargo to pair commercials with mobile ads, sources say. Theoretically, a sponsored product sold on Amazon would run during a TV show and then seconds later a viewer would be able to see a related ad on their mobile phone.
But Amazon has some disadvantages as it looks to take on pure-play advertisers Google and Facebook. In particular, working with Amazon causes conflict for some companies, since it is disrupting the way they traditionally sold products, forcing them to change strategies. 
""The reality is Amazon makes a lot of brands and companies nervous, and presence on Amazon is a necessary evil,"" said Thomas Choi, RPA chief product officer of media. ""For others in categories like automotive, it's going to replace the existing sales and purchase process. It's a little bit of a mixed bag about how brands perceive them.""

 Kanye West gave Kim Kardashian stocks for Christmas   
 9:19  AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  01:01 
 At Christmas, it's common for toys, gift cards and socks to be traditional stocking fillers — but how about company stocks?
 This holiday season, rap star Kanye West gave wife and entrepreneur, Kim Kardashian, stocks from major U.S. corporations, including Netflix, Amazon and Apple.
""So for one of my Christmas presents from Kanye, he gives me this little box with a Disney Mickey toy, Apple headphones, Netflix (and) Amazon gift cards and Adidas socks,"" said Kim Kardashian, entrepreneur and reality TV star, on one of her latest Instagram stories, posted Tuesday.

 ""But then, I open the next box and it is stock to Amazon, where he got the gift cards, stock to Netflix, stock to Apple – hence the little headphones, Adidas stock and Disney stock.""
In the Instagram story, Kardashian received 920 Walt Disney shares, which are worth approximately $100,000, according to the certificate. She also received around 995 shares of stock of Adidas.
Following a bumper year for U.S. stock markets — with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting 24,000 for the first time this year — a number of the companies that Kardashian mentioned, have performed strongly over the course of 2017.

Stores can no longer rely on malls for foot traffic and food giants increasingly can't rely on supermarkets for aisle visits.Retailers, whose boldest efforts to grow through to scale over the past few years were blocked by regulators, looked for new kinds of deals. This time around, they sought capabilities (digital, services), not more unused store space. The value of worldwide retail deals was $132 billion in 2017, a roughly 90 percent jump from the year prior, according to Dealogic. When they weren't doing deals, they were finding a partner to dance. Walmart and Amazon actively courted partners (Lord and Taylor, Kohl's as examples) as part of their ongoing battle for retail domination.Food companies, meanwhile, continued their quest for growth as pressure on them intensified and attempts to grow or innovate on their own continued to largely stall. That pressure seemed to have risen to the top of the C-suite, as an inordinate number of food CEOs stepped down this year or announced plans to. They included Mondelez's Irene Rosenfeld, General Mills' Ken Powell and Kellogg's John Bryant.Here are five lessons we learned this year. (You already know which deal topped the list, so feel free to read through slowly and enjoy the ride.)Chewy, founded in 2011, was a quickly growing online seller of pet food. Its roughly $3 billion sale to PetSmart was one of the biggest ever e-commerce deals. It demonstrated how swiftly the retail landscape is changing and the big bets retailers are now willing to make. (Though admittedly easier to do when a company, like PetSmart, is private.)PetSmart was acquired by a BC Partners-led consortium in 2015 for roughly $8.7 billion, back when private equity investors touted the idea that ""pet parents"" would always and only go into stores to buy for their pets. Under BC Partners, it toyed with the idea of merging with rival Petco, an effort that stalled amid antitrust concerns.But the rise of e-commerce came at the industry fast. More stores are no longer the solution, and it turns out pet parents are more than happy to buy their food and products online. In buying Chewy, PetSmart sought to stamp out a competitor and build an internet presence and infrastructure faster than it could on its own.When the deal was announced, industry sources pointed to the surprising size of the deal, having found traditional retailers generally weary of making similar bets. They said to watch it as one of the first tests of large-scale unions of brick-and-mortar and e-commerce.The marriage has gotten off to a rocky start. Several independent food companies like Champion Petfoods and Fromm Family Foods announced they were pulling their products from Chewy, angered over its sale to a corporate owner. High-end dog food brand Blue Buffalo, a Chewy favorite, went mass, selling in retailers like Target. PetSmart CEO Michael Massey announced he was stepping down in August, four months after the deal was announced. It has also taken longer than expected to achieve its synergies and its bonds have taken a hit. Earlier this month ratings firm S&P Global Ratings downgraded its corporate credit rating based on weakening operating performance and finances.Some sources close to the situation say that PetSmart had little choice but to make a big e-commerce investment like Chewy. The sources also note it is still relatively early days, and the two may be able to find a balance.The deal was not the sexiest of the year, but it was a sign of what to come.Reckitt Benckiser Group put its North American food business on the block to pay down debt following its $16.6 billion acquisition of U.S. baby formula maker Mead Johnson. It was one of several CPG carve-outs this year, as food companies seek to realign their business. The assets included Frank's Red Hot sauce business, French's mustard and Cattlemen business.At the onset, industry insiders expected a crowded sale process — it was one of the few food businesses of scale that was still growing, and companies have waited for years for it to be up for sale. No one, though, anticipated the price it would fetch.Spice-maker McCormick beat out a number of interested parties, including Conagra and Unilever, paying a whopping $4.2 billion — or 19.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The long-term average of major deals in the sector meanwhile is 16.2 times, according to Bernstein analysts.McCormick's CEO took to CNBC to defend the deal price. Industry sources said the it may have set a new bar.Others later joined McCormick in doling out big prices grasping at growth. Kellogg is buying upstart protein-bar company RXBar for $600 million. Campbell Soup and Hershey both announced their largest ever deals earlier this month.Expect more big prices and food deals to come in 2018.Sycamore Partners' $6.9 billion acquisition of Staples was the not-so-little deal that could. Staples was yet another company that had previously weighed scale to cope with a changing shopping landscape. Its efforts to merge with rival retailer Office Depot though were thwarted by a U.S. federal judge on antitrust grounds.The company, which made its name selling papers and pens, has for years been hurt by the digitization of the workplace and increased competition from online retailers. Its stock was pounded as it got swept up in general investor aversion to any retailer in the stock market not named Amazon or Walmart. It was one of several publicly traded retailers that sought escape in the private market (others included Party City and Nordstrom) but, with financing markets spooked, it was one of the few to find refuge. Its saving grace was its growing business-to-business platform, which some buyers thought to be a diamond in the rough. The question was how to disentangle it from its struggling retail business. That challenge scared off a number of financial buyers, including Cerberus Capital Management.Sycamore's aggressively creative co-founder forged a way.The private equity firm split the retailer into three parts. This allowed banks to finance the strongest parts of the business separately and give Sycamore the option to wind down its weakest unit — the retail business — at a later date. The move followed a playbook the private equity firm used in its purchase of The Jones Group.Other retailers looking for a similar escape valve may next year be able to find one: Sycamore is looking to raise largest ever fund, which will continue to focus on retail investments. It's still too early to asses what Sycamore is able to do with the business, but Amazon has already made clear it plans to be a competitor. In October, it announced the launch of Business Prime Shipping, a membership program for multi-user businesses.CVS Health's landmark roughly $69 billion acquisition Aetna will create the first health-care triple threat, combining CVS's pharmacy and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) platform with Aetna's insurance business.Some sources close to the deal adamantly say that Amazon was not behind the transaction, but in today's world, everything is a reaction to Amazon, directly or indirectly. Over the past year, Amazon had made its presence known in the drug retail space, more recently having held preliminary talks with makers of generic drugs about its potential entry into the space, according to people familiar with the discussions. Drug stores were already under pressure, as shoppers can now find cosmetic and household staples at other retailers and online, sometimes for a lower price.Continuing a theme on this list, efforts to scale horizontally haven't gone through, and may now no longer make sense. Walgreen's attempt to buy Rite Aid in a $17.5 billion deal was whittled by regulators down to a purchase of 1,932 stores for $4.37 billion.Now that CVS/Aetna is announced, industry sources anticipate further deals. On the retail front, sources have said that, in order of likelihood, Walgreens, Walmart and Kroger may make similar health-care plays. Rite Aid has been identified by sources as a private equity target.The deal so big it inspired a meme. When Amazon announced it was buying the high-end grocer for $13.7 billion, shares of dozens of supermarkets, food producers, payment processors and shopping malls collectively lost at least $35 billion in U.S. market value. The deal merged Amazon's technology and data with Whole Food's brand loyalty and roughly 400-store footprint.The weeks that followed were replete with banker pitches and harried board meetings. Sources say the deal has fundamentally changed how companies are thinking about their future. Meetings now devote special time to discussing ""how to defend against Amazon."" That is, of course, when they're not asking whether Amazon can simply buy them and save them from their troubles. Kroger and Walmart have both stepped up their games in light of the deal. Kroger announced earlier this year it is weighing a sale of its strong convenience store business, a move some sources say the grocer wouldn't be doing if didn't feel under pressure to invest its core business. Both have focused on automation, a tool industry watchers expect Amazon to further harness in 2018.Meantime, Walmart is testing automated store technology through its startup incubator, Store No. 8, Recode reported earlier this month. Kroger plans to roll out similar technology through its ""Scan, Bag, Go"" app. For food companies, the deal highlighted the need to invest in e-commerce, a topic that has become a main point of discussion. Amid their concerns: whether people will still buy their products on Amazon (shoppers may be less inclined to make impulsive purchases of Oreos when they shop online) and what Amazon will do with Whole Foods' private label brands. 2017 was the year challenges facing retailers began to bleed into the consumer goods and food industries.As shoppers continue their shift online, companies are trying to figure out not only what shoppers want, but how to get it to them.

Several independent food companies like Champion Petfoods and Fromm Family Foods announced they were pulling their products from Chewy, angered over its sale to a corporate owner. High-end dog food brand Blue Buffalo, a Chewy favorite, went mass, selling in retailers like Target. PetSmart CEO Michael Massey announced he was stepping down in August, four months after the deal was announced. It has also taken longer than expected to achieve its synergies and its bonds have taken a hit. Earlier this month ratings firm S&P Global Ratings downgraded its corporate credit rating based on weakening operating performance and finances.Some sources close to the situation say that PetSmart had little choice but to make a big e-commerce investment like Chewy. The sources also note it is still relatively early days, and the two may be able to find a balance.The deal was not the sexiest of the year, but it was a sign of what to come.Reckitt Benckiser Group put its North American food business on the block to pay down debt following its $16.6 billion acquisition of U.S. baby formula maker Mead Johnson. It was one of several CPG carve-outs this year, as food companies seek to realign their business. The assets included Frank's Red Hot sauce business, French's mustard and Cattlemen business.At the onset, industry insiders expected a crowded sale process — it was one of the few food businesses of scale that was still growing, and companies have waited for years for it to be up for sale. No one, though, anticipated the price it would fetch.Spice-maker McCormick beat out a number of interested parties, including Conagra and Unilever, paying a whopping $4.2 billion — or 19.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The long-term average of major deals in the sector meanwhile is 16.2 times, according to Bernstein analysts.McCormick's CEO took to CNBC to defend the deal price. Industry sources said the it may have set a new bar.Others later joined McCormick in doling out big prices grasping at growth. Kellogg is buying upstart protein-bar company RXBar for $600 million. Campbell Soup and Hershey both announced their largest ever deals earlier this month.Expect more big prices and food deals to come in 2018.Sycamore Partners' $6.9 billion acquisition of Staples was the not-so-little deal that could. Staples was yet another company that had previously weighed scale to cope with a changing shopping landscape. Its efforts to merge with rival retailer Office Depot though were thwarted by a U.S. federal judge on antitrust grounds.The company, which made its name selling papers and pens, has for years been hurt by the digitization of the workplace and increased competition from online retailers. Its stock was pounded as it got swept up in general investor aversion to any retailer in the stock market not named Amazon or Walmart. It was one of several publicly traded retailers that sought escape in the private market (others included Party City and Nordstrom) but, with financing markets spooked, it was one of the few to find refuge. Its saving grace was its growing business-to-business platform, which some buyers thought to be a diamond in the rough. The question was how to disentangle it from its struggling retail business. That challenge scared off a number of financial buyers, including Cerberus Capital Management.Sycamore's aggressively creative co-founder forged a way.The private equity firm split the retailer into three parts. This allowed banks to finance the strongest parts of the business separately and give Sycamore the option to wind down its weakest unit — the retail business — at a later date. The move followed a playbook the private equity firm used in its purchase of The Jones Group.Other retailers looking for a similar escape valve may next year be able to find one: Sycamore is looking to raise largest ever fund, which will continue to focus on retail investments. It's still too early to asses what Sycamore is able to do with the business, but Amazon has already made clear it plans to be a competitor. In October, it announced the launch of Business Prime Shipping, a membership program for multi-user businesses.CVS Health's landmark roughly $69 billion acquisition Aetna will create the first health-care triple threat, combining CVS's pharmacy and pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) platform with Aetna's insurance business.Some sources close to the deal adamantly say that Amazon was not behind the transaction, but in today's world, everything is a reaction to Amazon, directly or indirectly. Over the past year, Amazon had made its presence known in the drug retail space, more recently having held preliminary talks with makers of generic drugs about its potential entry into the space, according to people familiar with the discussions. Drug stores were already under pressure, as shoppers can now find cosmetic and household staples at other retailers and online, sometimes for a lower price.Continuing a theme on this list, efforts to scale horizontally haven't gone through, and may now no longer make sense. Walgreen's attempt to buy Rite Aid in a $17.5 billion deal was whittled by regulators down to a purchase of 1,932 stores for $4.37 billion.Now that CVS/Aetna is announced, industry sources anticipate further deals. On the retail front, sources have said that, in order of likelihood, Walgreens, Walmart and Kroger may make similar health-care plays. Rite Aid has been identified by sources as a private equity target.The deal so big it inspired a meme. When Amazon announced it was buying the high-end grocer for $13.7 billion, shares of dozens of supermarkets, food producers, payment processors and shopping malls collectively lost at least $35 billion in U.S. market value. The deal merged Amazon's technology and data with Whole Food's brand loyalty and roughly 400-store footprint.The weeks that followed were replete with banker pitches and harried board meetings. Sources say the deal has fundamentally changed how companies are thinking about their future. Meetings now devote special time to discussing ""how to defend against Amazon."" That is, of course, when they're not asking whether Amazon can simply buy them and save them from their troubles. Kroger and Walmart have both stepped up their games in light of the deal. Kroger announced earlier this year it is weighing a sale of its strong convenience store business, a move some sources say the grocer wouldn't be doing if didn't feel under pressure to invest its core business. Both have focused on automation, a tool industry watchers expect Amazon to further harness in 2018.Meantime, Walmart is testing automated store technology through its startup incubator, Store No. 8, Recode reported earlier this month. Kroger plans to roll out similar technology through its ""Scan, Bag, Go"" app. For food companies, the deal highlighted the need to invest in e-commerce, a topic that has become a main point of discussion. Amid their concerns: whether people will still buy their products on Amazon (shoppers may be less inclined to make impulsive purchases of Oreos when they shop online) and what Amazon will do with Whole Foods' private label brands. 2017 was the year challenges facing retailers began to bleed into the consumer goods and food industries.As shoppers continue their shift online, companies are trying to figure out not only what shoppers want, but how to get it to them. Stores can no longer rely on malls for foot traffic and food giants increasingly can't rely on supermarkets for aisle visits.Retailers, whose boldest efforts to grow through to scale over the past few years were blocked by regulators, looked for new kinds of deals. This time around, they sought capabilities (digital, services), not more unused store space. The value of worldwide retail deals was $132 billion in 2017, a roughly 90 percent jump from the year prior, according to Dealogic. When they weren't doing deals, they were finding a partner to dance. Walmart and Amazon actively courted partners (Lord and Taylor, Kohl's as examples) as part of their ongoing battle for retail domination.Food companies, meanwhile, continued their quest for growth as pressure on them intensified and attempts to grow or innovate on their own continued to largely stall. That pressure seemed to have risen to the top of the C-suite, as an inordinate number of food CEOs stepped down this year or announced plans to. They included Mondelez's Irene Rosenfeld, General Mills' Ken Powell and Kellogg's John Bryant.Here are five lessons we learned this year.

(You already know which deal topped the list, so feel free to read through slowly and enjoy the ride.)Chewy, founded in 2011, was a quickly growing online seller of pet food. Its roughly $3 billion sale to PetSmart was one of the biggest ever e-commerce deals. It demonstrated how swiftly the retail landscape is changing and the big bets retailers are now willing to make. (Though admittedly easier to do when a company, like PetSmart, is private.)PetSmart was acquired by a BC Partners-led consortium in 2015 for roughly $8.7 billion, back when private equity investors touted the idea that ""pet parents"" would always and only go into stores to buy for their pets. Under BC Partners, it toyed with the idea of merging with rival Petco, an effort that stalled amid antitrust concerns.But the rise of e-commerce came at the industry fast.

(Though admittedly easier to do when a company, like PetSmart, is private.)PetSmart was acquired by a BC Partners-led consortium in 2015 for roughly $8.7 billion, back when private equity investors touted the idea that ""pet parents"" would always and only go into stores to buy for their pets. Under BC Partners, it toyed with the idea of merging with rival Petco, an effort that stalled amid antitrust concerns.But the rise of e-commerce came at the industry fast. More stores are no longer the solution, and it turns out pet parents are more than happy to buy their food and products online. In buying Chewy, PetSmart sought to stamp out a competitor and build an internet presence and infrastructure faster than it could on its own.When the deal was announced, industry sources pointed to the surprising size of the deal, having found traditional retailers generally weary of making similar bets. They said to watch it as one of the first tests of large-scale unions of brick-and-mortar and e-commerce.The marriage has gotten off to a rocky start. Several independent food companies like Champion Petfoods and Fromm Family Foods announced they were pulling their products from Chewy, angered over its sale to a corporate owner. High-end dog food brand Blue Buffalo, a Chewy favorite, went mass, selling in retailers like Target. PetSmart CEO Michael Massey announced he was stepping down in August, four months after the deal was announced. It has also taken longer than expected to achieve its synergies and its bonds have taken a hit. Earlier this month ratings firm S&P Global Ratings downgraded its corporate credit rating based on weakening operating performance and finances.Some sources close to the situation say that PetSmart had little choice but to make a big e-commerce investment like Chewy. The sources also note it is still relatively early days, and the two may be able to find a balance.The deal was not the sexiest of the year, but it was a sign of what to come.Reckitt Benckiser Group put its North American food business on the block to pay down debt following its $16.6 billion acquisition of U.S. baby formula maker Mead Johnson. It was one of several CPG carve-outs this year, as food companies seek to realign their business. The assets included Frank's Red Hot sauce business, French's mustard and Cattlemen business.At the onset, industry insiders expected a crowded sale process — it was one of the few food businesses of scale that was still growing, and companies have waited for years for it to be up for sale. No one, though, anticipated the price it would fetch.Spice-maker McCormick beat out a number of interested parties, including Conagra and Unilever, paying a whopping $4.2 billion — or 19.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The long-term average of major deals in the sector meanwhile is 16.2 times, according to Bernstein analysts.McCormick's CEO took to CNBC to defend the deal price. Industry sources said the it may have set a new bar.Others later joined McCormick in doling out big prices grasping at growth. Kellogg is buying upstart protein-bar company RXBar for $600 million. Campbell Soup and Hershey both announced their largest ever deals earlier this month.Expect more big prices and food deals to come in 2018.The deal was not the sexiest of the year, but it was a sign of what to come.Reckitt Benckiser Group put its North American food business on the block to pay down debt following its $16.6 billion acquisition of U.S. baby formula maker Mead Johnson.

 Trader sees Amazon breakout out to new highs   
 9:00  AM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 |  04:18 
 High-flying Amazon's record run will continue into next year.
 That's according to Todd Gordon, founder of TradingAnalysis.com, who says the charts are pointing to record highs for Amazon in early 2018. The online retailer has already surged 58 percent this year, and Gordon says the stock is poised to exceed the $1,200 mark.
""[There has been a] very nice uptrend that has been in place since the end of the fall of 2017, and it looks like it's continuing up through the winter and early part of 2018,"" he said Thursday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""The first thing I'll draw your attention to is the first significant correction we saw here in late October was roughly equal to the size of the correction that we saw here in the end of November into December.""
 This symmetry gives the technician faith that following the consolidation in Amazon that has happened recently, the stock will be ready to break through $1,200.
 To establish a trade in Amazon, Gordon looks at the stock's performance over the past several weeks. He points out that a key support level for Amazon is now around $1,170, which used to be resistance until this month, when the stock would bounce from that level after falling down. Gordon believes that given the momentum Amazon has seen, he would only be concerned if the stock were to fall below that support level to around $1,160.
 As a result, Gordon wants to sell the Feb. 2 weekly 1,155-strike put and pair that with the purchase of the Feb. 2 weekly 1,150-strike put for $1.60 credit, or $160 credit per options spread. The $160 becomes the maximum reward that Gordon could get on the trade provided that Amazon closes above $1,155 on Feb. 2 expiration. If Amazon were to close below $1,150 on Feb. 2, then Gordon would see a maximum loss of $340.
Despite the skewed risk-to-reward ratio, Gordon isn't concerned as the key levels for his trade are about $30 lower than from where shares of Amazon were trading Thursday. In order for Gordon to see that maximum loss, Amazon would have to fall more than 3 percent below current levels.
The online retailer closed at $1,186.10 on Thursday.

 These companies are in the race to a $1 trillion valuation   
 12:20  PM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 |  04:32 
 MKM Partners predicts Alibaba will reach the vaunted trillion-dollar valuation ahead of its internet peers.
 ""It seems likely to us that we will have multiple $1 trillion valuation companies within the next 1-3 years if the current bull market continues. In this note, we examine the pathways of the six leading contenders: Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Tencent and Alibaba,"" analyst Rob Sanderson wrote in a note to clients Friday entitled ""Pathways to $1 Trillion Valuation and Who Arrives There First.""
""An argument can be made for each company achieving $1 trillion in market cap by 2020, with a case for Apple in 2019. We think it's most likely 2021 when the barrier is broken by an Internet company, but think BABA may have the best chance for 2020 despite being the smallest of the mega-caps today.""
 Sanderson reiterated his buy rating and $220 price target on Alibaba shares, representing 28 percent upside from Thursday's close.
Alibaba has a market value of nearly $440 billion, according to FactSet. Its shares have shot up 96 percent this year, compared with the S&P 500's 20 percent return.
The analyst noted online commerce is growing more than twice the rate in China versus the U.S., while Alibaba's monetization rate is one-sixth to one-eighth of Amazon's.
""We believe that opportunities for further monetization gains are plentiful, largely within the company's control and that ad-loads represent a considerable growth driver that is at the discretion of management,"" he wrote. ""We think that BABA may have the best chance among Internet mega-caps to become the first $1 trillion company.""
Sanderson believes Alibaba can reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2020 if it generates earnings-per-share 20 percent above expectations in 2018, grows earnings by 45 percent in 2019 and preserves its 24 times forward price-earnings ratio.
To be sure, the analyst said there were many risks to Alibaba's future including its ability to raise ad load, prospects for its many investments such as Ant Financial, and losses from its Alicloud and other businesses.

 President Trump slams Amazon, telling U.S. post office to charge more   
 11:21  AM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 |  02:48 
 President Donald Trump took aim at the U.S. Postal Service on Friday for offering Amazon and other e-commerce companies low rates for package delivery. 
 Tweet
 The USPS, when reached by CNBC, said it is looking into the issue. 
 At the heart of the issue is the Postal Service's essentially monopolistic hold on the letter business and whether it is using that clout to subsidize the cost of its package delivery.
To prevent an unfair advantage in letter mail, the government has tightly controlled how much USPS charges for its letters. It also instituted reforms to ensure it does not use its letter business to support its package delivery business. (In other words, use revenue from its high-margin mail business to lower the cost of its package delivery.) Doing so would give it an unfair edge over commercial carriers such as FedEx and United Parcel Service. 
Those reforms, some have argued, are out of date. 
The government in 2006 passed the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, saying the Postal Service cannot price its parcels below cost. A year later, the government clarified that 5.5 percent of the USPS' fixed costs must be allocated to packages and the like.
But mailing patterns have changed drastically over the past decade, and that 5.5 percent benchmark has become minuscule as the volume of packages that USPS delivers skyrockets. 
The USPS delivered 5.7 billion packages in 2017, a 27 percent jump from 2015. It delivered 58.7 billion first class mailings, a decline of 6 percent from 2015.
""We contend that this floor for competitive (parcel) products has been maintained at artificially low levels, creating large-scale systemic economic inefficiencies engendered by what is effectively a government-enforced taxpayer subsidization of the USPS' irrational pricing,"" wrote analysts at Citi in April. 
The package pricing, argued Citi, hurts USPS' competitors, who have to match similar pricing. It may also be hurting USPS itself. 
USPS reported $69.6 billion in sales in fiscal 2017, a 2 percent drop from the year prior. It reported a loss of $2.7 billion in 2015, down from a loss of $5.6 billion a year prior.
The question thus arises as to why the mailing service appears to be undercutting itself. As letter mailing increasingly becomes a smaller piece of the business in the future, the service may not want to mess with the growth it sees in packages.
Meantime, while it could now be argued Amazon needs USPS more than the reverse, there always remains a threat Amazon could buy its own delivery service. 
An earlier version of this story misstated the number of packages USPS delivered in fiscal 2017.

A worker pulls carts full of customer orders along the floor inside the million-square foot Amazon distribution warehouse that opened last fall in Fall River, MA.
 Land fit for future fulfillment centers for the likes of Amazon and Walmart saw huge spikes in prices last year, according to real estate services firm CBRE.
 In a trend largely stemming from the growth of e-commerce players across the U.S., some plots of land now cost twice the amount they did a year ago, the group found. This is especially true in major markets, including Atlanta and Houston.
In surveying 10 U.S. markets, CBRE found the average price for ""large industrial parcels"" (50 to 100 acres) now sits at more than $100,000 per acre, up from about $50,000 a year ago.
 Industrial land plots of five to 10 acres, which typically house infill distribution centers for completing ""last-mile"" deliveries, watched their prices soar to more than $250,000 per acre by the end of 2017, up from roughly $200,000 a year ago, according to CBRE. Located in more bustling metropolitan settings, these warehouses must help retailers serve consumers closer to their homes.
To be sure, industry experts say that despite an uptick in construction of late, there's still a long way to go before supply aligns with demand.

 ""Escalating land prices are a big reason why new supply of U.S. warehouses and distribution centers hasn't kept pace with strong demand in recent years,"" David Egan, the global head of CBRE's Industrial & Logistics Research division, said in a statement.
""This situation won't go away any time soon, because the markets where distribution centers are most in demand — typically near or in densely populated city centers — have scant available land for industrial uses,"" Egan added.
According to CBRE's annual research, the most active warehouse construction markets today include California's Inland Empire, northern New Jersey, Chicago and Las Vegas.
Average industrial land prices in Inland Empire mushroomed 35 percent in 2017, the group found. Prices in northern New Jersey and Las Vegas jumped 17 percent, while prices in Chicago were up about 16 percent.

 Amazon has big plans for Alexa ads in 2018   
 5:08  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018 |  00:55 
 Amazon is turning to Alexa and asking it to build a big digital advertising business.
 The e-tailer has been in talks with several companies about letting them promote products on the best-selling Echo devices, which are powered by the Alexa voice assistant, according to several people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. Consumer companies, including Procter & Gamble and Clorox, have been involved in these talks, according to the people.
Some of the early discussions have centered on whether companies would pay for higher placement if a user searches for a product such as shampoo on the device, similar to how paid searches work in Google. 
 The move by Amazon, which right now does very little advertising on the Echo, could mean big things for consumer companies that are fretting their influence on a voice-powered shopping experience.  
With Alexa's clout anticipated to rise, brands are worried about being left out of the voice-shopping platform entirely. Advertisers and brands are particularly focused on search placement on Alexa because shoppers are more likely to select a top result on a voice assistant than they are on the web, where it's easy to scroll down or ignore written suggestions.
Amazon has hinted in the past that it will launch a paid search ad product for Alexa, but sources said that the latest talks show the e-commerce giant is preparing to make a serious run at the ad market as early as this year.

 Amazon in talks with P&G, Clorox for Alexa ads: Sources   
 1:22  PM ET Tue,  2 Jan 2018 |  01:12 
 CNBC reported last week that Amazon is testing a number of ad types, including videos, for 2018.
While Amazon dominates online commerce, its web advertising business ranks fifth among U.S. companies, according to eMarketer. Amazon's ad sales, which today mostly come from sponsored listings on the website, will grow 42 percent in 2018 to $2.4 billion, still putting the company way behind Google at $40.1 billion and Facebook at $21.6 billion, eMarketer said.
With Alexa, where advertising is currently limited, Amazon is in talks to offer companies a variety of promotional opportunities, including some that are already being tested.  
One experiment in the works is letting companies target users based on past shopping behavior. For example, Alexa may suggest to a shopper who previously bought Clorox's Pine-Sol to consider buying its disinfecting wipes. Amazon is also looking to tap advertising in Alexa's skills. Someone asking the Echo for help cleaning up a spill might be nudged to use a specific brand.

 Amazon is planning a push into digital advertising in 2018   
 11:19  AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  00:50 
 There are already some sponsorships on Alexa that aren't tied to a user's history. If a shopper asks Alexa to buy toothpaste, one response is, ""Okay, I can look for a brand, like Colgate. What would you like?"" 
Colgate did not respond to a request for comment. Clorox declined to comment. 
As Amazon goes deeper with Alexa, it will likely be attempting to combine the popularity of the voice-powered devices with its wealth of consumer data to create more targeted opportunities for brand advertisers.
A spokesperson for Amazon said the company has no plans to add advertisements to Alexa.
Voice and artificial intelligence represent a new frontier for consumer giants, who are adjusting to non-visual formats. Consumer brands are expert at promoting their products in stores by manipulating packaging and shelving, and they're effective with commercials and traditional web ads, where they have screen space to showcase their products. 
Now that people are shopping by voice without browsing, advertisers have to find new ways of getting in front of them. 
""In these early days, artificial intelligence doesn't appear to recognize brand value, and it doesn't articulate it,"" said Greg Stemler, Ernst & Young's U.S. consumer products and retail leader for transaction advisory services. ""It may be a real challenge for branded consumer packaged goods companies to readjust.""
 'New brick and mortar'
 They don't have much of a choice. The number of people in the U.S. using voice-enabled speakers more than doubled in 2017 to 36 million, with Amazon capturing 71 percent of the market, according to a prediction from eMarketer. The Alexa app recently topped the Apple App store, and Amazon said it sold ""tens of millions"" of Alexa devices over the holidays.
Amazon is ""the new brick and mortar,"" said Matt Borchard, media director at ad agency Noble People. For brands, ""just like they need to spend money for placement in-store, they need to spend money for placement on Amazon.""
Still, voice represents a new medium with unpredictable results. Radio-style commercials don't work for most of the ways that people use the devices, and newer types of ads have hit early speed bumps. In June, a start-up called VoiceLabs, which was trying to help developers monetize their Alexa apps with ads, shut down after Amazon changed its policies to restrict promotions in Alexa skills.
In 2017, Procter & Gamble slashed up to $140 million in digital advertising spend, which the company deemed to be ineffective. 
In Alexa's current narrow use of advertising, it allows skills such as streaming music, radio, podcast or flash briefings to have ads, as long as the voice doesn't sound like or refer to Alexa. For example, CNBC announced recently that it will begin selling sponsorship opportunities on its skill. Ads can also be used in skills that help customers order products. If a person asks to order pizza, Alexa may indicate what deals are available. 
""We have to come up with the right monetization opportunity,"" said Doug Rozen, chief digital and innovation officer at media agency OMD. ""But it can't get in the way of what we are trying to use these devices for.""

 Gene Munster: Amazon will buy Target in 2018   
 11:27  AM ET Tue,  2 Jan 2018 |  00:53 
 Amazon may make a bigger move into physical stores this year, according to one analyst.
 Loup Ventures' Gene Munster is predicting the internet e-commerce company will buy Target in 2018.
""Amazon believes the future of retail is a mix of mostly online and some offline. Target is the ideal offline partner for Amazon for two reasons, shared demographic and manageable but comprehensive store count,"" Munster wrote in a post on Monday. ""As for the demographic, Target's focus on mom[s] is central to Amazon's approach to win wallet share.""
 Munster was an influential technology analyst with Piper Jaffray for 21 years before co-founding venture capital firm Loup at the start of last year. 
Munster said Amazon has ""aggressively pursued"" the family market with promotions for kid-friendly video content. In addition, an acquisition of Target will increase the company's store count to roughly 2,300 stores, which will allow it to compete with Walmart's nearly 12,000 store footprint, according to the analyst.
Amazon closed its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market in August.
""As for retail stores, Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods 470 stores along with testing of the Amazon Go retail concept is evidence that Amazon see[s] the future of retail as a combination of mostly online and some offline,"" he wrote.
Amazon shares rose 56 percent in 2017 versus Target stock's 10 percent decline. 
Target shares rose 3.7 percent Tuesday. Amazon and Target declined to comment for this story.

Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison
 Amazon and Salesforce have long searched for alternatives to Oracle's technology — and now, the pair have made ""significant progress"" toward that goal, unnamed sources told The Information in a report published on Tuesday.
 Salesforce is developing its own alternative to Oracle's database, while Amazon is moving toward open-source technology called NoSQL, sources told The Information. If Amazon and Salesforce could move away from Oracle, it could be proof that other big businesses could, too, one consultant told The Information.
Oracle's database technology, as well as the coding language Java, have been the market standard in many industries since at least the 1990s, as one of the first databases to support ""http"" technologies online.
 But as more businesses have looked to move their data onto the cloud, Amazon's Web Services have emerged as the most popular option. While Amazon has long had gripes with Oracle, the growing rivalry between the two companies — as well as anti-AWS salvos from Oracle boss Larry Ellison — have added fuel to the fire, according to The Information. 
Salesforce, too, has been the target of attacks from Oracle. The two companies openly sparred over the past two years over which one would be first to reach $10 billion in enterprise software cloud sales.
Oracle declined to comment. Amazon and Salesforce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.
 Amazon said on Tuesday that more consumers paid for Amazon Prime benefits in 2017 than any prior year.
 But the company still has not revealed just how many members use the subscription services. Amazon did reveal that 5 billion items were shipped to Prime customers.
The announcement comes on the heels of a blockbuster year for the e-commerce company.  Amazon posted its best ""Prime Day,"" Cyber Monday and holiday season ever in 2017, with sales growing 60 percent year over year on Prime Day, and app-based sales up 50 percent year over year on Cyber Monday.
 Amazon added on Tuesday that Dec. 30 was the biggest streaming day for the company's burgeoning content business, as Amazon's sales of smart Alexa speakers have boomed.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has long said that loyalty and repeat purchases were a key part of Amazon's business, and over time, Prime programs have expanded to include Fresh food delivery, Pantry household supplies, Twitch game streaming and free books under Prime Reading.  Some Prime members also got new discounts in 2017 thanks to Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods.
Here's Amazon's full release.

Jeff Bezos, Amazon
 Amazon's push into new advertising products will not threaten Google's search business, analysts at Mizuho said in a note on Tuesday. 
 CNBC reported in December that the U.S. e-commerce giant is experimenting with various advertising products across its portfolio and off of its website. This includes e-commerce search and video products too. 
Sources also told CNBC this week that Amazon is in talks with large companies about letting them promote products on the Echo smart speaker devices via the voice assistant Alexa. 
 The news shows how Amazon is gearing up for a big year of advertising. 
Amazon currently has three main types of ad products. The first is sponsored product ads which appear when you search for an item on Amazon. The second is headline search ads which also display in search results at the top of the page. And the final one is a standard product display ad paid for by a company. 
Mizuho said it hosted an investor call with Merkle RKG, a marketing and data platform. Based on Merkle's studies, Mizuho said search appears to be the ""biggest opportunity"" in advertising for Amazon ""given its scale and the potential to increase pricing."" 
But the investment bank said that Amazon's advertising technology is still in its ""early development stage so it is well behind that of Google."" For example, Mizuho said Amazon's customer targeting products are not up to scratch yet and therefore monetization is harder. 
""That said, we believe that Amazon has plenty of headroom to improve its performance and monetization,"" Mizuho analyst James Lee wrote in the note.

 5:08  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018 |  00:55 
 Amazon's advertising push puts it in competition with the likes of Google and Facebook, both of which currently dominate the digital ad space. In the U.S., Google and Facebook are expected to rake in 63.1 percent of digital ad investment in 2017, according to eMarketer. In a report from March, eMarketer also forecast that Google's share of the search ad market could grow to more than 80 percent by 2019. 
And Mizuho said that Amazon is unlikely to threaten the search business for Google.
""We do not expect the emergence of Amazon's ad business to threaten Google's search business. Merkle is seeing very little overlap between Amazon's ad customers and Google's. In addition, the use case for Amazon and Google's search is very different,"" Lee wrote in the note. 
The investment bank said it maintains its ""buy"" rating on Amazon's stock with a price target of $1,300, which if realized, would represent a 9.3 percent rise from Tuesday's close.

An employee walks over a logo at an Amazon.com fulfillment center.
 Have you ever fretted over buying a suit or dress online for a wedding or another flashy event, wondering how it would look on your frame or if it would even fit? That might not be a problem soon now that Amazon has  patented a blended-reality mirror that lets you try on clothes virtually while placing you into a virtual location (via  GeekWire).
The patent describes the mirror as partially-reflective and partially-transmissive, and uses a mix of displays, cameras, and projectors to create the blended image. The imagined mirror works by scanning the environment to generate a virtual model, and then identifies the face and eyes of the user to determine which objects are to be seen as a reflection. Once this process is completed, the virtual clothes and scene are transmitted through the mirror to create the blended-reality result.

 Not all patented ideas turn into products, of course. But Amazon acquired Body Labs last year, an AI-software and computer vision company that once touted its ability to create 3D models of human bodies in motion and then dress them in virtual outfits. You can also draw a line of progression between the blended-reality mirror and  Amazon's Echo Look, a hands-free video camera that takes floor-length photos of you to provide style advice and fashion recommendations.
Amazon has increasingly  eyed a place in the fashion industry, ambitiously building up businesses in the sector, including launching its  own clothing lines and  developing algorithms that design clothing based on Instagram fashion trends. All considered, an Amazon-branded mirror that helps you get dressed isn't as bizarre as it might have once seemed.

 There's no denying that Amazon's retail business had an impressive 2017 and there's still plenty of room for the company to grow in certain categories this year.
 The internet giant was responsible for about 44 percent of all U.S. e-commerce sales last year, or about 4 percent of the country's total retail sales figure, according to One Click Retail, an e-commerce analytics provider.
""Every major trend we see across 2017 can be explained by the fact that more of Amazon's core demographic (millennials) are growing up: they're increasingly owning homes, raising children, and buying a TON of stuff to go with it,"" One Click Retail CEO Spencer Millerberg wrote in an annual review of Amazon.
 To be sure, he added: ""This raises the question: will this create long-term changes and tailwinds for Amazon? Will 300-ish Whole Foods stores be enough to compete meaningfully in the brick-and-mortar space against Walmart's 4000+ stores?""
One Click Retail found the fastest-growing product groups on Amazon.com in 2017 were luxury beauty (up 47 percent from a year ago), pantry items (up 38 percent), grocery (up 33 percent) and furniture (up 33 percent).
 The most sales last year on Amazon.com — more than $8 billion — stemmed from the company's consumer electronics division, which includes laptops, headphones and other computer components. Home and kitchen, publishing (which includes books) and sports and outdoors were other top-grossing categories.
 In 2017, Amazon worked to quietly build out an automated marketing system that caters to the brands that sell on its website (taking market share from the likes of Google and Facebook). It also rolled out additional private-label lines across numerous retail categories and took its voice-enabled platform, Alexa, to new highs.
Millerberg said 2018 should bring more of the same, as Amazon gets more ambitious with its private labels, experiments with Alexa, grows with Whole Foods and lures new shoppers to its Prime membership base.
""Ultimately, success — for both Amazon itself and for brands that sell through the platform — comes down to knowing your audience,"" he wrote. ""It's clear that Amazon catered to the right crowd in 2017.""
Amazon didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on One Click Retail's data.
At the end of December, One Click Retail said Amazon's private-label brands by themselves had almost $450 million in sales in 2017, with the majority of those sales stemming from AmazonBasics, which sells items such as batteries and computer cables.
""This year, Amazon's private brands showed enough success stories to guarantee that Amazon won't be backing off any time soon,"" Millerberg explained at the time.

 Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper: Here's what makes Colorado the best place for Amazon HQ2   
 1:46  PM ET Wed,  3 Jan 2018 |  05:00 
 The governor of Colorado sees a unique selling point in Denver's bid for Amazon's second headquarters: the same ""can-do"" western attitude as the e-commerce giant. 
 ""Look at how Denver and Colorado have recreated ourselves in the last 10 or 15 years as the most pro-business state in America,"" Governor John Hickenlooper told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" Wednesday. 
Hickenlooper, for his part, founded a Denver-based brewery and is considered a pro-business Democrat. But his state's bid for a new Amazon headquarters is comparatively light on tax incentives. 
 ""We're never going to offer $7 billion of incentives,"" Hickenlooper said, referencing a high-priced bid from New Jersey. 
""This is one of the most desired locations for young professionals in America,"" he said. ""And over the long term, that's going to be much more powerful — whether [Amazon gets] a puny billion dollars here or billion dollars there.""
Hickenlooper touted the state's universities, engineering talent and commitment to the environment — just a few of the positive factors that bumped Denver to a C+ grade on CNBC's report card. 
The commonly cited drawbacks — crumbling infrastructure, chief among them — are actively seeing improvement, he said.

 Amazon sees a future in offline retail which is why Target is a perfect fit: Gene Munster   
 7:37  PM ET Wed,  3 Jan 2018 |  05:01 
 Loup Ventures' Gene Munster is predicting the internet e-commerce company will buy Target in 2018. Industry sources aren't so sure. 
 Certainly, Target's stock has swooned over the past year, and sources suggest it may need to do something transformative to address its challenges. It is the ""lost child"" of retailers, with no clear core competency (though a strong home and apparel business). It is unclear that a sale to Amazon though is in its future. 
As a starting point, it is important to keep in mind that Amazon is prudent in its acquisitions and does not do many large-scale ones. Acquiring Target would be its largest deal yet. When Amazon does a big deal, it is looking for explicit capacities it lacks in areas it has already found challenging.  
 When Amazon bought Whole Foods, it had been studying, investing and struggling to manage  the business of fresh food for a long time prior. Whole Foods gave Amazon a strong brand name in the fresh food industry, expertise in managing foods and distribution centers for that food.
It similarly can be said for Amazon's $847 million acquisition of Zappos, which followed Amazon's unsuccessful dalliance with selling shoes and accessories through Endless.com. At the time of the Zappos deal, Endless was receiving 777,000 visitors a month according to Comscore, while Zappos got 4.5 million visitors, the New York Times then reported. 
The question Amazon therefore faces in evaluating a Target deal are: 1) How much does Target offer that Amazon can't already do on its own; 2) Does Amazon need whatever Target does offer so badly that it justifies a purchase of a company with a market capitalization of $36 billion.
Here are the considerations: 
 Target's business is a mishmash
 Target is a little bit of this, a little bit of that — its roughly $70 billion in sales are scattered nearly equally across its various businesses.  
In 2016, household essentials (pharmacy, beauty, etc.) generated 22 percent of its sales; food generated 22 percent; apparel and accessories generated 20 percent; furnishings and decor generated 19 percent and hardlines (electronics, sporting goods, etc.) generated 17 percent of its sales. 
Many of these businesses, particularly household essentials, home and hardlines, are areas in which Amazon already excels (it might, though, benefit from Target's furniture sales). It is therefore not clear that adding Target's hold on the those businesses would do much more than cannibalize Amazon's own sales. 
Food, meanwhile, is an area in which Target has struggled. Not to mention, Amazon already has a foothold into the space through its Whole Food's acquisition. 
Apparel might be the one channel in which Target, at this moment, surpasses Amazon. It is also an industry Amazon seems to care about: It has invested in private label brands, launched a try- before-you-buy service and even patented a mirror that dresses you in virtual clothes.
Target has been largely successful in its clothing business, particularly in its private label ventures. Its Cat & Jack brand crossed the $2 billion mark a year after its launch. Target plans to launch at least 12 more brands on the heels of its success.
But part of Target's private label success has come from its focus away from selling third-party brands as a means of driving people into its stores and off of Amazon. Amazon, meanwhile, has been courting brands to sell on its website, including Nike.
Further, while Target has had success with private label, it is not clear that Amazon could not (or is not) successfully doing private label apparel on its own.  
 Target's footprint is vast
 It is unclear that Amazon needs to add Target's 1,834 stores. Target owns, not leases, the majority of its real estate. If Amazon buys Target, it also acquires its unproductive or less profitable stores and would be stuck managing them. Target, meanwhile, has been focusing on shifting its retail strategy, focusing on smaller and more productive stores in more urban locations.
Should Amazon buy a retailer for its real estate, a more natural (and cheaper) choice might be Bed Bath & Beyond. A number of its leases are due to go up in the next couple of years, making it easier to roll off less attractive real estate.
Amazon, like many other e-commerce companies, is increasingly appreciating the importance of brick and mortar. Stores help lower the cost of returns, shipping and marketing.
But Amazon's real estate plays so far have been very specific. Its Whole Foods acquisition helped it solve the unique problem of delivering fresh food, which requires infrastructure. It also signed a partnership with Kohl's last year, allowing shoppers to return items to Amazon from Kohl's stores.
Not to mention, Amazon also already has roughly 322 distribution points, according to MWPVL International, a logistics consulting service. 
 Integrating would be a challenge
 Amazon has certainly flirted with big box retailers, including its partnership with Kohl's. But partnering with a big box retailer and owning one are very different. In buying a big box retailer, Amazon also buys the headaches that come with it. 
One of the biggest challenges of marrying the two is managing inventory and returns. Amazon has trained shoppers to become used to the ""extended aisle"" of online shopping — an endless assortment of products that are not sold in stores. Returns of these items for traditional retailers have become complicated and costly.
Stores can be left with ""orphan products"" — a random sweater they have no way to display, because a store doesn't typically sell it. Finding the sweater's way back home to a distribution center is also expensive. This seemingly minuscule problem can build up over time. 
Not to mention, consumer spending on apparel is dropping.

An attendee operates the new Amazon Echo device.
 Amazon Echo owners are Amazon's most loyal and frequent shoppers, according to a new report by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.
 The report says Amazon Echo owners spend an average of $1,700 a year on Amazon, more than the $1,300 Amazon Prime members are estimated to be spending a year on the e-commerce site. That's 66 percent more than the average spend by all Amazon customers, the report said.
""We've long thought that Amazon is keenly focused on building increasingly loyal and frequent shopping customers, and Echo seems to promote that goal,"" CIRP's co-founder Josh Lowitz said in the report.
 The results, based on a survey of 2,000 U.S. shoppers in the 12-month period ended September 2017, partly explains why Amazon is so focused on expanding its Echo user base. The e-commerce giant has been offering steep discounts for its Echo devices and has come up with an array of product options targeting different needs, including an Echo device with a screen.
Amazon has never disclosed the exact sales figure for the Echo devices. This week, the company announced that it sold ""millions"" of Amazon devices and that the Echo Dot device was the best-selling product among Prime members. During the holidays, Amazon dropped the price of the Echo Dot to as little as $29.
""Based on the spending patterns of Echo owners, Amazon can certainly subsidize sales its Echo devices,"" Lowitz said in the report.

Satya Nadella speaking at the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 Microsoft, Amazon, and Google said they are working on updates to cloud services and other products to prevent exploitation of chip-level security vulnerabilities.
 The vulnerabilities, which were publicly disclosed by the Register on Tuesday, could allow a hacker to steal information stored in the memory of a wide range of computer chips running on personal devices, like computers, as well as servers in data centers, including those used to run cloud computing services. It could allow a hacker to steal information stored in the memory of the chip itself, including things such as passwords and cached files. It could also pave the way for attackers to weaken other security features.
One of the vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown, is known to affect Intel chips. Another, Spectre, could affect chips from many vendors. Indeed, Arm said that some processors based on its technology are affected.
 ""We're aware of this industry-wide issue and have been working closely with chip manufacturers to develop and test mitigations to protect our customers,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. ""We are in the process of deploying mitigations to cloud services and have also released security updates to protect Windows customers against vulnerabilities affecting supported hardware chips from Intel, Arm, and AMD.""
In addition to patching its cloud services and current and older versions of Windows for servers and desktops, Microsoft has updated its Edge and Internet Explorer browsers. Updates for Microsoft Surface devices are coming as well.
Google was the company to first alert Intel to the vulnerability, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on CNBC earlier on Wednesday.
Subsequently Google released some details about the issues but said a full report is still to come. A new site discussing the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities credits Google's Jann Horn and third-party researchers with discovering them.
Google said it has updated its public cloud service to prevent attacks related to Meltdown and Spectre. ""We used our VM Live Migration technology to perform the updates with no user impact, no forced maintenance windows and no required restarts,"" Google engineering vice president Ben Treynor Sloss wrote in a blog post. But customers will still need to update the operating systems they use on the Google cloud.
Google has also been busy checking on consumer services. Exploitation is ""difficult and limited"" for most Android devices, and the latest version of Chrome OS is patched, Google said.
Amazon told customers of its Amazon Web Services cloud service that the vulnerability ""has existed for more than 20 years in modern processor architectures like Intel, AMD, and ARM across servers, desktops, and mobile devices."" It said that it's already protected nearly all AWS instances, although customers will still have to patch the operating systems they use. 
In the CNBC interview Krzanich said he was not aware of exploits of the issue, and Microsoft has not gotten any indication that the vulnerabilities ""had been used to attack our customers,"" the spokesperson said.
Aside from security concerns, the Register and some individuals suggested that patches to operating systems could result in performance slowdowns. But in a statement on Wednesday, Intel said that ""any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.""
Microsoft told customers of its Azure public cloud in a blog post that they ""should not see a noticeable performance impact.""
VMware has come out with patches for its desktop and server virtualization software.
Linux distribution vendor Red Hat is working on making product updates available to customers. ""Red Hat is taking a proactive position that favors security over performance, while allowing users the flexibility to assess their own environment and make appropriate tradeoffs through selectively enabling and disabling the various mitigations,"" the company said on a website devoted to the vulnerabilities.
Some Red Hat patches are live, and more will be coming in the next few days, a spokesperson told CNBC in an email.

 Roku is getting in on the smart voice assistant market.
 Roku said Wednesday that it will launch a voice assistant that will allow users of existing Roku players and TVs to control the devices by voice.
The company said its third-party partners will build new speakers and other audio systems that can link right into the Roku Connect ecosystem. It will enable Roku owners to speak simple commands, such as ""play classical music in the kitchen,"" for example. TCL, one partner, will unveil its first Roku voice assistant product during the CES gadget show in Las Vegas next week, Roku said.
 Roku didn't provide any additional examples as to what users might be able to do with voice controls. Google Home and Amazon Echo products allow users to play music, control their TVs, check the weather, ask trivia questions and more.
Amazon and Google also offer streaming sticks, the Chromecast and the Fire TV Stick, respectively, which compete directly with some of Roku's products. Voice controls may help it play a bit of catch-up in the space.
A software update that includes the new features is set to arrive this fall, Roku said.

79,2018-01-04,Amazon Alexa will soon control microwave ovens  Here are some companies Amazon could acquire instead of Target: Analyst  ,"Shannon Stapleton | Reuters
Jeff Bezos
 You'll soon be able to use Amazon Alexa to start heating food in your microwave.
 Amazon introduced new tools on Thursday that allow kitchen appliance makers to build Alexa, the voice assistant that powers Echo devices, into microwaves and eventually conventional ovens. You might, for example, tell Alexa to set the microwave for 3 minutes or ask Alexa to preheat the oven to 300 degrees.
The functions won't work with existing microwaves and ovens, so manufacturers will have to build new smart ovens to support Alexa.
 Whirlpool has signed on to launch an Alexa-ready microwave that will be the first to the market. GE, Kenmore, LG and Samsung will also sell new products with Alexa.
Alexa is already built into other smart appliances, including LG refrigerators. Google and Apple have yet to announce similar features for Google Assistant or Siri.

Premier League match between Tottenham Hotspur West Ham United.
 Amazon has held talks regarding U.K. rights to stream Premier League soccer matches ahead of a rights auction next month, according to a report by The  Daily Telegraph.
 The tech giant has spoken with industry experts about the requirements of broadcasting live games as it lacks experience in the space, the newspaper said, citing two sources.
The last auction for rights to air live Premier League matches brought in £5.1 billion ($6.9 billion) from British telecommunications firms Sky and BT. Early moves from Amazon will likely fuel speculation of a challenge to the two companies.
 The e-commerce titan, currently worth almost $583 billion, beat out the likes of Twitter to score a $50 million deal to live-stream NFL matches last year.
Amazon declined to comment on the report, saying it does not comment on ""rumors and speculation.""

Jeff Bezos speaking at the new New York Economic Club luncheon in New York on Oct. 27, 2016.
 It will be another great year for Amazon shareholders, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Citi Research reiterated its buy rating for the internet giant's shares, predicting Amazon will generate strong growth.
""We remain bullish on the consumer Internet sector, especially near term considering that a positive, tax reform fueled, business climate should benefit the end-markets of the companies we cover,"" analyst Mark May wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""Amazon moves up a spot to become our top-ranked pick as we see the combination of >30% topline growth, margin expansion, and 20x '19 FCF as a compelling mix.""
 May increased his price target for Amazon shares to $1,400 from $1,250, representing 16 percent upside to Thursday's close.
The analyst predicts Amazon will be able to raise its operating profit margin to nearly 10 percent in three years from the current 6 percent level due to growth in its Amazon Web Services and advertising businesses.
""In 2018 we expect continued expansion in newer categories (e.g., healthcare/pharma) and moves to integrate Whole Foods into the core Prime offering,"" he wrote.
Amazon shares rose 56 percent in 2017 versus the S&P 500's 19 percent gain.
The company's shares are up 0.5 percent in Friday's premarket session after the report.

 Amazon just released an Alexa Mobile Accessory Kit   
 1:40  PM ET Fri,  5 Jan 2018 |  00:48 
 Amazon announced new tools on Friday that will allow gadget-makers to include the smart voice assistant in a whole array of new products.
 Alexa is Amazon's smart voice assistant, and it has slowly made its way from the Amazon Echo into third-party speakers, refrigerators and, soon, even microwaves. Now, with Amazon's Alexa Mobile Accessory Kit, device makers will be able to build Alexa into headphones, smartwatches, fitness trackers and more.
That means you may soon be able to look down at your wrist and ask Alexa the weather or to remind you to pick up eggs at the grocery store.
 Some firms have already started to build smart voice assistants into products. Bose's new QC35 II headphones have Google Assistant built in, for example, and the Apple Watch has long offered support for Siri.
Amazon said Bose, Jabra, iHome, Beyerdynamic and Linkplay plan to bring Alexa to products this year.

The Echo Plus looks great around the house
 People do actually want to use their smart speakers to shop. 
 Newly published research from Google and Peerless found that 62 percent of smart speaker owners surveyed said they were likely to buy something through their speaker in the next month. 
That's good news for both Google and Amazon — which so steeply discounted their smart speaker products over the holidays that they each likely lost a few dollars on every unit sold. The solution to that could come through sponsored shopping.  
 As CNBC reported earlier this week, Amazon has big plans for bringing sponsored products ads to Alexa in 2018, allowing brands to promote their products in shopping searches or recommend them if a user asks their Echo a related question, like the best way to clean up a spill. Google, which currently allows Home users to buy products through its shopping service, Express, obviously has a lot of experience with paid product searches, too. 
The survey, which was conducted this fall among 1,642 U.S. monthly active voice-activated speaker owners, also asked what kinds of information people would be willing to get from companies. It found that 52 percent of people wanted information about deals, sales and promotions, 48 percent would like personalized tips, 42 percent would be open to getting info about upcoming events and activities, 39 percent would like store locations and hours, and 38 percent wanted access to customer service.
As more people start shopping through the Google and Amazon speakers now blinking in their kitchens, living rooms or bedrooms, both companies will be trying to figure out the best way to monetize their new voice-activated format. 
Meanwhile, some users see their Echo or Home as more than just a piece of hardware: 41 percent of people said that communicating with their speaker feels like talking to a friend or another person. 
Also included in the survey, here are the top reasons people said that they use their smart speakers:
 It allows me to more easily multitask. It enables me to do things faster than other devices. It empowers me to instantly get answers and information. It makes my daily routine easier.

Whirlpool's Scan-to-Cook technology
 Whirlpool has said Apple Watch wearers will soon be able to remotely control their home appliances.
 It would mean smart watch owners could change temperature settings on ovens, delay cycles on washers or check how long is left to run on a dryer.
The manufacturer announced the development at the CES tech show in Las Vegas Monday and said it's the first time that an appliance maker has connected its products with the Apple Watch.
 Compatibility with Apple Watch will begin with a roll out to more than 20 of Whirlpool's connected appliances this year.
The new technology heralds another stage in the rapid development of connected white-ware. Last week Amazon announced that you would soon be able to control your microwave oven from its smart assistant, Alexa.
Whirlpool said Monday that will be a reality this year, stating that families will be able to control its 2018 range of appliances with voice commands to both Amazon's Alexa and Google's home assistant.

 In a separate press release, also published Monday, Whirlpool said consumers will also soon be able to connect smart appliances to Honeywell's line of thermostats.
Those capabilities will allow consumers to set their appliance to ""away mode"" when their phone or Apple Watch detects that the homeowner has gone out.
One example would be setting a dishwasher to only start its washing cycle once a person was a certain distance away from the property and outside a ""geo-fence"". The company added that managing the temperature of the home could also be set to sync with appliance cycles.
Brett Dibkey, Whirlpool Corporation vice president of brand strategy in North America, said the new technology would ""take the guesswork out"" of domestic energy management.
Whirlpool Corporation claims to be the leading appliance manufacturer in the world, with approximately $21 billion in annual sales.

 Amazon is taking its popular Alexa voice control system offline — to your car.
 On Monday, Amazon introduced Alexa Onboard technology, which lets users access the Alexa voice assistant through their car's infotainment system. That means drivers or passengers can play music, ask for directions or get other information simply by speaking to the car's audio system.
Panasonic, one of the first partners for Alexa Onboard, made the announcement at CES. The new system also makes certain Alexa services available offline, allowing people in the car to interact with Alexa even when there's no network connection.
 ""Enabling some of these capabilities even without an Internet connection is revolutionary,"" Tom Gebhardt, president of Panasonic Corporation of North America, said in a statement.
 Tweet
 Amazon has been aggressively pushing Alexa to be available in third-party products, all with the goal of making its popular voice assistant available ""everywhere,"" including automobiles.
Amazon has already partnered with Ford and Hyundai for in-car availability.
But the partnership with Panasonic is important because it gives Amazon another channel into the auto market. Panasonic is the market leader in the vehicle infotainment space, with an 11.5 percent market share, according to a 2016 report by Strategy Analytics. Another study, by Research and Markets, estimates in-car infotainment will grow into a $30 billion market by 2022.

 Merck CEO: We continue to work with Trump Administration to try and do what's good for patients   
 5:48  PM ET Mon,  8 Jan 2018 |  04:26 
 The CEO of drug giant Merck said Monday that not enough of the rebates being negotiated for medications are being passed on to consumers.
 ""Rebates being paid by pharmaceutical companies, it's about a third of what branded [drug] companies actually have as a list price,"" Merck's chief Ken Frazier told CNBC at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference.
""A third of that goes into the distribution system through insurance companies, PBMs [pharmacy benefit managers] and others through rebates,"" Frazier said.
 ""I think what's really broken, if you want to call it that, [is] that those rebates are not passed on to consumers,"" Frazier said, echoing a line that a number of drugmakers have been making.
""We think what we really have to do is get some of those rebates, which are the product of intense negotiations with the supply chain, on to the people who need it at the pharmacy counter.""
Pharmacy benefit managers, which oversee drug insurance plans for customers, have pushed back against the idea that they are primarily to blame for rising prices, as opposed to the makers of the medications themselves.
Frazier's comments on rebates came as he was asked about the possibility of mega-online vendor Amazon entering the drug-delivery business.
""If that's a more efficient way of getting drugs to patients, we would be in favor of it,"" Frazier said.
Drugmakers such as Merck have faced criticism in recent years for raising prices of their products. President Donald Trump, in particular, has on occasion blasted drug companies for their prices.
Frazier resigned last summer from Trump's manufacturing council in protest of the president's equivocal response to the racist-fueled violence during demonstrations in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer.
Trump quickly lashed out at Frazier, accusing Merck of having ""ripoff"" prices.
 Tweet
 On Monday, Frazier was asked by CNBC if he was surprised or insulted by the president's comments.
""I can't say I was surprised,"" Frazier answered. ""I made my statement; the president made his statement in response.""
Frazier said Merck continues to work with the administration and Congress and credited Trump for being ""focused on American business, competitiveness, jobs.""
Asked why prices for Merck's medications have to be raised every year, Frazier defended the practice by saying the price hikes are ""modest, so to speak, in the low- to mid-single digits.""
""What we've tried to do is ... make sure we have the right balance between the kind of return we need on investment in order to continue to invest in research and make sure drugs are still affordable,"" Frazier said.
He said he expected there to be continued attention this year on the issue of rising drug prices, both by the Trump administration and by Congress.
""The good news, from everything I sense, [is that] people want to do that in a way that's actually consistent with supporting innovation,"" Frazier said.
He also said that to address the issue of rising drug costs, he opposed ""price controls and things of that nature, which have been discredited and discarded in the past.""
""I think anything that supports a market-based approach to that is a good approach,"" said Frazier, specifically citing a push by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the head of the Food and Drug Administration, to speed up the approval process for generic drugs.
Frazier said the recent tax bill passed by Congress and signed by Trump ""will allow us to compete on an even basis with our ... competitors.""
He said he does not expect the effects of the bill to change how Merck allocates its capital.
""We're going to continue to spend money on the science as we've always done, and we're going to build plants where we have an opportunity to do that, and we're going to hire people [as] our business expands,"" he said.
Even before the tax bill, Frazier said, ""We had enough power in our balance sheet and enough financial flexibility in terms of our ability to access capital so that we could do the kinds of deals that Merck wants to do.""

 Amazon is just getting started in the e-commerce and retail business, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Piper Jaffray reiterated its overweight rating on the internet company's shares, predicting Amazon will generate strong sales growth this year.
""Amazon, despite its size and continued strong growth, is arguably still in the early innings of its share gain potential, even in the company's most penetrated market,"" analyst Michael Olson wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""Most domestic internet users have a significant opportunity to increase their Amazon holiday wallet share allocation.""
 Olson increased his price target for Amazon shares to $1,400 from $1,200, representing 12 percent upside to Monday's close.
Piper Jaffray's survey of 1,000 U.S. internet users revealed that 50 percent of people allocated 10 percent or less of their holiday spending to Amazon. As a result, he estimated that the company had 4 percent market share of U.S. retail holiday spending in 2017.
""Considering the U.S. is Amazon's most penetrated market, we see this low-to-mid single digit market share as a significant positive,"" he wrote.
Olson forecasts Amazon will generate 28 percent sales growth in 2018. 
Amazon shares rose 56 percent in 2017 versus the S&P 500's 19 percent gain.
The company's shares were up about 0.40 percent in early Tuesday trading after the report.

 });Jeff Bezos' wealth hit a high of $105.1 billion on Monday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, surpassing Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates' previous record of $100 billion in 1999, reports CNBC.
 Bezos' wealth peaked as Amazon stock prices have climbed on the back of strong holiday shopping performance.
Some have called Bezos the richest man in history, but according to CNBC's Robert Frank, Russian President Vladimir Putin is likely richer (though there's no way to track his wealth). And if adjusted for inflation, Gates' $100 billion fortune in 1999 would be worth about $147 billion today.
 Still, of those individuals whose wealth is publicly traceable, Bezos is the richest person alive. As of Tuesday, Bezos' net worth is $104.5 billion, according to Forbes.
And the self-made fortune is impressive. Bezos hasn't always been the billionaire titan he is today. He was born the son of a 16-year-old mom and deadbeat dad. And he didn't set out to be the CEO of an e-commerce juggernaut.

Jeff Bezos
 ""I won the lottery with my mom. Thanks for literally everything, Mom""
 Jeff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen. His biological dad, Ted Jorgensen, met and started dating his mother, Jacklyn Gise, when they were both in high school. Jorgensen was 18 and Gise was 16 when she became pregnant. They flew to Mexico with their parents' money to get married.
Jorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn't have much money. He was also ""had a habit of drinking too much,"" according to ""The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,"" by journalist and biographer Brad Stone. When Jeff Bezos was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen. 
In 1968, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos, who arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba knowing only one word of English: ""hamburger."" Jorgensen agreed to let Bezos adopt his son and, at 4 years old, Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.
Biographer Stone suggests that Bezos' childhood may have contributed to his obsession with success. ""It is of course unknowable whether the unusual circumstances of his birth helped to create that fecund entrepreneurial mix of intelligence, ambition, and a relentless need to prove himself. Two other technology icons, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, were adopted, and the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed,"" Stone writes.

 Growing up, Bezos spent summers with his grandparents on their Texas ranch,  he says in the commencement speech he gave at Princeton in 2010. ""I helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores. We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially 'Days of our Lives,'"" says Bezos.
Bezos would also occasionally get to road trip with his grandparents.
""My grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada. And every few summers, we'd join the caravan,"" Bezos says in graduation speech. ""We'd hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather's car, and off we'd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips.""
 Launching Amazon: ""I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice""
 Bezos got straight As in high school, was the valedictorian of his class and was accepted early admission to Princeton, according to Stone's biography. For a time in college, he thought he would be a theoretical physicist.
But it was years later, while working in finance in New York City that he had the idea to start Amazon.
""I came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I'd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles — something that simply couldn't exist in the physical world — was very exciting to me,"" says Bezos, in his 2010 Princeton address.
At the time, Bezos was just 30 and had been married for a year. ""I told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn't work since most startups don't, and I wasn't sure what would happen after that,"" he says. 
 ""After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.""
-Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, Blue Origin
 His wife told him to go for it.
""As a young boy, I'd been a garage inventor. I'd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings,"" he says. ""I'd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.""
But not everyone was on board. Bezos boss took a walk through Central Park and told Bezos that, while it sounded like a ""really good idea,"" it would be an even better idea for somebody who didn't already have a good career.
""That logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision,"" says Bezos. ""Seen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn't think I'd regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all.
""After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I'm proud of that choice.""
 The early days of Amazon: ""I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift""
 When Amazon first started, it sold only books. Bezos would drive the packages to the post office himself in his 1987 Chevy Blazer. ""I thought maybe one day we would be able to afford a forklift,"" Bezos tells Charlie Rose in a wide-ranging interview in 2016. ""And it is very, it's very, very different today.""
After books, the next items Bezos added to Amazon were music and videos. Then, he asked customers to see what else they would want to buy from the online retailer.
""I sent an email message out to the customer base, actually a thousand randomly selected customers, and I said, besides books, music and video, what would you like to see us sell? And the list came back incredibly long,"" explains Bezos.  
""It was basically just whatever the person had on their mind right now,"" says Bezos, and that sparked an idea.

 Here's what makes up the Jeff Bezos empire   
 12:48  PM ET Thu, 29 June 2017 |  01:05 
 ""One of customers said, 'I wish you sold windshield wipers because I need windshield wipers for my car.' A light kind of went on in my head. You know, people — people will want to use this new fangled e-commerce way of shopping for everything,"" Bezos says to Rose.
""People are very convenience-motivated,"" says Bezos. ""So that really started the kind of the expansion into all categories, consumer electronics, and then apparel, and so on.""
Expand he did. Today, Amazon sells almost everything. From toilet paper to groceries to electronics to fashion to furniture.
When Bezos enters a new product category, he is not intimidated by a lack of expertise.
""I am never disappointed when we're not good at something because I think, well think how good it's going to work when we are good at it,"" Bezos tells Rose. ""And the apparel is like that. There is so much opportunity. Nobody really knows how to do a great job of offering — apparel online yet. And we have tons of invention and ideas and working our way through that experimental list.""
 Amazon's North star: ""Customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession""
 Bezos has always been a rare combination of optimistic, idealistic and visionary.
Back in 2003, while much of the tech industry was still hungover from the dot-com bust, Bezos was aggressively foretelling the potential of the Internet. ""I do think there's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us,"" says Bezos in a TED Talk he gave that year. ""We're very, very early.""

}
 As Bezos charged full force into the Wild West that was the Internet then, he was — and still is today — guided by a single belief: Do what is best for the customer.
""Thing that connects everything that Amazon does is the number one — our number one conviction and idea and philosophy and principle which is customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession. And so we are always focused on the customer, working backwards from the customer's needs, developing new skills internally so that we can satisfy what we perceive to be future customer needs,"" Bezos tells Rose.
Another through line to Bezos' business strategy is his ""willingness to think long-term,"" he says.
""We are very happy to invest in new initiatives that are very risky, for five to seven years, which most companies won't do that,"" Bezos tells Rose. ""It's the combination of the risk-taking and the long-term outlook that make Amazon, not unique, but special in a smaller crowd.""
Finally, he's obsessive about finding problems and fixing them.
""Taking real pride in operational excellence, so just doing things well, finding defects and working backwards — that is all the incremental improvement that in business, most successful companies are very good at this one. ... [Y]ou don't want to ever let defects flow downstream,"" Bezos says to Rose. ""That is a key part of doing a good job in any business in my opinion.""

 The evolution of Jeff Bezos: See if you can recognize him through the years   
 3:57  PM ET Tue, 18 July 2017 |  00:51 
 From e-commerce to media
 As consumer behavior on the web has evolved, so, too has Amazon. Prime, the e-commerce's popular two-day shipping membership comes with access to premium television shows, for example.
Being a content creator built on the back of an e-commerce giant gives Amazon freedom to be creative. For example, one of Amazon's most popular shows, ""Transparent,"" is about a patriarch who becomes a woman later in life. It's won eight Emmys and been nominated for another 28.
""A show like 'Transparent' which has won Golden Globes and Emmys is not ever — it is not a show that could be successfully done on broadcast TV, because broadcast TV needs a much bigger audience,"" says Bezos to Rose. ""And so you can actually think about the creative process a little differently. You can attract different storytellers. You can go for stories that are narrower but incredibly powerful and well told.""
In addition to producing online shows, Bezos is also the owner of another kind of content: journalism. Through his Nash Holdings LLC, he bought the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million. 
""I bought it because it's important,"" says Bezos. ""I would never buy a financially upside down salty snack food company. You know, that doesn't make any sense to me. But The Washington Post is important. And so it makes sense to me to take something like that, and I also am optimistic. And I thought there were some ways to make it — I want it to be a self-sustaining, profitable enterprise,"" Bezos says to Rose. ""And I think it can be done.""
Bezos' empire now stretches far and wide. Amazon, which currently has a market cap of more than $500 billion, bought Whole Foods in August and also owns companies like Zappos and Twitch. Through Bezos Expeditions, he's also invested in companies like Twitter and Basecamp, among many others.   
 The final frontier: ""I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5""
 While shipping toiletries and downloading books has made Bezos wealthy, his passion is outer space.
 Buzz Aldrin dropped by Blue Origin HQ to say hi to the team yesterday.
 ""This is a childhood dream,"" Bezos says to Rose. ""I fell in love with the idea of space and space exploration and space travel when I was 5 years old. I watched Neil Armstrong step onto the moon. You don't choose your passions, your passions choose you. So I am infected with this idea. I couldn't ever stop thinking about space. I have been thinking about it ever since then.""
To that end, Bezos is the founder of Blue Origin, a company that aims to make space tourism affordable. 
""Basically what I am doing right now is taking my Amazon winnings and investing them. Every time you see me sell stock on Amazon, it's send more money to the Blue Origin team,"" Bezos says to Rose.
In addition to making it possible for more people to travel to space, Bezos says he is building the infrastructure for the next generation of space entrepreneurs.
""[I]f I'm 80 years old, looking back on my life and the one thing I have done is make it so that there is this gigantic entrepreneurial explosion in space for the next generation,"" says Bezos, ""I will be a happy, happy man.""

A Toyota Motor Corp. Lexus LC 500h hybrid vehicle stands on display during the press day of the Seoul Motor Show in Goyang, South Korea, on Thursday, March 30, 2017.
 Toyota said Tuesday it will introduce Alexa, Amazon's cloud-based voice assistant, in some Toyota and Lexus vehicles in 2018. 
 The feature will be available in all Toyota and Lexus cars that have the Toyota Entune 3.0 App Suite and Lexus Enform App Suite 2.0 in 2018. 
The company will add the feature to additional models in 2019. Toyota announced the news at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.
 ""This makes Toyota and Lexus vehicles among the first to bring the convenience of Alexa into the car and onto the road,"" said Zack Hicks, senior vice president and chief information officer at Toyota Motor North America and CEO of Toyota Connected.
Customers will be able to access Alexa's range of skills — as its voice applications are called  — while in the car. So apart from asking it some of the usual things, such as playing music or giving a weather report, passengers can also use the service to interact with smart-home devices to turn lights on in their homes or open their garage doors. Users can also ask it to identify nearby businesses in the middle of a trip and offer directions to them. 
The service will also enable new features in the cars themselves, such the ability to start the engine remotely or lock the car doors, by giving a command through another Alexa device in the home or elsewhere.

 Physical stores critical: Kohl's CEO   
 7:35  PM ET Tue,  9 Jan 2018 |  01:01 
 As major retail chains continue to close stores nationwide, Kohl's Chairman, President and CEO Kevin Mansell told CNBC that his company's success actually stems from its physical locations.
 ""Physical presence is important in people's mindset as they think about where to shop,"" Mansell told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Tuesday. ""Regardless of whether they shop in the store or online, if you have a physical presence, you're top of mind. So having a physical presence is critical.""
Speaking from ICR's annual investment conference, Mansell doubled down on the bull case for brick-and-mortar, emphasizing the need for retailers to serve ""a more omni-channel consumer.""
 ""We're not in malls,"" the CEO said. ""Ninety-five percent of our stores are off-mall, and they're mostly single-level, free-standing, easy to get in, easy to get out.""
Mansell said the strategy ties back to Kohl's three original ""pillars:"" brands, value and convenience.
New initiatives related to improving the customer experience and promoting personalization — both part of Kohl's ""Greatness Agenda"" — will update the strategy as the consumer evolves, he said.
While the CEO wouldn't comment on whether Kohl's unique partnership with Amazon will eventually result in the e-commerce giant acquiring Kohl's, he did speak to its benefits.
""We're focused on any ideas, however far-out they may seem to somebody outside our business, that would essentially drive more people into our stores,"" Mansell said. ""Amazon's a great company [with] amazing customer engagement.""
With consumer sentiment on the rise, engaging customers has become a central focus for Kohl's. Amazon's support, however contradictory, furthers that mission, the CEO said.
""Values are really important to them, but the customer experience is what's critical,"" Mansell told Cramer. ""Those are shared values with Kohl's, and so our thinking in the Amazon pilot is, really, how do we translate their success into more traffic coming into Kohl's stores?""
An Amazon spokesperson declined CNBC's request for comment.

Walmart planning to offer delivery straight to your fridge.
 You'll soon have the option to request a package be delivered inside your home, or fresh groceries be stocked in your fridge, when you're not around. You'll just need an August Smart Lock.
 San Francisco-based August Home has partnered with same-day delivery service Deliv to safely open shoppers' front doors to retailers, merging August Home's access platform with Deliv's client base, which includes such companies as Macy's, meal-kit service Plated, Kohl's, Best Buy and Walgreens.
These are just a few of the retailers, along with other logistics services outside of Deliv, that could reveal partnerships with August Home in the next few months, August Home CEO Jason Johnson told CNBC.
 In 2017, Walmart teamed up with the smart-lock maker to pilot this shipment method around Silicon Valley, which was largely successful, Johnson said. The big-box retailer is expected to make an announcement later this year regarding its progress and the next steps to tackle in-home (and in-fridge) delivery.
""We're opening up this platform to all retailers,"" Johnson said. ""And every company has a different spin — one [retailer] wants to put packages inside your door, and another wants to get rid of boxes altogether.""
Now, shoppers across the U.S. ordering online from those companies that work with Deliv will have the option through their smart locks for in-home delivery. Once a delivery is approved, one of Deliv's employees will be given a one-time access code to that smart lock to step inside the customer's home and drop off packages.
Soon, August Home's in-home delivery platform August Access will be available on other locks, such as Yale residential and commercial locks.
Johnson said his goals are to grow trust with consumers, to make them feel more comfortable with in-home delivery, and to bring retailers big and small across the country onto the platform.
The big theme in retail this year is home delivery, Johnson told CNBC, ""and the companies that you trust should have access ... in a safe and secure way. We've been working on this for a few years now.""
Internet giant Amazon, which started an in-home delivery service in November, has been in talks to ship packages to a car's trunk. 
As retailers search for solutions to unattended package deliveries that could attract ""porch pirates,"" many consumers are still wary of giving companies full access to their homes, despite the benefits an in-home drop off might offer.
Smart doorbell maker Ring has created a platform for homeowners to monitor their front porches, and Mail Haven makes smart mailboxes to protect packages.
As retailers launch with August Home and Deliv, consumers are going to have a range of delivery options and services ""to make it as broadly appealing as possible,"" Johnson said. ""We want every retailer to have the opportunity to participate in this.""

Amazon.com chief technology officer Werner Vogels
 Amazon's aggressive poaching tactics in Israel have the country's start-up community riled up, causing some companies to explore abandoning Amazon's cloud service in retaliation.
 Shai Wininger, the co-founder of Lemonade, an insurance start-up that's raised $180 million, took his frustration to social media, writing multiple posts on LinkedIn and Facebook about Amazon's poaching activity.
""Just learned that Amazon is actively targeting and trying to poach Lemonade Inc. employees,"" Wininger wrote on LinkedIn. ""I wonder if that's their idea of supporting the start-up ecosystem. Reconsidering Amazon AWS."" 
 Wininger later followed up, saying Amazon's poaching of employees from customers, like Lemonade, is a ""breach of confidence."" He also added the ""obscene amount of money"" being offered to steal his employees could end up damaging the entire Israeli start-up market.
In a separate Facebook post, Wininger wrote, ""Game on! Werner Vogels FYI,"" tagging  Vogels, Amazon's chief technology officer.
Wininger's complaint is the latest evidence of the growing tension between Amazon and emerging tech companies. Last year, Amazon irked some start-ups after releasing a product that looked and worked almost the same as a device made by Nucleus, one of its Alexa Fund portfolio companies. It could also cripple Amazon's effort to expand its presence in Israel, a start-up powerhouse with some of the world's best technical talent.
As Wininger's posts gained traction, Vogels eventually left a comment underneath it, indicating he doesn't support Amazon's poaching from its customers.
""Let me dive into this,"" Vogels wrote in the comments section of the Facebook post. ""It may be a sourcing agency vs Amazon proper. I find that sourcing from our customers would be extremely counter-effective."" 
 Talent war
 Amir Konigsberg, CEO of the Tel Aviv-based start-up Twiggle, said the problem isn't necessarily about Amazon stealing start-up employees, but rather the aggressive nature of its poaching. 
He pointed out that Amazon has been ""systematically"" reaching out to groups of employees working on specific projects within start-ups, putting them at risk of losing an entire team at once. Konigsberg, who formerly led Google's expansion in Israel, said Amazon is much more aggressive than other multinational companies, like Google or Facebook.
""Talent war is fine but you have to remain respectful,"" Konigsberg said, adding Amazon is hurting its relationship with the rest of the Israeli tech community.

 Target is plotting a big move away from AWS as Amazon takes over retail   
 6:31  PM ET Tue, 29 Aug 2017 |  00:58 
 The bigger problem for Amazon is that it may be hurting itself.
In the comments section under Wininger's post, a number of Israeli start-up CEOs said they're considering other cloud vendors because of Amazon's actions. That would add to the flood of companies avoiding AWS, a group that includes a number of big-box retailers like Walmart, Target, and Kroger.
""We spend nearly $2,000,000 / year on AWS, yet Amazon recruiters are aggressively trying to poach our developers in TLV,"" wrote Liad Agmon, CEO of Tel Aviv-based Dynamic Yield. ""It's a data point I'm seriously considering as part of our internal debate whether to stick with Amazon or switch to Google cloud.""
When reached for comment, Amazon said it doesn't recruit by targeting employees from a specific company or customer.
""We have many open positions around the world and recruit talent based on job-related skills and expertise, not the current employer,"" Amazon said in a statement.
""While we have employees that leave Amazon for other companies and vice versa, ‎we haven't built the type of customer base we have by specifically targeting our customers' employees for hire – we focus our attention on helping our customers create great businesses on AWS.""
Given Amazon's massive share in the cloud space, it's hard to imagine this will have a material impact on AWS. But it's at least opening the doors for competitors to reach out with better offers, as one Google Cloud salesperson did on LinkedIn.
""Google Cloud would love to have you — shoot me a message,"" the Google representative wrote under Wininger's post.

 });It seems too good to be true that you could make millions by raiding the clearance aisle at your local Walmart or Target and then selling your haul on Amazon. But that's exactly what 29-year-old Ryan Grant is doing.
 Only four years after quitting his accounting job in Minneapolis to flip purchases full-time, his business has made over seven figures in lifetime profits, which have been heavily reinvested in the company.
""Pretty early on I realized I wasn't in the career path that I wanted to be on,"" he tells CNBC Make It. ""That experience really had me looking for other options and I was starting to explore ways that I could basically leave that job and have my own schedule and be on my own time.""
 To do that, Grant turned to the side hustle he had used to made ends meet in college. But an early mistake made him realize that, to make big money, he'd have to get smarter with what, and how, he was selling. 
 Ryan Grant
Ryan Grant spent 30 hours a week searching Walmart and other local retailers for products that he could flip on Amazon.
 As a student at Winona State University, he organized textbook buyback events on campus twice a year. He listed the books on Amazon and shipped them out to customers around the country for a profit of up to $10,000 a year.

 });
 ""Going through that process for one semester was enough to know that I didn't want to do it again,"" he says. ""From there forward I did Fulfillment by Amazon the rest of the way.""
Using Amazon's fulfillment services meant he could ship all the books in bulk using preferred UPS rates to an Amazon warehouse, where, for a fee, the online retailer handled processing and shipping out each individual order. And, when Grant grew more unfulfilled at his accounting job, it sparked the idea of going online to flip more than just textbooks.
 Ryan Grant
Grant scans items using InventoryLab's Scoutify 2 app (left) which reveals detailed sales data for a given product on Amazon.
 After work and on the weekends, he scoped out the clearance aisles at Walmart, scanned a few items using Amazon's app and bought up toys, games, and home improvement items he realized he could re-sell for a profit. A receipt from his early days shows a variety of purchases, everything from vacuums to Barbies, LEGO sets to stainless steel flatware.
""I was putting in about 10 hours per week and I was making in the ballpark of $1,000 per month,"" he recalls. Once he was able to make the same kind of money reselling on Amazon as he had made at his accounting job, in September 2013, he quit.
Profits swelled to $9,000 a month just three months later and continued to grow for the following year and a half until a fateful purchasing decision landed Grant in trouble in 2015.
 Ryan Grant
Coming across a product worth flipping on Amazon meant buying out the store.
 He bought 750 units of a nail filing tool for dogs called ""Peticure Power"" in a liquidation sale and sent them to Amazon. When some customers started returning products they ran into issues with, the higher return rate flagged his account and resulted in a two-day suspension. 
""I was stuck with probably around $2,000 of dead inventory,"" Grant recalls, adding that he lost an additional $6,000 in potential profit during the suspension. ""That was probably the biggest mistake that I made. ... From there on, I always made sure that any supplier that I'm buying from, the goods are 100 percent legitimate and I can get the invoices to prove it.""         
Eventually he got better at targeting more reputable items that represented the best opportunity for arbitrage. Seasonality, Grant realized, was a key factor. He could, for example, buy up discounted candy after Halloween and half-priced Christmas decorations around the New Year.
 Ryan Grant
When Ryan Grant's kitchen was overflowing with boxes he was shipping to Amazon, he made the call to rent a warehouse.
 ""Believe it or not, there's actually people buying those items out of season,"" Grant laughs.
Still, even he was surprised at how quickly the business took off. ""I went from just me in this business doing around $3-5,000 in sales per month and now, four years later, we're a team of 11 and we're doing well over $200,000 in sales per month,"" Grant says. The team had to move to a warehouse that's over five times as large as their first this past July.
Since he started selling on Amazon, Grant says the business has topped $9 million in total sales. Profits are heavily reinvested back into the company, though Grant was still able to take a salary of around $150,000 when he was working on the venture full time.  
 Ryan Grant
After outgrowing his first warehouse, Grant's business expanded to a 3,800-square-foot office.
 As his business is increasingly run by his team, Grant has reduced his salary down to $60,000 a year and now dedicates much of his time to teaching the ways of e-commerce. He consults and teaches classes through the same blog he has been using to track his performance. His hope is that he might be able to help a few people who might not be happy at their jobs find the same independence he did, and avoid the same mistakes he made early on.
""I was just looking to have freedom of schedule and replace the income that I had from that job and now it's turned into a lot more than that,"" he says. ""I mean, I would be sitting in an office cubicle now or working at a client location as opposed to doing what I want to do effectively when I want to do it.""

 Amazon may reach the $1 trillion market value milestone as it dominates new growth markets, according to a top Wall Street firm.
 J.P. Morgan reiterated its overweight rating for Amazon shares, predicting strong growth for its internet advertising business.
""We believe Amazon has the potential to be a $1 trillion dollar company over time, as it remains early in the eCommerce & cloud secular shifts and in our view Amazon is investing in more major growth opportunities than any other company we cover,"" analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.

 Anmuth raised his price target for Amazon shares to $1,385 from $1,375. The new target is 11 percent higher than Tuesday's closing price.
The analyst noted that the company only has 10 percent share of the U.S. online advertising market compared to its 42 percent share of e-commerce sales. Facebook and Google dominate the global online ad market outside of China, the note said.
""We believe advertisers and agencies would welcome a third scaled digital player,"" he wrote. ""Amazon is best positioned in our view, with its in-market customers, scale, strong access to data, shopping history, ability to close the loop, & leading market share in smart home speakers with Alexa/Echo.""
As a result, Anmuth predicts Amazon's ad business will generate sales growth of more than 60 percent this year.

 Trump repeats call for internet tax, making a veiled threat against Amazon

 President Donald Trump repeated an earlier call for an internet tax, in a thinly veiled shot at Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post. 
 ""The internet — they're going to have to start paying sales tax because it's very unfair what's happening to our retailers all over the country that are put out of business,"" Trump said Wednesday.
Trump also reiterated concerns about Amazon's effect on the U.S. Postal Service as it struggles to keep up with online orders. 
 The comments mirror tweets from the president in December that named the e-commerce giant.

 President Trump slams Amazon, telling U.S. post office to charge more   
 11:21  AM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 |  02:48 
 There's been speculation that the president's shots at Amazon are aimed at Bezos, whose newspaper has published stories critical of the president.
Amazon already collects sales tax on products it sells directly to consumers, but has faced challenges from states over its policy of allowing third-party vendors to charge varying levels of sales tax. 
In June South Carolina filed a complaint against the online retailer, and Amazon agreed in November to take on additional third-party tax burden in its home state of Washington. 
The issue has garnered more attention as Amazon continues to take a bigger share of overall retail sales. Amazon celebrated its ""biggest holiday"" shopping season at the end of last year. 
There is an underlying movement among traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to more heavily tax Amazon, Ives said, so the discussion is ""something you have to keep an eye on."" 
But the likelihood that an internet tax would pass is small, he said.
""Listen they've [Amazon] significantly changed the retail landscape across the world,"" Ives said. ""I think it's more of the same where they're getting in the crosshairs."" 
Trump spoke before media and members of the administration Wednesday evening during the signing of the Interdict Act, which seeks to reduce drug smuggling through the purchase of opioid sensors. 
Amazon did not immediately return a CNBC request for comment.

 Breaking down Amazon's patent strategy   
 11:53  AM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  01:42 
 Amazon has about 500 patents pending. Of course, not all of them will form the basis of products, but Amazon has had some very notable patents -- like one-click shopping and many of the technologies that make up the foundation of cloud computing, now its most profitable business.
 So we looked at some recent patent issues to get into the head of Bezos -- and see if we could find some clues about the inventions and technologies Amazon might be looking at next.
With the help of MCAM, a analytics firm that measures companies intellectual property we looked at a few patents issued over the last month. Some of them could be straight out of Black Mirror, the Netflix series that explores a high-tech near future. And when you look at activity overall, some themes emerge. MCAM analysis reveals that Amazon is ramping up patent activity in video, connected home and AR technologies.
 Augmented reality mirror
 In December, Amazon was issued patents that include an augmented reality mirror and a ""smart"" sensor-studded package delivery air vehicle, as well as patents that include technology that would ""mute"" the Echo's video mode by pixelization for user privacy and detect hacked self driving cars.
As Amazon moves deeper into the fashion world, an augmented reality mirror would bring that world into customers' homes. It allows users to try on virtual clothes in a virtual setting, using a system of cameras, mirrors, projectors and lights to project different backgrounds and clothes onto the user.
Amazon's Echo Look camera is already halfway there -- letting users take a picture with the help of Amazon's Alexa AI voice assistant, and use that to virtually try on different outfits. The company may be looking for ways to blend the Echo Look technology with its other recent fashion forays, like its own clothing, handbag and shoe labels and its Stitch Fix-like at-home clothing trial service.
 Also in December, Amazon filed a patent for technology that would detect hacked self-driving cars. While Amazon has never said they are getting into autonomous driving, the patent could be hugely important for bigger players in this space like Tesla, Alphabet and Uber.
 Another notable patent issued in the last month could advance video technology in Amazon's Echo devices. The technology allows users to use video conferencing on their Echo and mute it by blurring or pixelating the video for user privacy. This one suggests that Amazon is thinking of privacy protections as it ramps up video communication.
 A strong history of patents
 While many of Amazon's thousands of patents may never come to fruition, experts say that Amazon has very notable successes in terms of developing and protecting core patented technology.
For example, long before cloud computing was a mainstream enterprise practice -- and long before Google or Microsoft entered the space -- Amazon was getting patents issued relating to advanced cloud management and deployment.
""That strategy very much empowered their business strategy to allow them to have a huge lead in cloud,"" says David Pratt, Managing Director at MCAM. ""In turn,"" he says, ""it made it more complex and costly for competitors to stand up their cloud capability."" Amazon's cloud unit, AWS, is now the company's most profitable business.
Amazon's patent for one-click shopping, which lets customers buy things without entering and re-entering their billing, payment or shipping information, was issued in 1999. That patent gave it an edge over other retailers and reaped dividends through licensing fees from the likes of Apple and others. It expired last year, but for nearly 20 years, Amazon was the only game in town for a technology many consumers now take for granted. 
Gaston Kroub, a founding partner at IP litigation boutique Kroub, Silbersher & Kolmykov, says that Amazon ""struck gold"" with one-click by getting a seminal ecommerce patent. With cloud computing, he says Amazon got in early ""in what proved to be a very important business unit and that gave them a competitive advantage.
To date Amazon has over 6,100 patents issued by the U.S., Europe and World Intellectual Property Organization. But in the business of patents, experts say it's not about numbers, but having the best quality patents that aim to enable and extend a company's business model. And in that regard, Pratt says, Amazon has one of the richest patent portfolios among the Fortune 500.
Kroub says that while Bezos has been proactive and smart about getting patents, part of his success comes from the era in which the company grew up.
""It helped that Amazon came of age at a time when there was a real land rush to patent technologies around software and business practices,"" Kroub says. ""During the dotcom boom, there was a huge rush in the patent office to grab as many as possible. Amazon was part of that wave and developed good habits on the patent front.""

 Make money with 'this time it's different'   
 6:49  PM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  00:51 
 Back in the day, CNBC's Jim Cramer would always hear that the four most dangerous words in the English language were ""this time it's different.""
 And when it came to market-rattling events like the dotcom bubble burst — when investors chased internet stocks to artificial highs hoping to catch the ""next big thing"" — that idea usually proved right.
""But honestly, I've now been at this business a pretty long time, and I'm beginning to wonder if the four most dangerous words about stock investing are 'this time it's the same,'"" the ""Mad Money"" host said on Friday.
 After watching big-cap tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet drive the market to new heights, Cramer argued that a ""this-time-it's-different"" mentality could've cost investors fortunes if they had applied it to the FANG names.
Investors would've kicked themselves if they were so shaken by the dotcom bubble that they avoided getting in on the Harvard-born craze that became the $521 billion Facebook, he said.
""You really had to believe this time it's different if you were going to buy some shares in some online retailer where you gave them your credit card information and actually trusted that they'd send you [product] overnight,"" Cramer said. ""But Amazon did become a $629 billion profitable company.""
""This time it's different"" would've made you rich if you believed in a money-losing company that rented out DVDs, because that company became the $95 billion giant that is Netflix, Cramer said.
""This time it's the same"" would've kept you from investing in a website that provides information based on anything you type, yet another dotcom name that eventually became Alphabet, the $782 billion parent of Google.
""The graybeards missed all of these stories because of their old saw,"" Cramer said. ""It stopped them from taking what turned out to be a calculated gamble on four companies that would have made fortunes for those who believed things really would be different this time.""

Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon
 Amazon will continue to draw investor demand this year, despite making record-level investments, Morgan Stanley wrote in a note published Friday.
The investment bank didn't change its $1,250 price target for Amazon, but reiterated its prediction of $2,000 per share — or roughly a $1 trillion market cap — under its ""bull case"" scenario.
 It gave the three following reasons for its bullish position on Amazon:
 High margin revenue streams: Amazon's gross profit margins could significantly increase this year because of the growth in its high margin businesses — AWS, Prime subscriptions, and Advertising/other segments. More gross profit gives Amazon more flexibility to invest in its operations, which allows it to spend more in new areas like international, video, and Alexa. ""We believe continued strength in high margin revenue streams will start to outgrow investments in Video, salesforce, Alexa, and fulfillment centers,"" the note said. Continued strong top-line growth: The company's revenue growth has bounced back to mid-to-high 20 percent in the last two years from closer to 20 percent growth in 2015. That's largely driven by its Prime member growth, Echo device sales, and the broader consumer shift to online shopping. ""Investments will result in increased earnings and cashflow in out years and lead to positive estimate revisions,"" the note said. Growth in under-penetrated and large markets: Amazon will continue to move into new markets, as it did with the acquisition of Whole Foods last year that immediately made the company a major presence the in brick-and-mortar grocery market. ""We see Amazon's immediate addressable US market as $2.5 trillion, but this could expand to $5 trillion if it expands into more markets,"" the note said. 
Under its $2,000 per share ""bull case"" scenario, which would get Amazon to the $1 trillion market cap milestone, Morgan Stanley estimates the core retail business to be worth $600 billion and the AWS cloud $273 billion. It forecasts Amazon's advertising business to get to $55 billion, while its subscription business would become worth $69 billion.

Satya Nadella speaking at the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
 Amazon lost share in the public cloud business in the fourth quarter, while Microsoft continued to gain momentum, according to research from KeyBanc analysts.
 Amazon Web Services had 62 percent market share in the quarter, down from 68 percent a year earlier, KeyBanc's Brent Bracelin and other analysts wrote in a note on Thursday. Microsoft Azure jumped from 16 percent to 20 percent, and Google's share increased from 10 percent to 12 percent, they said.
According to KeyBanc, Azure likely contributed $3.7 billion to Microsoft's fiscal 2017 revenue, which totaled an estimated $96.6 billion. That suggests Azure almost doubled, which is consistent with Microsoft's disclosures about Azure's revenue growth in recent quarters. 
 Amazon, meanwhile, said that AWS grew 42 percent in the third quarter. 
The analysts expect Azure's revenue growth to slow in fiscal year 2018 to 88 percent.
The KeyBanc report compared the big three cloud providers' artificial intelligence tools and found that Microsoft ""has more pre-built models than other public cloud vendors"" and makes them available from more data centers around the world.
Citing Azure growth as well as Microsoft's opportunities in AI, the analysts raised Microsoft's 12-month price target from $94 to $106. The stock closed at $89.60 on Friday.
""After our conversations with leaders at Microsoft, we came away believing the majority of revenue will come from the surrounding infrastructure costs, rather than the monetization of specific AI services, due to the required intensive model training and ongoing inference,"" Bracelin and the other analysts wrote.

 Amazon to pop 23% this year to near $800 billion value on new advertising venture, analyst says   
 4:55  PM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  00:52 
 Amazon stock will add to its historic run in 2018 thanks to its booming advertising business, according to BMO Capital Markets.
 The firm raised its price target for Amazon to $1,600 from $1,200, the highest 12-month forecast on the e-commerce company of any brokerage on Wall Street. The target represents a 23 percent gain from Friday's close of $1,305.20.
""We believe the emergence of Amazon's advertising business can support both margin and multiple expansion and could be a greater catalyst for the shares if management shares more data points like it did for Amazon Web Services,"" BMO analyst Daniel Salmon wrote on Monday. ""The end result is greater confidence in the company's advertising opportunity and an increase in our estimates.""
 The analyst's new price target implies a market cap of $771 billion given the current level of common stock. Shares rose about 2 percent on Tuesday.
 Amazon's ascent in the retail world has been nearly 21 years in the making, but the e-commerce giant has been accruing market cap at a faster rate in recent years.
Five years ago, shares of Amazon traded at $272, climbing to $809 per share by January 2016. With its shares now trading around $1,325, the company is ranked fourth in the S&P 500 in terms of market cap, behind Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft.
Salmon noted that the company's sponsored product ads, headline search ads and product display ads present the company with an $18 billion revenue opportunity in the medium term. Amazon may also see a bump in revenue when it starts recording certain advertising fees as revenue, the analyst added.
Amazon has been dabbling in various advertising products across its portfolio in recent months, preparing for a larger move into the space this year. Conversations appeared to be focused on the company's search and video products, sources told CNBC. One source said Amazon is working with third-party mobile advertising firms like Kargo.
Ken Sena of Wells Fargo is now the second most bullish analyst on Wall Street on the stock with a $1,525 12-month target, according to FactSet. Three others have $1,500 price targets.
While the company's stock rose 60 percent in the past 12 months, nearly 12 percent of that gain has occurred in the new year alone. But despite the dramatic rise, Wall Street has remained largely positive on shares. Echoing Salmon's sentiment, Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson reiterated his buy rating last week.
""Amazon, despite its size and continued strong growth, is arguably still in the early innings of its share gain potential, even in the company's most penetrated market,"" Olson wrote on Jan. 9.
Olson increased his price target for Amazon shares to $1,400 from $1,200 last week.

 Amazon is hiring a health privacy expert for 'new initiative'   
 6:23  PM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  00:40 
 Amazon is looking to hire an expert in a set of health privacy regulations known as HIPAA, according to a new job listing. 
 The company is looking for a professional who can ""own and operate"" the security and compliance aspects of a new initiative. The person will also ensure that it meets HIPAA business associate agreement requirements, meaning Amazon intends to work with outside partners that manage personal health information. 
It is also hoping the new hire will provide a consultative resource for all health-care regulatory issues. 
 Amazon is the latest technology company, after Apple and Alphabet, to make moves in health care. As CNBC reported in spring 2017, the company strategized how it could carve out a slice of the multibillion-dollar pharmacy market. It also has a health-care team at Amazon.com in Seattle, known by many names including ""1492.""
One more immediate reason that Amazon might be looking for a health privacy expert is to augment its efforts to bring its Alexa voice assistant to health care.
The technology is not yet HIPAA compliant, which means developers aren't able to record patients' lab results or other types of health information in a clinical setting. 
Amazon Web Services' health lead acknowledged the gap in September at an event to promote Alexa in hospitals. ""While Alexa and Lex (the technology powering Alexa) are not HIPAA-eligible, this (challenge) has provided us an opportunity to envision what is possible,"" she said.
In the summer, Amazon hired Missy Krasner, herself an expert in health policy, who formerly ran Box's health care initiatives.

 Trading Nation: Amazon's amazing start to 2018   
 3:56  PM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  01:48 
 The wins just keep coming for Amazon.
 The e-commerce giant has risen every trading day so far this year and is on track for its 10th straight day in the green, its longest winning streak since mid-2013. Those gains have pushed Amazon to the highest level of its two decades as a public company.
This streak isn't over yet, according to two market watchers.
 ""They're just executing on every possible front which is incredibly unusual for such a large company,"" Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, said Friday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""
""Amazon is a monster and has multiple streams of possible income,"" he said.
Those revenue streams include Amazon Basics, advertisements through its search platform, its artificial intelligence program Alexa, and its new reputation as a creative powerhouse, said Schlossberg. Earlier this month, Amazon's streaming service won a Golden Globe for its latest series, ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.""
Max Wolff, chief economist of The Phoenix Group, agrees that Amazon has potential for more gains.
""In a melt-up market where people are buying a lot of quality names like it's going out of style , this one looks like it's got legs to go,"" said Wolff, joining Schlossberg on ""Trading Nation.""
Even in a market hitting new highs, Amazon has managed to outpace its peers. Since the beginning of the year, the stock has close to 13 percent, nearly triple the S&P 500's year-to-date gain. Amazon has also exceeded the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF's 5 percent rise and is the second best-performing FANG stock of the year, coming in behind Netflix.
There is some risk to Amazon's ascendancy this year that could be delivered directly from the White House, said Schlossberg. President Donald Trump has frequently targeted Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and the owner of The Washington Post. Among Trump's tweeted attacks, he has suggested levying an internet sales tax against Amazon and said that its cheap delivery prices are devastating the United States Postal Service.
""But policy by Twitter is not a risk you can handicap,"" Schlossberg added.
Wolff has a price target of $1,400 to $1,500 on Amazon shares, representing 7 percent to 15 percent upside to current levels. Schlossberg does not have a price target on Amazon shares.
Other analysts generally have a positive view of Amazon and its chance for growth. BMO Capital recently upped its price target to $1,600 from $1,200, the highest forecast among analyst firms. Of those surveyed by FactSet, more than 80 percent have a buy rating on the stock. The average target price of $1,343 a share represents 2.5 percent upside to current levels.

 Charts: Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix and Nvidia may pull back   
 7:39  PM ET Tue, 16 Jan 2018 |  01:21 
 As the bank- and health-care-led market rally pushed the Dow Jones industrial average above the 26,000 level for the first time ever, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to check in with tech.
 ""You always need to be thinking about when it might be time to do a little register-ringing,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""I don't want to scare you away from stocks. Just the opposite — like I said, I like stocks. But if you're going to be a responsible investor, you need to be at least considerate of whether it's a good idea to maybe be a little cautious.""
The stocks of Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix and Nvidia all made 52-week highs on Tuesday amid the surge, so Cramer enlisted technician Carolyn Boroden to determine if it was time for investors to take some profits off the table.
 Boroden, the brain behind FibonacciQueen.com and Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com, said that with the four stocks nearing her price targets, now is the time to get careful.
""Boroden's not saying these stocks have peaked, not by any means, but she does think it's time to be a little more cautious,"" Cramer said. ""Is there anything wrong with that? I don't think so.""
Boroden began with Amazon's weekly chart. Being the ""Fibonacci Queen,"" she uses Fibonacci ratios — a series of number patterns discovered by medieval mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci — to find the levels where a stock is most likely to change its trajectory.
 The stock of Amazon recently reached two key Fibonacci levels, which Boroden saw as a sign that it might pull back in the near future.
Beyond that, Amazon's rally ending in October 2016 lasted for $373.21, exactly the same amount, to the cent, as the following upswing.
With Amazon hovering around $408 a share, this rally has been longer in the tooth. But because the October 2016 rally was followed by a $137 decline and the following rally by a $151 decline, Boroden had reason to suspect a pullback.
""Of course, she's not saying these patterns will exactly repeat themselves, but Amazon has gotten extended here,"" Cramer said. ""It doesn't take a genius to realize that a pullback conceivably could be in the offing. Throw in the fact that Amazon's got a ceiling of resistance at $1,344 and you've got another reason, let's say, to play it safe.""
Netflix's stock also recently reached a Fibonacci price extension that tends to happen before a decline, Boroden said. Like Amazon, the stock's daily chart shows it making a familiar run toward its ceiling of resistance.
 ""Most of Netflix's recent runs have lasted for anywhere from 44 to 47 points,"" Cramer said. ""Given that the stock is now up 45 points in its current rally and is facing a tough ceiling of resistance in the mid-$220s, Boroden thinks this is another one where you might want to book a couple of profits ahead of a pullback.""
Alphabet's stock looked overextended to Boroden, too. But she also became cautious after analyzing its daily chart's Y-axis to find the dates when its trajectory could change.
 Using her signature methodology, Boroden discovered a series of Fibonacci timing cycles that started last week and lasted through Wednesday.
""So if the stock's going to take a break and pull back, there's a very good chance it will happen pretty darned soon,"" Cramer explained.
Finally, Boroden found the stock of Nvidia approaching a key Fibonacci extension level in its daily chart, similar to the others in its red-hot cohort.
 Despite being bullish on Nvidia's long-term prospects, Boroden noted the symmetry between the stock's recent $45 rally and its last $48 run, suggesting that it might soon lose some steam.
""Now, Boroden's not turning negative on these terrific stocks. She's just saying, 'Don't abandon ship, but recognize there could be some choppy waters ahead,'"" Cramer said. ""Bottom line is that even the best stocks in the hottest of bull markets ... need to take breathers every now and then when they're snorting. And the charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, suggest that you might want to get more cautious [in the] short term with Amazon, with Alphabet, with Netflix and with Nvidia, because all four seem ready for temporary pullbacks. What can I say? You're up huge if you own these. Would it really hurt you that badly if you took something off the table?""

 Amazon's new headquarters search down to these 20 cities   
 12:55  PM ET Thu, 18 Jan 2018 |  00:31 
 Amazon said Thursday it narrowed the list of potential sites for its second headquarters to 20 locations. 
 Amazon said it will spend $5 billion in the place where it builds its second headquarters and will employ 50,000 there. The company previously said it was looking at metropolitan areas with 1 million people and a stable, business-friendly environment.
The remaining 20 places are:
 Atlanta Austin, Texas Boston Chicago Columbus, Ohio Dallas Denver Indianapolis Los Angeles Miami Montgomery County, Md. Nashville, Tenn. Newark, N.J. New York City Northern Virginia Philadelphia Pittsburgh Raleigh, N.C. Toronto Washington, D.C. 
The e-commerce giant received 238 proposals from cities in North America, many with lofty tax incentives and unique offers directed at CEO Jeff Bezos. 
""Getting from 238 to 20 was very tough — all the proposals showed tremendous enthusiasm and creativity,"" Holly Sullivan, an executive with Amazon Public Policy, said in a statement. 
The 20 places that are moving on in the selection process will work with Amazon over the coming months to ""evaluate the feasibility of a future partnership,"" the company said. 
Amazon expects to make a final decision this year. 
An analysis by CNBC determined that the Charlotte/Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina best matched Amazon's criteria.
Among the cities that didn't make the cut was Detroit, one of the areas hit hardest by the Great Recession.

Detroit's proposal to Amazon was incredible and garnered positive attention for the city from all across the world. As a state we will continue to pursue these types of valuable opportunities for our talented workforce. We are a top 10 state and we will continue driving to be the best in the nation. There is no limit to what Michiganders can do, and this proposal demonstrated exactly how we can marshal our resources and collaborate. Throughout the process of putting together this bid, we learned our greatest strengths and identified areas where we can improve. Now we are even more ready for the next big prospect. Michigan's spirit is unstoppable, and so is our comeback. This won't set us back — we're accelerating to the next opportunity. We know it's out there.

 Cramer: Why Amazon's latest move is a sign to buy the stock   
 6:56  PM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 |  00:53 
 When a company like Amazon raises the prices for its service and nobody cares, CNBC's Jim Cramer sees a clear next move.
 ""When you see something like that, it's about as clear a buy signal as you are ever, ever, ever going to get,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said on Friday after Amazon upped the price of its monthly Prime membership rate by 18 percent.
The price boost — from $10.99 to $12.99 for full-paying members — will total $156 a year, a ""smart"" move considering Amazon's yearly membership rate of $99 will remain the same, Cramer said.
 ""It's basically a tax on people who only pay month-to-month,"" he said.
Better yet, Cramer expected no resistance ""whatsoever"" to the price increase thanks to the quality and value that Amazon's Prime service provides.
""I bet most people don't even notice the price hike,"" he said. ""That's why Amazon remains a go-to name for anyone who needs a high-growth stock to round out their portfolio.""
The same goes for Netflix, Cramer argued. Nobody cared or resisted when the streaming giant raised the price of its 4K plan, which offers higher quality content, to $13.99 a month.
""Given that I pay $24 for two seats in a movie theater — $24 for a couple of maybe lousy hours of entertainment, pre-popcorn-and-candy, by the way — I'm thrilled to shell out a little more than just half that to binge on quality homegrown programming ... for a whole month,"" Cramer said.
Customers of Costco, which boasts some of the biggest bargains on the market, also tend to overlook when the big-box retailer raises the price of its membership cards, Cramer noted.
Apple's cloud service revenues also fall into this category. If privately-held music app Spotify ever comes public, its subscription-based service likely will, too, he said.
""The next time you get hit with a price increase and it doesn't bother you one bit, you need to pay up for the stock of that company in question, maybe even the next day,"" the ""Mad Money"" host concluded. ""In every instance I just mentioned ... it's been worth it.""

 });Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has a staggering fortune: He's the richest man in the world, worth about $108 billion, according to Forbes.
 And he's been busy. Just in the last year, Amazon acquired Whole Foods, began allowing Amazon Prime members to watch its movies and TV shows on Apple TV, created a camera that can help you pick out nicer outfits, was granted patents for delivery drones with wings and legs and much more.
But back in 1994, when a 30-year-old, newly married Bezos quit his Wall Street job to start Amazon, the business was pretty simple. It sold books.
 ""When we opened our doors, we had 10 employees,"" Bezos tells technology blog GeekWire. ""I was driving the packages to the post office myself in my 1987 Chevy Blazer and dreaming one day that we might have a forklift.""
Only three years later, in 1997, Amazon went public and Bezos' wealth catapulted to over $12 billion, according to Bloomberg.

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 But you wouldn't have known it by the newly minted billionaire's car. Despite his windfall, Bezos swapped out his 1987 Chevy Blazer for only a modest upgrade — a Honda Accord. 
That's according to a profile CBS's Bob Simon did of Bezos in 1999 for ""60 Minutes,"" recently resurfaced by Geekwire, showing Bezos sporting khakis, a button-down and driving the car.
""What's with the Honda?"" Simon asks Bezos. 
After a laugh, Bezos, who according to The New York Times owned roughly $10 billion in Amazon stock in 1999, responds, ""This is a perfectly good car.""
During the interview, Simon also discovered Amazon's then-headquarters in Seattle shared a street address with pawn shop, a heroin-needle exchange and a ""porno parlor."" And inside, Bezos' desk was made out of a re-purposed wooden door and two-by-four pieces of wood. In fact, the entire company used desks made of doors as deliberate message, according to the Times.
Why so frugal?
""It's a symbol of spending money on things that matter to customers and not spending money on things that don't,"" Bezos explains to Simon.
By 2004, Amazon employees were still using door desks, notes Fast Company. And in 2013, Bezos was still driving a Honda, though a slightly bigger model, according to Brad Stone's book, ""The Everything Store.""
Today, Amazon has a $620 billion market cap and reported $43.7 billion in revenue during its third quarter in 2017 alone, a 34 percent increase from the same quarter in 2016.
Bezos has some bigger extravagances, like multiple homes, a private jet and Blue Origin. 
Yet ""frugality"" remains one of Amazon's core principles and the company sticks by Bezos' early mentality. Amazon even gives out an accolade called the ""Door Desk Award"" to employees who come up with ideas that save money. 
According to Amazon: ""Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention.""

People approaching Kohl's department store in Mount Kisco, New York.
 Kohl's is ""sleeping with the enemy"" and that's a good thing, according to Jefferies analyst Randal Konik. 
 It's no surprise Amazon has been dubbed the enemy of the retail world, stealing market share from traditional players. But some (including Nike and Sears) have decided it's better to work with the e-commerce giant than clash and compete. 
Last October, Kohl's started selling Amazon's smart home products and accepting the online retailer's returns at a handful of its U.S. stores. Since then, some people have made the case for Amazon outright acquiring Kohl's for its real estate and loyal customer base. 
 The partnership between the two is a ""win for both companies,"" Konik said Friday. ""We anticipate the pilot to roll out nationally and provide KSS stores with stronger traffic and is a nice added convenience for AMZN shoppers."" 
Jefferies raised its price target on Kohl's stock to $100 from $66. That represents a gain of more than 50 percent from Thursday's closing price of $64.85. 
Kohl's shares climbed around 3 percent Friday after the Jefferies report. 
Kohl's has been ramping up its own ship-from-store capabilities, investing more in its private labels and making a ""clear commitment"" to the athletic category by bringing in Under Armour merchandise, Konik said, all of which are helping to fuel sales. 
The company gets an added benefit from being located off-mall, where customer traffic is typically stronger, and Konik expects a further boost as peers like J.C. Penney and Macy's shutter stores. 
Meanwhile, the retailer is testing smaller store formats of about 35,000 square feet. In some instances, Kohl's plans to lease portions of its bigger boxes to other tenants — potentially grocers or convenience stores, Kohl's Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mansell recently told CNBC. 
A lower corporate tax rate is also expected to benefit the company and drive earnings higher, he said. Kohl's is set to report fourth-quarter earnings and full-year results on March 1, when the company will share more details on any impact from new tax legislation. 
Coming off a strong holiday season, where same-store sales jumped nearly 7 percent from the year prior, Mansell said more people were shopping Kohls.com and purchasing items across all categories. 
Kohl's shares have climbed more than 63 percent from a year ago.

 Amazon raises monthly Prime membership rate by $2   
 9:58  AM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 |  01:42 
 Amazon raising its monthly prime membership rate isn't a big deal because it's still cheap, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday.
 The Prime rate will rise by 18 percent to $12.99 per month from $10.99, according to Amazon's membership page. The discounted student monthly rate will also increase, but the cost of yearly memberships will stay the same at $99.
""Costco, Netflix, Amazon Prime. Three things I don't look at my bill,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street"" moments after the news. ""I don't care. It doesn't matter.""
 Cramer believes the bump in the rate by Amazon is a small price to pay to use a service that he says is adored worldwide.
Amazon's Prime service grants several perks for its users, including faster shipping and access to Amazon Video.
Late last year, Netflix raised the monthly price of its popular streaming plan by $1 to $11 a month.
""My Amazon bill, my Netflix bill. Raise it,"" said Cramer, host of CNBC's ""Mad Money."" ""Raise it because I love those services and so does the world.""
""This flows just right to the bottom line,"" he added.
Amazon issued a statement Friday that said in part, ""Prime provides an unparalleled combination of shipping, shopping and entertainment benefits"" adding ""we continue to invest in making Prime even more valuable for our members.""

Now, Amazon, one of the largest employers in the country, will also ban this controversial question.
 An Amazon spokesperson tells  BuzzFeed News, ""We think this is the right thing to do for our current and future employees.""
Policies like these are intended to address cycles of income inequality that can be perpetuated when compensation is based primarily on a candidate's salary history. For instance, a hiring manager may offer a candidate a lower salary than the job was intended to pay simply because they were paid less — or unfairly — in the past.

 Labor and employment lawyer Miriam Clark tells CNBC Make It, ""There's a cycle of gender pay inequity that's been going on for as many years as anyone's been measuring compensation by gender.""
 According to the Institute For Women's Policy Research, women on average are paid 20 percent less than their male counterparts performing the same job. It's  even worse for women of color. Latina women are paid 46 percent less than white men, and African-American women are paid 37 percent less.

 BuzzFeed News reports that on Tuesday, Amazon posted a message on an internal company message board that instructed hiring managers not to ask prospective hires about their salary history.
Amazon recruiters can no longer ""directly or indirectly ask candidates about their current or prior base pay, bonus, equity compensation, variable pay or benefits"" or ""use salary history information as a factor in determining whether or not to offer employment and what compensation to offer a candidate."" This includes information gathered from sites like LinkedIn Recruiter.

 Amazon's first employee shares what he learned from Jeff Bezos   
 12:18  PM ET Thu, 26 Jan 2017 |  00:53 
 The rule applies to candidates for all positions, including salaried employees and hourly workers. Amazon currently employs over 500,000 workers, many of whom are hourly workers in distribution centers and call centers.
The online retailer is not the first tech company to ban recruiters from asking this question. Facebook and Google also report that they've stopped asking about compensation history, but many other employers are not as restrained.
If you are asked this question in a state or city where it is illegal Merrick Rossein, lawyer and professor at the City University of New York School of Law, suggests that applicants say something like, ""Pardon me if I'm wrong, but it's my understanding that that question isn't legal here. However, I'm very interested in this job and would be happy to discuss compensation ranges and goals.""
If you live in an area where employers are legally permitted to ask this question you really only have two options: offer a general range or be completely transparent.

 Suzy Welch: Here's the best answer to 'What's your current salary?'

 Career coach Nicole Hill Orisich says that candidates should say something to the effect of, ""I'd love to talk about the value I bring to the table as well as the market value for this position. Based on my own research for someone with my skills in this industry, I believe my market rate is somewhere between X and Y. I would be happy with something in this range.""
Bestselling management author and CNBC contributor Suzy Welch suggests a different strategy.
""People are going to tell you that you should game this conversation. You should dodge this question by talking about ranges,"" she says. ""That is no way to start a relationship.""
Once you have done your research, know how much the position typically pays and understand how much you are really worth, Welch says candidates should be candid and what they make. Hopefully, the recruiter will return your honesty with respect.
""If your potential employer games you in this conversation, it's a warning sign,"" she says. ""Don't ignore it.""

Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy in an interview with CNBC's Jon Fortt at the 2017 AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas.
 Networking with health-care venture capitalists is now a full-time job.
 Amazon Web Services and Nvidia have job openings for folks who can network with health investors from the elite firms.
In Nvidia's case, that means funds like Venrock, which it specifically mentions. The AWS listing doesn't name-check any firms in its job listing, in favor of letting its future hire identify ""appropriate VCs to target."" 
 The idea behind these hires seems to be to build up relationships with investors and their portfolio companies, so they make an early decision to buy AI chips and services from Nvidia or AWS over others. Switching costs at a later stage in the companies' life cycle are labor-intensive and expensive. 
The idea isn't new: Big tech companies have been networking with VC firms and start-up accelerator programs for years. 
But the health-care angle is interesting because traditional tech firms haven't typically paid much attention to health.
""What's different today is that they (tech) recognize that health care is roughly a fifth of the GDP and they need a specific strategy to grow quickly in this sector,"" said Venkat Mocherla, who runs business development at Qventus, a health start-up that uses artificial intelligence tools to speed up hospital operations. 
 A.I. is hot
 Bringing AI tools to health care is a particularly hot area.
Nvidia's strategic business development lead for health care would work from the company's AI start-up program, which it describes as cultivating ""dedicated and extraordinary start-ups who are revolutionizing industries."" It's looking for a health-care expert with a strong grasp of the inner workings of pharma and health information systems.
Genomics companies are rich targets for big tech beause they generate a massive amount of data. For that reason, Alphabet has a team called Google Genomics dedicated to the space, and Amazon made a strategic investment in Grail, a company that mines genetic information for early signs of cancer.
Venrock health investor Bob Kocher said by phone that he is not shocked that companies are looking to network with his team. 
""It is certainly true that many large companies reach out to us to work with our portfolio companies and let us know why we should be early adopters,"" he said. Venrock has backed health companies ranging from Castlight to Juno Therapeutics.
Kocher said companies like Apple, Alphabet and Amazon are realizing that these companies have strong growth potential and are on the market for new technology tools.
""Health care is a data-intensive business,"" he said.
He also has some advice for applicants to these jobs.
""I like two pumps of vanilla in my latte,"" he joked.

Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square
 Payment company Square is ""analogous to Amazon or Google in their early days"" but Wall Street is valuing the stock all wrong, according to Nomura Instinet
 The firm reiterated its buy rating on the company's stock on Friday, calling big gains in 2018 as the company disrupts the payments industry.
The San Francisco-based company's climb to fame is a result of its financial transaction technology, enabling small businesses to accept card payments through its software and hardware products. It also developed Square Cash, a means of sending and receiving money between individuals and businesses akin to PayPal's Venmo.
 ""In 10 years, Square is likely to be a very different company helped by accelerating share gains from payment peers and relentless disruption of services like payroll and HR,"" analyst Dan Dolev wrote in a note to clients. Valuation should include ""mix shift to large sellers, accelerating share gains, growing penetration of higher priced transaction types like virtual terminal and e-commerce, as well as high margin services like Square Capital and payroll.""
In all, added Dolev, a surge in gross payment volume — a key industry metric — should help ensure Square has another ""phenomenal year.""
The analyst's $64 price target represents 59 percent upside from Thursday's close over the next year, the highest target on Wall Street according to FactSet data. Shares rallied 4.8 percent Friday morning.
Dolev believes his peers on Wall Street don't see this bright future for Square because they are using ""conventional valuation methodologies."" The analyst is using a discounted cash flow model to come up with his target.
Square shares are up 173 percent over the past 12 months. 
The company topped Wall Street expectations in its latest earnings report and CEO Jack Dorsey, who also leads social media site Twitter, told investors that Square's growth runway looks strong.
""As we continue to grow up-market, we've learned that more complex sellers often have established systems that they've tailored to their businesses, such as e-commerce websites, custom points of sale, or inventory software,"" he said during the earnings call. ""With our open platform, developers can connect these systems with Square and give sellers the ability to manage them in one place.""

 Amazon is raising its monthly Prime membership rate   
 12:51  PM ET Fri, 19 Jan 2018 |  00:48 
 Amazon is raising its monthly Prime membership rates 18 percent. 
The premium membership that grants faster shipping and access to Amazon Video will now cost $12.99 per month, up from $10.99, according to the company's membership page. 
Amazon is also increasing the discounted student monthly rate from $5.49 to $6.49 per month for new sign-ups.
 The cost of a yearly membership, $99, will not change. 
Recode first noticed the new price. 
Amazon started the monthly pricing model less than two years ago as a more flexible way of taking advantage of Prime's fast shipping and other benefits. Prime members spend considerably more on Amazon than non-Prime members. 
Amazon issued this statement Friday morning:
 ""Prime provides an unparalleled combination of shipping, shopping and entertainment benefits, and we continue to invest in making Prime even more valuable for our members. The number of items eligible for unlimited Free Two-Day Shipping increased in recent years from 20 million to more than 100 million items. We have expanded Prime Free Same-Day and Prime Free One-Day delivery to more than 8,000 cities and towns. We also continue to introduce new, popular and award-winning Prime Originals, like The Grand Tour, Sneaky Pete, and the Golden Globe-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel – all included with Prime Video. Members also enjoy a growing list of unique benefits like Prime Music, Prime Reading, exclusive products and much more.  We will keep introducing new ways to make members' lives even better."" 
The company doesn't disclose the number of Prime members in its earnings. Instead, the company shows revenue from ""subscription services,"" which includes Prime in the U.S. and overseas, as well as  subscriptions for things such as e-books and music. In the third quarter of 2017, subscription revenue grew 59 percent from the prior year, to $2.4 billion.
Research firm GBH Insights estimates 88 million people subscribe to Amazon Prime and expects only a 2 percent churn from the price hike as the more expensive monthly rate nudges users to an annual subscription, analyst Daniel Ives said. 
Morgan Stanley said in a note published in December that Amazon Prime growth is plateauing in the U.S., showing the first signs of a slowdown. It based its conclusion on a survey of 1,000 U.S. adults.
Amazon shares were up modestly midmorning Friday.

Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.
 Amazon has hired a top Seattle doctor in its latest push into health care, according to two people familiar with the matter.
 Martin Levine of Iora Health, which focuses on Medicare patients in six U.S. markets, is one of Amazon's most high-profile hires to date in health. It's not yet certain what Levine's role at the company will be, said the sources, who asked not to be named because no announcement has been made.
Levine, a geriatrician who has focused on treating elderly patients with complex medical conditions, could be joining Amazon's internal health-care group known as 1492, which is testing a variety of secretive projects.
 Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. We tried to contact Levine through LinkedIn and haven't heard back.
Last year, Amazon recruited health-technology expert Missy Krasner from Box. Krasner works on ""special projects"" at Amazon, according to her LinkedIn profile.
Amazon has also long been interested in learning about innovative health-care models. The company convened a secret meeting in Seattle a year ago with a group of executives that had rolled out creative approaches to patient care.

 This is Amazon's next big target   
 6:12  PM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 |  01:22 
 A half-dozen people outside of Amazon were in attendance, including representatives from Iora, Kaiser Permanente, and Qliance, a primary care group with funding from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos that shut down in May of 2017, one source said.
Iora has long been a standard-bearer for better primary care, which it achieves by investing in customer service. Its practices accept patients through an employer or a private Medicare plan. Most of these groups are looking to cut down on their health care costs.
Iora has raised more than $124 million in venture capital from a mix of technology and health investors.
Levine spent four years at Iora, according to LinkedIn. In the position of market medical director, he treated patients and also supervised a chain of clinics, designed the health plan and helped managed a team of about 45 staff. 
One potential role for Levine at Amazon might be to investigate whether the company should invest in new forms of primary care for its own employees. Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired last year, once explored getting into the health clinic space. CEO John Mackey told Bloomberg that he saw healthy food as key to solving American's health care problems.
""Many smart employers over the last several years have developed an onsite or near-site clinic,"" said Dave Chase, a Seattle-based health investor and an expert in employer health benefits. Chase said a clinic that served Whole Foods and Amazon employees would make ""economic sense.""

 Amazon's cashier-free store opens to the public

 Amazon's newly opened automated grocery store boasts ""Just Walk Out"" technology that automatically charges shoppers for the items in their bags — but CNBC made it out with a freebie on the store's first official day.
 We packed a shopping bag full of cookies, snap peas and Amazon-branded drinkware — all of which appeared on a virtual receipt moments later. But a single-serve Siggi's yogurt cup was noticeably dropped from the list. 
 We promptly confessed to Amazon, and VP of Amazon Go Gianna Puerini in return told us not to worry about it, and said that it's an extremely rare error. 
 ""First and foremost, enjoy the yogurt on us,"" Puerini said. ""It happens so rarely that we didn't even bother building in a feature for customers to tell us it happened. So thanks for being honest and telling us. I've been doing this a year and I have yet to get an error. So we've tried to make it super easy on the rare occasion that does happen either to remove it or enjoy breakfast on us.""
Siggi's didn't seem to mind the lost sales either. 
 Siggi's tweet
 The technology is intended to disappear for shoppers, Puerini said. Just sign in with the Amazon Go app when you enter the store and shop as you normally would. The app keeps track of what you pick up and put back on the shelves, and charges you for your final items when you leave through sensing gates. 
""The technology has been working great,"" she said — free yogurts aside. 
Puerini said the company has no plans yet to introduce the technology into Amazon-owned Whole Foods locations or to license the technology to other retailers.
But it's got a heavyweight supporter. 
""Jeff [Bezos] has been aware. He loves the store — he definitely has shopped it,"" Puerini said. ""He's been super supportive and wonderful.""

 A 'clash' between globalization and America First at Davos?   
 12:41  AM ET Tue, 23 Jan 2018 |  06:35 
 Amazon is threatening Google and Facebook's dominance of the digital ad space, Martin Sorrell told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday.
 The CEO of WPP, the world's largest ad company, explained why he saw a growth trajectory ahead for the American e-commerce giant's ad business. 
""Amazon threatens Google in two ways. One is search — 55 percent of product searches in the United States emanate from Amazon. So that's a big question for Google,"" Sorrell said.
 Still, Amazon's market share doesn't come close to the duopoly of Facebook and Google. The two tech and media behemoths control about 75 percent of the digital ad space, Sorrell said.
""Amazon's advertising platform itself — Google has about $100 billion in advertising, Facebook about $40 billion. Amazon has a fairly paltry pimple really, $2 billion or so, but growing quite quickly.""
The advertising tycoon said he spent about $5 billion with Google last year, roughly $2 billion at Facebook and $200 million on Amazon on behalf of WPP's clients. 
""This year we'll be ramping up to about $300 million,"" Sorrell said, ""so it's growing, but it's at a very small scale.""

 'Techlash'
 Sorrell also spoke about the issue of ""techlash,"" the rising tide of popular discontent with the ever-expanding reach of global technology companies. There are ""big issues"" surrounding privacy and employment in this realm, the British CEO described.
""A large reason for the rise of populism on both sides of Atlantic surrounds these issues around privacy and certainly about jobs, and how the economy will develop at a time when technology is becoming increasingly important.""""Yesterday, we had Amazon launching its employee-less store in Seattle,"" Sorrell noted. ""And the big question is does automation — do improvements in technology — actually create jobs, destroy them or keep them the same?""
Sorrell took over WPP as a small British wire shopping cart company in 1986, serving as its chief executive since that year. Its revenue in 2016 was more than $20 billion.

(L-R) Amazon's chief Jeff Bezos, Larry Page of Alphabet, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower December 14, 2016.
 Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google cumulatively racked up a roughly $50 million tab fighting off President Donald Trump and an onslaught of new federal regulations last year — a reflection that the tech industry is increasingly under political siege in the nation's capital.
Over the course of 2017, the biggest brands in tech warred with the White House over immigration, tried and failed to save net neutrality and weathered a congressional investigation into the ways in which Russian trolls spread propaganda on their sites during the last election.
The heightened scrutiny and withering criticism — targeting tech on everything from sex trafficking to fake news — prompted many companies to spend more money than ever to lobby the government, according to official ethics forms filed at midnight. And yet the industry's political activities in 2017 may only presage a tougher and costlier clash with Washington, D.C., in the year to come.
 Tech's most prolific political spender last year was Google, which dedicated more than $18 million to lobby the U.S. government. That's more than its tech peers, not to mention much of corporate America.
More from Recode:
 Here's why people on Twitter are seeing news alerts that they didn't ask for  Netflix now has nearly 118 million streaming subscribers globally  Bitcoin broker Coinbase booked $1 billion in revenue last year — so the company has told hovering VCs to back off 
Like other tech giants, Google sought to stave off new regulations targeting the content and ads that appeared on sites and services like search and YouTube. Meanwhile, the company pitched its own wares,  like self-driving cars, as lawmakers and other federal officials debated the new technology.
Amazon, meanwhile, spent more than $12.8 million in lobbying last year — nearly four times what it spent four years earlier — as it continued to advocate for friendlier federal rules around everything from online sales taxes and cloud computing to package-delivering drones. The company also had to contend in 2017 with fresh questions about the size of its corporate footprint, particularly after acquiring Whole Foods.
Facebook spent a record amount last year — roughly $11.5 million — as lawmakers railed on the social giant for the ""fake news"" and other content that appeared in users' feeds.
And Apple shelled out $7 million — again, more than ever — to lobby the U.S. government over the same period. The iPhone giant continued to press forward on issues like encryption and immigration. And the company — like the rest of the industry — advocated for the tax reform law recently signed by Trump.
Apple and Facebook declined to comment for this story; Amazon and Google did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
For much of tech, the industry's tough 2017 began as soon as Trump entered the White House and signed an executive order restricting immigrants and refugees from majority-Muslim countries. While federal courts later tossed that initial directive, Trump's early, aggressive stance on immigration only foreshadowed further restrictions, including those targeting  high-skilled foreign workers and their spouses.
More recently, tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have tapped their vast lobbying armies to  revive a program known as DACA. Scrapped by Trump in 2017, it had protected young immigrants who had been brought illegally to the U.S. as children from being deported. The future of DACA fed a stalemate in Congress this January that briefly caused the U.S. government to shut down.
Web companies, meanwhile, faced unfamiliar calls for fresh regulation in the nation's capital last year. For Facebook, Google and Twitter, it primarily came in the form of an investigation that found that hundreds of millions of their U.S. users had  fallen victim to Russian disinformation during the 2016 election..
In response, some lawmakers sought new federal rules governing the way that tech companies display political ads. But Facebook, Google and Twitter each devoted their seemingly limitless  lobbying resources toward fighting the measure, called the Honest Ads Act, as their federal disclosures show.
So, too, did that trio fight a proposal to hold social-media companies, ad networks and others accountable for enabling — or even failing to spot —  sex trafficking on their platforms. And these and other tech players lobbied extensively last year to  save the U.S. government's net neutrality rules, which the Federal Communications Commission ultimately scrapped in December anyway.
Those three fights — political ads, sex trafficking and net neutrality — remain unresolved at the beginning of 2018. Meanwhile, lawmakers and federal regulators are beginning to question the social costs of the digital age. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, for one, has emerged as one of  the more vocal critics of the ""downsides"" of social media.
Of course, the tech industry didn't totally lose in Trump's Washington last year. A major tax reform bill signed into law seems guaranteed to lessen tech giants' annual bills to the feds. To that end, Apple — a longtime advocate for tax reform — announced this month that it would reinvest billions of dollars in the United States.
Meanwhile, Uber also spent slightly more to lobby lawmakers and federal regulators last year. The ride-hailing giant in 2017 had to contend with a major executive shakeup, a series of allegations about sexism, multiple investigations into its business practices and a  major data security breach that it initially withheld from federal investigators.
Less known, however, is that the company began to lobby in Washington, D.C. for the first time on issues related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPPA. The 1996 law governs the privacy and security of medical information, and Uber declined to explain to Recode why it hired a lobbyist last year specifically to focus on the issue.
So too did Uber begin to share with federal regulators its ""advancements in vertical take-off and landing technology,"" or VTOL. Remember,  Uber has been exploring for years whether it's possible to fly its users around cities.

 });Amazon wasn't always a monster of a company. In fact, when Jeff Bezos started the company as an online bookseller in 1994, the fledgling business was running on money from Bezos' parents' life savings.
 Bezos had to be frugal. So when Amazon's then-handful of employees needed desks, the entrepreneur found a cheap solution — he hacked them together himself with a door as the desktop and four-by-fours for legs.
These days, Amazon has a $650 billion market cap and  CEO Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world. He owns a mansion in the same neighborhood as Barack Obama and Ivanka Trump, flies in a private jet and launched Blue Origin to pursue space travel.
 But the self-made billionaire keeps a token reminder about the importance of pinching pennies. Bezos' current desk at his Amazon office is still made out of a wooden door for the top and four pieces of wood for legs, according to a company spokesperson.
It's a more modern variation of the one he had back in the 90s, when Amazon's headquarters shared a block with a pawn shop and a heroin-needle exchange in Seattle. But for Bezos, the desk represents the frugal mindset he's held since the company's start, when he built that very first desk.

 ""We happened to be across the street from a Home Depot,"" Nico Lovejoy, the fifth employee of Amazon says, telling the story of how the desks came to be in an Amazon blog post. ""[Bezos] looked at desks for sale and looked at doors for sale, and the doors were a lot cheaper, so he decided to buy a door and put some legs on it.""
In 1999, Amazon was a public company, and Jeff Bezos was a billionaire, holding roughly $10 billion in Amazon stock, according to The New York Times. Still, the company was using desks made of doors. 
That year, Bezos told CBS's Bob Simon in a profile for for ""60 Minutes,"" the office space and door desks were to demonstrate an important value for the business. 
""It's a symbol of spending money on things that matter to customers and not spending money on things that don't,"" Bezos explains to Simon.

 Today, an upgraded version of the door desks are still used by employees in both corporate roles and in fulfillment centers, an Amazon spokesperson says. And frugality remains one of Amazon's leadership principles. 
""Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention,"" reads an Amazon leadership principle listed on its website.
Bezos even uses the desk as a symbol to recognize employees who come up with cost-saving ideas at Amazon's all-hands meetings, by presenting them with a miniature desk that he's signed, called the ""Door Desk Award."" Most recently, the award went to three employees who had an idea to use gift bags instead of gift wrap for presents, saving Amazon millions of dollars, according to the company.
To inspire others, anyone can even build their own door desk in six steps.
As for the original desks that Bezos himself made, ""They were pretty wobbly,"" Lovejoy says. ""You would never want to hire Jeff Bezos as a carpenter.
""He's much better at other things. I think he'd tell you the same thing.""

 Google's Play Store is making a bigger push into selling audiobooks, the company announced Tuesday, putting it in more direct competition with Amazon-owned Audible. 
 This move is particularly important as both Google and Amazon continue pushing their smart-speaker lines, the Home and Echo respectively. Right now, there's no integration between the Google Home and Amazon's Audible and Google's audiobooks won't play on the Echo. While both Home and Echo integrate with a large variety of outside services, they're becoming walled gardens against each other's content. As consumers decide which speaker to purchase, they may be swayed by whichever device gives them easier access to their audiobooks, or they'll buy audiobooks from whichever company makes their speaker. 
The company is rolling out a dedicated audiobook store on Play and the Google Play Books app works with both Android and iOS. 
 Google won't offer a subscription pricing plan like Audible does. Audible's cheapest subscription tier is one book a month for $14.95, which shaves as much as $10 off the price of a standalone audiobook. With Google, you can buy books only on a one-off basis.
Google launches the service with a handful of big discounts on titles such as ""Why Not Me?"" by Mindy Kaling ($5.99 on Google versus $21 on Audible without a subscription) or ""Lincoln in the Bardo"" by George Saunders ($8.99 on Google versus $24.50 on Audible without a subscription).
While it will take a deep-dive after the discounts expire to get a full pricing comparison, it seems that Google is trying to appeal to customers who don't read enough to want to buy into Audible's subscription model. 
Clarification: A previous version of this story said that the Play Store sold a ""small selection of audiobooks"" but a spokesperson denies that it classified any content previously available as audiobooks.

 });Amazon's new grocery store, Amazon Go, opened to the public on Monday in Seattle. It looks and feels like a normal grocery store, minus one key component: the checkout.
 Instead of swiping plastic or handing over cash, customers scan their Amazon Go app when they walk into the store, grab whatever they want and walk out. Their account is automatically charged when they leave.
Thanks to its ""Just Walk Out"" technology, Amazon Go offers customers a smooth, convenient experience. And as Jean Chatzky, financial editor of NBC's ""Today Show,"" points out on Twitter, that's not always a good thing. An automated store could end up being bad for your wallet: ""When you don't see the money leave your wallet and aren't even asked to swipe, it makes it too easy to spend.""
 Tweet
 How you pay matters. For example, researchers have found that paying with actual dollar bills is painful, because you're physically handing over your money and watching it disappear. That's why money experts recommend going cash only if you're looking to cut back: Using paper rather than plastic can help you save.

 ""Friction-free spending,"" by contrast, which means using a credit card or a mobile payment method like Apple Pay, encourages you to splurge. 
""The less friction there is, the easier it becomes to spend,"" Richard Feinberg of Purdue University  tells the New York Times. ""Just stand at Starbucks and watch how many people there use their smartphones to buy a latte.""
In the case of Amazon Go, as Chatzky mentions, you're not even asked to swipe. There's barely any friction, and while that can be great for your mood, it can be bad for your wallet.

An employee collects items ordered by Amazon.com customers through the company's two-hour delivery service Prime Now in a warehouse in San Francisco, December 20, 2017.
 Some Amazon sellers could soon get calls from Massachusetts state officials asking for unpaid sales taxes.
 On Tuesday, Amazon notified its marketplace sellers that the company has agreed to hand over important merchant information to the state of Massachusetts — including their federal tax ID numbers and the estimated value of inventory stored in Amazon's warehouses in that state.
The move — which is the first public case of Amazon handing over seller data to state tax officials — will help the state of Massachusetts identify which Amazon sellers may owe them unpaid sales taxes.
 It could also mean incredible headaches for the majority of third-party sellers who never comply with various state laws on sales tax collection — if more states follow Massachusetts and demand unpaid taxes from those sellers.
Amazon currently collects sales tax on that products it sells directly, but leaves it up to sellers on the platform to handle their own tax collection. Those independent sellers are responsible for charging sales tax in any state where they have a physical presence, including the states where they store their products.
In the notice to sellers, viewed by CNBC, Amazon said it would share the information with Massachusetts by January 26, 2018. Amazon initially refused to cooperate in September, but said in the note it decided to comply after receiving a ""valid and binding legal demand"" from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue. It also advised the sellers to consult with a tax adviser because ""each seller's business and tax needs are unique.""
The agreement would serve as an important case as it sets a precedent for other states to follow. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates that states are missing up to $13 billion in annual revenue by failing to collect sales taxes from remote sellers.
""It's game on in terms of sellers being targeted by states,"" said BuyBox Experts' partner James Thomson, who provides advisory service to Amazon sellers. ""Less than 10 percent of sellers are actually sales tax compliant, so every state has an incentive to get this information and audit sellers who aren't collecting.""
 Amazon vs. sellers
 Scott Peterson, VP of U.S. Tax Policy and Government Relations at Avalara, a tax software maker, says this case is being closely watched because it shows states taking action to collect sales taxes rather than waiting for new laws to get enacted.
""We are watching as the departments of revenue take their own action rather than waiting for laws to change,"" Peterson said. ""We have seen enforcement of many kinds on the rise, but this is certainly unique to watch.""
The situation is made more complicated by the fact that states have different sales tax laws —and have different rules about who is responsible for collecting them.
Some states, like Washington, Minnesota, and Rhode Island, have recently passed new laws requiring online marketplaces — like Amazon — to collect sales tax on behalf of its third-party sellers. South Carolina has filed a complaint arguing existing laws would make Amazon the responsible party for third party sales tax collection.
Massachusetts, however, doesn't have any existing laws requiring Amazon to take action. And if successful, other states that don't have similar laws in place will certainly look for ways to follow suit as it's easier to target individual sellers than a big company like Amazon.
""Successful strategies take on a life of their own,"" Peterson said. ""I would anticipate other states are paying close attention.""
 Dog and pony show
 The move is an about-face for Amazon. After the company refused to cooperate in September, the state of Massachusetts filed a court order forcing Amazon to turn over the data by mid-October. It wasn't clear if Amazon would relent or fight the court until now. (Amazon declined to comment, and the Massachusetts Department of Revenue didn't return a request for comment.)
Peterson noted that when someone uses language like ""valid and binding legal demand"" and agrees to comply, it typically means its lawyers have believe they're likely to lose in court.
But Paul Rafelson, a law professor at Pace University and a former tax counsel at GE, had a more nuanced view of the incident.
He says, given how common these requests are, it was strange to see Amazon react so aggressively against turning over the data. Instead, he thinks Amazon's resistance was likely a ""pretend fight"" put on to mitigate its liability against any seller that might decide to sue them over failing to help them be more tax compliant. Because Amazon currently takes a hands-off approach to third party sales tax collection, the company would be able to use this as one evidence of ""sticking up for the sellers,"" he said.
And the situation only gets trickier as Boston is in the running for a bid to win Amazon's second headquarters. Cities are offering all kinds of tax incentives to get Amazon's HQ2, which would create 50,000 new jobs and attract over $5 billion in investments.
""This is a bit of a dog and pony show,"" Rafelson said. ""This is such a basic request that there's no reason why Amazon wouldn't turn it over. It's just making kind of a big public show.""

 As the new owner of Whole Foods,  Amazon is doing exactly what the grocery chain would've done on its own, but has the capital to do it faster, said Panera founder and former Whole Foods board member Ron Shaich. 
 ""What is Amazon doing that Whole Foods wasn't going to do?"" Shaich told CNBC for  Fortt Knox. ""They're doing the same thing — lowering the prices to compete. And they're bringing the technology to bear, but they have air cover."" 
Amazon has dropped prices and introduced some of its own products at Whole Foods locations since completing the sale in August. 
 The e-commerce giant this week opened a high-tech convenience store with ""Just Walk Out"" technology that eliminates the need for cashiers or registers. The company has no plans to introduce the technology into Whole Foods stores just yet. 
Shaich was on the board of Whole Foods when Amazon approached the health food grocer about a buyout. He said it was pressure from activist investors that ultimately pushed the sale through. 
""The environment had changed,"" he said. ""You had Walmart and Target coming into organics. You had Aldi and Lidl coming in. There was going to be increasing price pressure. There needed to be significant investment in technology to adjust. And I think with activists at the door there wasn't the room quite frankly for them to take a long-term approach.""

John Hickenlooper
 At least one governor of a state still in the running for Amazon's second headquarters is ambivalent about winning the final bid. 
 Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper said he's ""not going to cry"" if Amazon chooses another of the 20 finalist metro areas over Denver, according to The Denver Post.
""There will be a sense of relief if they choose somewhere else, because there are a lot of challenges and lot of hard work we will be avoiding,"" Hickenlooper told the City Club of Denver on Tuesday, according to the Post. 
 His comments stand in stark contrast to the dozens of city and state officials eagerly vying for the company to set up shop. 
Still, Hickenlooper said Colorado is ""legitimately and sincerely"" pursuing the opportunity and said he believes the prospect is still largely positive.
""I wouldn't pursue it if I didn't think it's the right thing,"" he said.
Amazon has said it will spend $5 billion wherever it finally builds and will employ 50,000 people, which seems to be the sticking point for the Colorado governor. He expressed concern about making room for the additional employees in the already-crowded Denver area. 
Google recently moved in to nearby Boulder with a 200,000-square-foot campus. 
Denver was promoted as an early favorite in the race for HQ2, but the bid didn't fare well in CNBC's analysis of top contenders.

 });Amazon is getting into more brick-and-mortar stores. While the retail giant  purchased Whole Foods last year, Amazon had previously  opened up a convenience store for employees under its own brand in Seattle in 2016.
Amazon Go was supposed to be a cashierless, checkout-line-free store to help get people in and out faster — a convenience store of the future. But while Amazon employees have been able to use the store for the past year or so, it had failed to open to the public. Until now.
Recode Senior Editor  Jason Del Rey recently got a look at the store, which is located at the bottom of Amazon's main office tower in Seattle, before it opens to the public on Monday, Jan. 22. Let's take a look.
 You scan a special Amazon Go app on the way in to get access to the store. On the way out, you just walk out — no scanning.

 Amazon gets its most bullish Wall Street call yet: $1,800 price forecast   
 3:35  PM ET Thu, 25 Jan 2018 |  00:43 
 Amazon's cloud business is just getting started, according to one Wall Street firm.
 D.A. Davidson increased its price target for Amazon shares to $1,800 from $1,500, representing 33 percent upside to Wednesday's close. It's the highest target out of the 42 analysts who cover Amazon, according to FactSet. 
""We see two potential catalysts for shares over the next 12-month period: stronger-than-expected operating results from the company's cloud computing efforts, which we believe remains the primary driver of its share price and 2) due to its increasing mix of highly-profitable third-party sales (which surpassed 50% for the first time in 2Q17),"" analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note to clients Thursday.
 The firm also reiterated its buy rating. If Amazon's stock reaches Forte's $1,800 forecast, the company's market value would be nearly $870 billion.
Amazon's shares were up slightly Thursday. The company reports fourth-quarter earnings next Thursday.

Shoppers at a Best Buy store in Brooklyn, New York.
 Best Buy stock slipped Thursday after a top retail brokerage firm downgraded shares on fears that Wall Street has already priced in the store's rebound.
 Telsey Advisory Group cut its rating to market perform from outperform, sending shares sliding. Best Buy closed down 0.7 percent Thursday.
""The low hanging fruit has already been picked, and going forward, the company is increasing investments in technology, labor, and supply chain to maintain its leadership position,"" Telsey analyst Joseph Feldman wrote to clients. ""The overall product cycle remains average in 2018, with no highly-anticipated launches. Smart-home devices and appliances remain growth areas, while we anticipate weaker trends in computing and mobile phones.""
 Feldman added that given Best Buy's impressive performance in 2017, the new year will likely make for challenging same-store sales comparisons — a closely watched metric in retail. He anticipates same-store sales of -1.5 percent in the second quarter and -1 percent in the third quarter.
Best Buy shares are up roughly 70 percent the last 12 months after the retailer showed there still may be a place for an in-store experience with electronics. 
The analyst's new 12-month price target of $81 represents 5 percent upside from Wednesday's close.

 The already heated battle for the coveted Amazon HQ2 project has been a public relations win for the tech giant. But now Amazon is asking the North American cities among the finalists to use a tactic more often associated with Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos: Secrecy. CNBC's Scott Cohn confirmed on Thursday that Amazon has insisted cities shift to a confidential pitch mode as the second round progresses.
 At stake: a $5 billion facility that will employ 50,000 and boost state coffers by adding billions of dollars in additional investment in the surrounding community over the next 10 to 15 years.
Mayors across North America are choosing their words carefully.
 ""It's like a poker game,"" Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told CNBC at the United States Conference of Mayors on Thursday, explaining that it's time for cities to play their cards close to the vest. ""Bring the bidding war on,"" he said.
Just not in public.
The full list of 20 finalists includes some of the most competitive cities in the world and data compiled by CNBC bears that out. 
""We aren't gonna really talk about what's on the table,"" said Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Browser.
""It's a very secretive process. We're obviously bound by confidentiality,"" said Miami Mayor Francis Suarez.
""If I were to lay out out now what we'll offer it would be criticized and looked at, and determined whether it's good or bad,"" said Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney. But Philly's mayor did provide a little color. ""We have people saying we don't want Amazon because housing prices will go up or it will be too crowded. These are problems we'd love to manage.""

Jeff Bezos
 The trash talking may be over, but some of the incentives already offered are eye-opening: $7 billion from New Jersey (where Newark is a finalist), and potentially $5 billion from Maryland.
Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said it was too early to discuss incentives because Amazon has not yet made clear its expectations.
Some mayors were more willing than others to give limited pitches in response to CNBC questions at the annual mayors conference. 
Dallas Mayor Rawlings was one. Among his points:
Dallas has been growing faster than any city in the country and fast growth is a factor that both it and Amazon share. ""Nobody has grown faster or created more jobs than us,"" he said.
Rawlings also attempted to dispel a few myths. While Austin gets all the tech credit, Dallas has more tech employees — almost as many as in Seattle. And while Rawlings acknowledged the broader Texas ""red state"" reputation is an issue, especially given the tech industry's focus on social tolerance, he stressed that Dallas is ""a blue city in a red state,"" which has scored 100 on the LGBT Index for the past three years. ""There are concerns at the state level, but we are working through that,"" he said.
Dallas seems to think a factor that has often helped its state in CNBC's Annual Top States for Business ranking will help here too: it will be less expensive for Amazon on multiple fronts. Cheaper to build, lower cost of business, and lower cost of living, Rawlings said. And he made that pitch to Amazon shareholders.
""Shareholders will win,"" Rawlings said.
He also highlighted Dallas central placement in the country allowing roundtrip flights to both coasts. 
 And the real winner is ...
 Some outside observers insist that whether shouting from the hills or keeping as quiet as possible, cities aren't going to end up as the real winner.
""Amazon has algorithms and crawlers that go out and find the lowest prices and create this giant sucking sound, and they've taken it offline and effectively created a transfer in value from taxpayers to Amazon,"" said Scott Galloway, professor of marketing at New York University's Stern School of Business told CNBC on Thursday. ""It's a 'Hunger Games' environment to mature the best term sheet possible and ask a mayor to match, which will be irresistible,"" Galloway said. He added, ""Amazon is genius in occupying the front page, but this is, simply put, an incredibly deft calculation to extract several pounds of flesh.""
Many of the finalists were thought to be contenders from the start. They include cities CNBC has already visited as we evaluate the bids: Chicago, Columbus, Ohio; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Denver. But three dark horse candidates joined the list: Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Toronto. The list includes three locations in and around the nation's capital: Washington, D.C.; the Northern Virginia suburbs, and Montgomery County, Maryland. The area was already receiving buzz based on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' ownership of the Washington Post.
One important aspect of the secretive process that not even any of the mayors seem to understand: How long the decision will take for Amazon to make, and whether there will be another round of cuts before the winner is named. Mayors told CNBC's Scott Cohn at the conference that the decision could come by spring or not before next year. And while there are some expectations the list will get whittled down further, mayors don't know if that will be another round in the public process, or if the next words from Amazon will be, ""And the winner is ...""

An employee works at the Amazon Fulfillment Center on August 1, 2017 in Robbinsville, New Jersey.
 The FANG stocks' earnings season started off strong as Netflix crushed subscriber expectations Monday. One analyst is optimistic the other internet giants in the famed technology basket will also report strong earnings results next week. Netflix shares surged 15 percent in the two days following the stunning results.
 ""We expect its FANG brethren to continue the 'beat and raise' party next week by delivering stronger than expected earnings/2018 guidance,"" Daniel Ives, GBH Insights' head of technology research, wrote in a note to clients Thursday. ""Overall, we continue to be very bullish on secular tech themes for 2018 around streaming/content, e-commerce growth, online ad growth, and the transformational cloud shift among enterprises.""
FANG stocks are a basket of high-growth technology stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google).
 Ives reaffirmed his ""highly attractive"" ratings for Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook.
1) Amazon (AMZN)
The analyst raised his price target for Amazon shares to $1,500 from $1,375, representing 10.5 percent upside to Wednesday's close.
 ""We expect strength from Amazon across the board this quarter as our analysis indicates a better than performance on the North America retail channel as well on the AWS front … Amazon has a unique window of opportunity to double down on its consumer and enterprise initiatives for 2018 and drive significant growth/cash flow for the coming years as Bezos & Co. further diversifies the Amazon franchise globally."" 
Amazon will report its fourth-quarter earnings results on Feb. 1.
2) Alphabet (GOOGL)
Ives increased his forecast for Alphabet shares to $1,280 from $1,190, representing 9 percent upside to Wednesday's close.
 ""Our mobile search analysis/tracker this quarter continue to show strength from Google around its bread and butter search business, which should be a catalyst for modestly better than expected top and bottom-line results in 4Q as ad growth was the 'star of the show' this quarter. We are also seeing accelerating ad momentum from search and YouTube yet again this quarter and heading into 2018 despite noise in the market."" 
Alphabet will report its fourth-quarter earnings results on Feb. 1.
3) Facebook (FB)
The analyst reiterated his $225 price target for Facebook shares, representing 21 percent upside to Wednesday's close.
 ""Facebook is on a trajectory to have another solid quarter in 4Q on the MAU front and has strong momentum heading into 2018 on this all-important growth driver for the business, despite lingering clouds from the recent News Feed overhaul."" 
Facebook will report fourth-quarter earnings results on Jan. 31.

A woman runs an Apple iPad  with the iBooks application.
 Apple is going to again challenge Amazon dominance of digital books with a redesigned iBooks app, and has recently hired a former Amazon executive to help, according to a Bloomberg report. 
 The updated app will feature a simpler interface and a new tab specifically for audio books and is set to be released in the coming months, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the development. 
In December Apple hired Kashif Zafar, former senior vice president with Amazon's audio book unit Audible, to lead the effort. 
 The renewed effort in iBooks seems to be an attempt to regain market share in e-book services. Apple was once a bigger player in the space, but was fined in 2016 by the U.S. Department of Justice for conspiring with publishers to raise e-book prices.

People walk past the signature glass spheres under construction at the Amazon corporate headquarters on June 16, 2017 in Seattle.
 Landing Amazon's $5 billion new headquarters and its 50,000 tax-paying workers would be quite the coup. And possibly quite the headache.
Officials and civic organizers in some of the 20 cities now vying to win Amazon's choice for its second headquarters are sounding alarms that accommodating this tech talent invasion could put a big strain on local residents already grappling with crawling commutes and high housing prices.
In Nashville, citizens concerned about how a new Amazon headquarters might exacerbate already significant housing issues were blunt about how well-paid tech workers could drive up both the prices for rental units and homes alike.
 ""We have a housing crisis now and all this would do is throw gasoline on the fire,"" says John Summers, a former city council member who now leads the Coalition for Nashville Neighborhoods. ""We cannot build affordable housing to replace what's being lost by the rapid gentrification in all of our inner-city neighborhoods.""
Some even don't even seem to mind if Amazon picks another suitor. Just days after Denver made the finals, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper told the City Club of Denver ""I'm not going to cry,"" according to The Denver Post, if CEO Bezos didn't choose the Mile High City, 
While Hickenlooper later clarified that he was excitedly pursuing the headquarters because he felt it was the right thing for the city and state, he allowed that some citizens would feel ""a sense of relief if they choose somewhere else because there are a lot of challenges and lot of hard work we will be avoiding.""
In sprucing up their Amazon bids for billionaire CEO Jeff Bezos, cities ranging from Atlanta to New York will need to take an honest look at whether housing stock and public transportation — both critical to a winning bid — are up to the HQ2 challenge.
While cities such as Boston and New York are well-known for their efficient public transit systems, both suffer from aging infrastructure and struggle to keep up with existing demand.
Boston has been trying to find a solution for its growing traffic problems in part by efforts to link its commuter rail lines, says Barry Bluestone, professor of public policy at Northeastern University in Boston. ""Our town has the talent and the excitement (to win the bid), but we have to find a way to move these new workers,"" he says.
That's a concern shared even by fans of the Washington, D.C., area's three finalist bidders. Richard Bedrick, a graduate student studying real estate development at the University of Maryland at College Park, says that while he is excited D.C., northern Virginia and Montgomery County, Md., are all in the running, the traffic implications of a win make him pause.
""D.C. has enough (traffic) as it is,"" says Bedrick.
Those sentiments are echoed among some in finalists hubs such as Miami, Raleigh, N.C., and in particular Los Angeles, which already is notorious for its gridlock.

And then there's the influx of people that come with Amazon's second national headquarters.
Business owner Mina Lee grew up in Montgomery County, home of wealthy D.C. suburbs such as Bethesda, and says she is ""super excited"" and about the ""great opportunity"" of hosting HQ2. But at the same time she is concerned that a flood of new young workers and their families could cause overcrowding in schools.
""You're starting to see, I think, resistance and push-back to this continual grow, grow, grow, grow at any cost,"" says Nashville neighborhoods advocate Summers.
 Poorest may take biggest HQ2 hit
 The poorest in these bidder cities are likely to feel the biggest impact of HQ2, as Amazon employees boasting six-figure salaries accelerate neighborhood gentrification and price out existing residents.
For example, Denver's mild weather and ravishing outdoors has helped spur a multi-year business and population boom. But gentrification in many of the city's neighborhoods has become a sore spot as single-family bungalows are replaced by high-density townhouses for younger, wealthier residents.
""People here are enthusiastic about the benefits (of Amazon's HQ2), but those economic benefits often miss our most vulnerable citizens,"" says Daniel Brisson, executive director of the Burnes Center on Poverty and Homelessness at the University of Denver.

Housing clearly will be one, and some cities are already behind when it comes to housing stock. Bluestone has been helping to assemble the Greater Boston Housing Report Card for 15 years. The latest score notes that even without HQ2, ""Boston needs a minimum of 160,000 more housing units by 2030, and we're not producing that at the required rate.""
Such statistics indicate that the winning city must brace for ""two tales, one about winners and one about losers,"" says Javier Vivas, director of economic research for Realtor.com.
""These things push up home values based on increased demand, which is great some some folks, but it's not great news for existing residents hoping to get into the housing market who aren't on Amazon salaries,"" he says.
Smaller less developed markets, such as Raleigh and Columbus, are likely to better cope with 50,000 new tech workers than larger, housing-constrained cities such as Denver, Boston and New York, Vivas adds.
The prospect of HQ2 coming to the City of Angels led resident Lisa Connolly to write a pointed letter of warning to the Los Angeles Times.
""Amazon's cannibalization of Seattle's real estate market … would exacerbate an already unsustainable situation,"" she wrote. ""If we want Los Angeles to become the next San Francisco, this is a surefire and irreversible way to accelerate the process.""
Another concern, experts say, is simply making sure that in their eagerness to win Amazon's favor, cities don't overcommit on incentives that favor the tech company over their town.
""It's possible for a city to overpay for (Amazon's HQ2),"" says Adam Ozimek, a senior economist with Moody's. While the details of many bid remain secret, reports indicate that such incentives can range from around $100 million from Denver to $7 billion from Newark, N.J.
""You give too great an economic incentive and the tax burden simply goes up for everyone else,"" says Ozimek.
 Seattle as guinea pig
 A street near Amazon headquarters in downtown Seattle, where cranes dot the sky as new office buildings, condos and apartments are built. 
In fact, looking at Amazon's impact in its current headquarters city is a good way for the 20 cities battling for HQ2 to be catch a glimpse — for better and for worse — of their own futures.
The many positives include helping boost Seattle's economy, creating new businesses, boosting property values and energizing an area previously known for its parking lots and warehouses.
But Amazon's presence hasn't been all roses, says Jeffrey Shulman, professor of marketing at the University of Washington. For starters, he cautions that real estate speculators eager to flip lots and properties will descend on the HQ2 winner, making it difficult for lower-income families to stay put.
That sort of change then steamrolls into neighborhood makeovers, where yoga studios and coffee shops suddenly replace laundromats and bars to accommodate a wealthier clientele.
Two more side effects of the HQ2 win will be a boom in construction, as evidenced by Seattle's now perpetually crane-filled skyline, and a growing war for talent that may leave other area businesses high and dry.
""In Seattle, you're seeing some residents feeling that their communities are vanishing, people who now feel like strangers in their own hometown,"" says Shulman, who studies Amazon's impact on the city.
That some won't be happy with the result either way is a given, says economist Ozimek.
""People would complain in a literal utopia,"" he says with a laugh. ""There will be lots of cities looking at Seattle and, hearing their complaints, will go, 'Are you kidding me?'""

 Amazon's ad business will boost the internet giant's shares, according to one top Wall Street firm.
 Morgan Stanley increased its ""bull case"" price target for Amazon shares to $2,100 from $2,000. The new price represents 52 percent upside to Thursday's closing price. The firm also raised its ""base case"" forecast for the stock to $1,400 from $1,250.
If the company's stock reaches the ""bull case"" forecast, Amazon's market value would be $1.01 trillion.
 Analyst Brian Nowak told clients in a note Friday that he had previously underestimated the advertising aspect of Amazon's business, saying we ""remain bullish Amazon's ad opportunity as the company continues to drive its high margin revenue stream businesses that enable it to invest harder than ever and deliver upward revisions.""
The analyst reiterated his overweight rating for Amazon shares. 
He predicts the $55 billion currently being spent by companies to get good shelf space and other advantages with brick-and-mortar retailers could move to online ad spending, benefiting Amazon. As a result, he estimates Amazon's sponsored ad business will grow 54 percent per year from 2016 to 2019.
Amazon shares rose 1.6 percent Friday morning.
The company will report its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.

 });If you invested $1,000 in Amazon or Apple 10 years ago, that investment would have seriously paid off. According to personal finance website DQYDJ, an initial $1,000 investment in those companies in 2008 would be worth $16,239 and $8,587, respectively, as of January 16.
 If you invested $1,000 in Google in the same time frame, it would have paid off, too. According to DQYDJ, GOOGL would be worth $3,660 as of January 16 and GOOG would be worth $2,008. (Google's stock split into two classes in 2014: GOOGL: Alphabet Class A and GOOG: Alphabet Class C.)
Still, the data shows that one company significantly outperformed Amazon, Apple and either class of Alphabet: Netflix. As of January 16, a $1,000 investment in the video-streaming service would be worth a whopping $70,263.
 Netflix first launched its streaming service in 2007, began producing original content in 2013 and has grown its subscriber base to nearly 120 million accounts worldwide. 
The company also added more than eight million subscribers in the fourth quarter, CNBC reports, significantly more than Wall Street expectations, and its shares have jumped more than 8 percent, bringing its market capitalization above $100 billion for the first time.

 The company plans to spend $7.5-8 billion on content in 2018, including shows from titan Shonda Rhimes and comic book company Millarworld. ""We believe our big investments in content are paying off,"" the company wrote in a letter to shareholders.
But while Netflix's stock has performed well and the company has high hopes for the future, any individual stock can over- or under-perform. Past returns do not predict future results.
Plus, there are some challenges on the horizon. Competitors, such as Disney, which has agreed to buy 21st Century Fox assets, could potentially pull viewers from Netflix with plans to launch their own streaming services.

 Disney's deal with Fox would give the combined company a stake in Netflix's rival, Hulu. In addition, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and YouTube have added more content to their respective platforms.
So some investors are bearish. Jim Cramer, host of CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" though, isn't one of them. With Netflix raising the monthly cost for its streaming service and adding more original content to complement already popular shows like ""The Crown"" and ""Stranger Things,"" Cramer, in October, said the company could accelerate its growth even further.
Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, said he doesn't want to get ""too distracted by the competitive landscape."" The company agrees. ""The market for entertainment time is vast and can support many services,"" it notes. ""Entertainment services are often complementary, given their unique content offerings. We believe this is largely why both we and Hulu have been able to succeed and grow.""
If you're considering getting into the stock market, experts advise beginning carefully.
Experienced investors Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban and Tony Robbins suggest you start with index funds, which offer low turnover rates, attendant fees and tax bills, and fluctuate with the market to eliminate the risk of picking individual stocks.

 DQYDJ's stock return calculator tool, which gathers its numbers from data-platform Quandl, properly accounts for stock splits and special dividends by creating a ""data structure [that] contains the initial purchase and the price fluctuations using stock closing prices on each day,"" according to the site. ""Normal splits and dividend events cause us to increase the modeled number of shares held. Reverse splits will reduce the number of shares held.""
The results are cached for up to one week so as not to overwhelm the data provider. The calculator does not account stock spinoffs. And while it does have a reinvestment tool, Netflix's closing number, above, does not account for reinvestments.
""Returns calculated are idealized and will not match the exact returns you realized if you invested over these time-frames,"" the site adds. ""We are not modeling taxes, management fees, dividend payment timing, slippage or other sources of error.""

 Trading Nation: Amazon's amazing run   
 3:42  PM ET Thu, 25 Jan 2018 |  02:55 
 Amazon shares have surged 20 percent this year, but one technician warns the stock could see a pullback in the near future.
 Craig Johnson, senior technical strategist at Piper Jaffray, is concerned that Amazon shares are trading in overextended territory and said it could be following a pattern from years past.
""It's very similar to what you'd seen back in early 2013, also in early 2016. When you got this far extended usually there was some sort of setback and a healthy correction that took place,"" Johnson said on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Thursday.
 Amazon slumped 5 percent in April 2013 and another 7 percent in August after trading at 160 times forward earnings at the beginning of that year. In the previous 12 months before the April pullback, Amazon shares had rallied 32 percent.
Despite a retreat in April and August of 2013, the stock ended the year 59 percent higher. Losses picked up in 2014, and its shares ended the year 22 percent lower.
Then, in 2016, Amazon slumped 13 percent in January and another 6 percent in February after peaking at an all-time high of 881 times forward earnings a year earlier. Over the previous 12 months to the January retreat, shares had risen 118 percent. Amazon ended 2016 around 11 percent higher.
Amazon's current fundamentals suggest its share price is expensive at the moment, says Michael Binger, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments. Free cash flow, a metric Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos uses to measure company health, relative to earnings price puts the company at an extreme premium to its peers.
Binger expects free cash flow to grow 30 percent through to 2019. At its current price, that represents a 33 times free cash flow multiple. Its high-growth peers — such as Facebook, PayPal and Adobe — trade around 25 times estimates free cash flow for 2019.
By a more traditional metric, the price-to-earnings ratio, Amazon is still well above its peers. The e-commerce company trades at 165 times forward earnings. That's at least 6 times the PE ratio of Facebook, Apple, PayPal and eBay. Walmart trades at 22 times forward earnings, Costco at 28 times and Target at 15 times.
Amazon's 20 percent runup in the year to date is roughly triple the S&P 500's gains. The Consumer Discretionary SPDR ETF, which weights Amazon at 17 percent, is up 10 percent in January.
Amazon spiked this week and reached all-time highs after D.A. Davidson set a $1,800 price target on Amazon, the highest on the Street by a wide margin. That target outpaces the second-highest by $200 and implies 29 percent upside to current levels. Analysts adjusted their target based on optimism over Amazon's growth in cloud computing and increased third-party sales on its platform. Brokerage firms have an average buy rating and $1,371.88 price target on Amazon, according to those surveyed by FactSet.
Trading in Amazon shares could become more active when the company reports earnings next week. Analysts expect quarterly earnings of $1.88 a share, up from $1.54 a year earlier, and for sales to surge nearly 37 percent year over year. Amazon reports alongside Apple and Alphabet on Thursday, Feb. 1.

 Amazon could see a huge move on earnings next week, and it’s making some investors nervous   
 5:08  PM ET Fri, 26 Jan 2018 |  00:56 
 Amazon is set to report earnings next Thursday after the market closes, and the options market is implying a relatively large post-earnings move for the stock. One derivative strategist said the move is expected to be quite notable.
 ""Investors are really nervous about this stock, just in terms of how big the movement could be,"" Stacey Gilbert, head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna, told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Friday. Here are her reasons.
• The options market is implying a move of about 7 to 8 percent on its earnings report. This is high relative to its average post-earnings move of around 5 percent. Amazon's last earnings report, in October, saw an initial move higher of over 7 percent.
 • The move is likely to be bullish, but investors are bracing for the sheer magnitude of the options market's implied move.
• The bullish options buying is driving up this volatility, but the sentiment continues to appear positive despite the rather volatile expectations.
• As the stock is already up a hefty 20 percent year to date, it's not entirely surprising to see investors utilizing options to express their opinions heading into this earnings report.
Bottom line: Investors are expecting a significant move post-earnings for Amazon shares.

 Amazon will be able to compete against Google and Facebook in the internet ad business, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Citi Research reiterated its buy rating for Amazon shares, predicting strong growth for its internet advertising business.
""Amazon is one of the highest quality companies in the Internet sector considering its consistent innovation and execution, the size of the opportunities it is pursuing, and its positioning within those future growth opportunities,"" analyst Mark May wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""Amazon is currently our top pick in part due to the ad opportunity still being under-appreciated.""
 May increased his price target for Amazon shares to $1,600 from $1,400, representing 14 percent upside to Friday's close.
The analyst noted while Google and Facebook combined have nearly 70 percent share of the U.S. digital ad market, he is optimistic Amazon will be able to leverage its e-commerce retail operations to grow its ad business.
""Amazon has some obvious potential advantages over Google and Facebook. For instance, unlike any other platform — even Google and Facebook — Amazon combines global audience scale and engagement with actual conversion and transactional data,"" he wrote. ""Any new meaningful competitor could take share from an already concentrated market — especially as advertisers and agencies are increasingly interested in diversifying their spend beyond the two goliaths.""
May predicts Amazon's ad business sales will grow to $50.6 billion by 2028 from $10.2 billion this year.
Amazon shares are up 68 percent in the previous 12 months through Friday versus the S&P 500's 25 percent gain.
The company's shares are up 0.4 percent in Monday's premarket session after the report. Amazon will report its fourth-quarter earnings results on Thursday.

 Amazon is testing a new invitation-only program that would provide sellers with more efficient storage and shipping options and allow merchants to add Amazon's software and logistics into their own warehouses.
 Amazon described the new service, called FBA Onsite, as a ""groundbreaking"" program that combines the best parts of its existing fulfillment programs and brings down shipping rates, according to an invitation that was sent to sellers and viewed by CNBC.
The invitation also notes that the program should be considered a ""work in progress"" as Amazon will continue to refine the process based on user feedback. Bloomberg first reported the program on Monday.

 4:04  PM ET Mon, 29 Jan 2018 |  02:51 
 The trial program started about three months ago and invited less than 50 sellers, according people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak about it.
It's Amazon's latest effort to solve its warehouse congestion problem by using storage space owned by third-party sellers on the platform rather than just building out more fulfillment centers.
FBA Onsite could also draw more sellers to the Prime two-day shipping program with significantly lower shipping rates.
 Warehouse congestion
 According to two sellers, Amazon is scheduled to send a representative to visit their warehouse and help reconfigure the layout and general fulfillment process. One photo in the invitation shows a fenced area dedicated only to Amazon's inventory. Sellers participating in the program also get to install Amazon's own warehouse management program, which would significantly shorten the time to upload a product into Amazon's database and website. 
An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.
For the sellers, FBA Onsite would help save on shipping as they no longer have to get their inventory to Amazon's warehouses. Amazon is also offering much lower shipping rates for two-day delivery by letting the sellers take advantage of the low rates Amazon gets from shipping companies. One seller said he's using Amazon's own shipping accounts for FedEx, UPS, and the post office, getting discounts of up to 85 percent from what he normally pays.
 Source: Amazon
What a warehouse under Amazon's FBA Onsite program would look like.
 Amazon currently offers Seller Fulfilled Prime, which lets sellers ship Prime-eligible products directly from their own warehouses — but without the benefit of low shipping rates. It also offers Fulfillment by Amazon, where sellers send their inventory to Amazon's warehouses and use the company's logistics system.
""FBA Onsite is a way for Amazon to significantly increase their sales with almost zero additional overhead cost,"" one seller said.
 Amazon's own delivery service
 Chad Rubin, co-founder of e-commerce software maker Skubana, said FBA Onsite could help sellers that have struggled with warehouse management, a constant headache for most of them. 
He also said that sellers have been reluctant to join Amazon's existing Seller Fulfilled Prime program because two-day delivery from their own warehouses is too costly.
Rubin said the biggest advantage to Amazon is that the company gets to test its delivery system to FBA Onsite sellers, potentially with its own trucks and personnel.
""Amazon is probably going to inject their own logistics and carrier system and offset USPS from doing final delivery,"" Rubin said.

 Stocks on the move after Amazon, Berkshire and JP Morgan announce health-care partnership   
 8:42  AM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  02:50 
 Shares of insurer Express Scripts and other health-care related stocks slid Tuesday after Amazon, J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway announced a partnership to improve employee health.
 The three companies, led by Jeff Bezos, Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett, plan to develop ways to improve the health of their employees, with the goal of improving customer satisfaction and reducing costs.
""The three companies, which bring their scale and complementary expertise to this long-term effort, will pursue this objective through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints,"" the announcement said.
 Drug distributor Express Scripts' stock fell 5 percent by midday. Cigna was off by 6 percent, CVS Health dropped 4 percent and Walgreens Boots Alliance fell 5 percent. UnitedHealth Group also was down 4 percent and Aetna fell by about 2 percent.
Details of the new company were still unclear, but that didn't stop traders from sending these shares reeling on the notion that these three titans of business could shine a light on where these companies need lower costs.
Pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Amgen also slipped, down 3.2 percent and 3.1 percent respectively.

 ""The comments in the press release suggest that these leaders view this as an endeavor that is complex, challenging and thorny and that will take time to bear fruit,""wrote Ana Gupte, analyst at Leerink Partners. ""It is unclear if this means Amazon will accelerate its entry into the pharmacy supply chain, though the quest for transparency, which is lacking currently in drug pricing and also in broader healthcare delivery in America, would point to a more transformative effort by the new entity.""
The announcement comes amid months of speculation that Amazon's Bezos would lead the e-commerce giant into the health-care space.
""The healthcare system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty,"" Bezos said in the announcement. ""Hard as it might be, reducing healthcare's burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort.""
A key issue for the Trump administration, the rising cost of health care and pharmaceuticals has frequently drawn criticism from President Donald Trump.
 Tweet
 Trump said in October that his administration would stop paying Obamacare insurers billions of dollars in reimbursements for discounts that insurers must give by law to low-income customers of their plans.
""If this winds up being the low cost provider to make insurance more affordable at employer level, could wind up being a real disruptive competitor to an industry that has not seen any new players in years/decades,"" Jefferies analyst Jared Holz said in email. ""[I'm] not going to call this [a] black swan event yet because there are few details and would be making too many assumptions but it has potential to be.""
Buffett and Dimon also commented on the new company in the press release.
""The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy. Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable,"" Berkshire's Buffett said.
""Our people want transparency, knowledge and control when it comes to managing their healthcare,"" said JP.P. Morgan's Dimon. ""The three of our companies have extraordinary resources, and our goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees.""
Shares of Amazon, J.P. Morgan, and Berkshire Hathaway were little changed.

 Don't count insurers out on new Amazon, Berkshire and JP Morgan health-care plan   
 8:01  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  02:22 
 Calling health-care costs a hungry tapeworm on the economy, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan say they are joining forces to try to simplify their employee benefits using technology make for a better health-care experience and to drive down costs.
 The news hit like a shot across the bow of health insurers, sending shares of Cigna, Anthem, UnitedHealth and Aetna tumbling. Pharmacy benefit management firms Express Scripts and CVS Health also fell on the news.
""I think particularly with Amazon in play, it reflects an almost evangelical faith people have that they can disrupt established business problems in the way that they've done in many other industries,"" said Niall Brennan, president of the Health Care Cost Institute, while cautioning that the market may have overreacted.
 ""Employers have been trying and struggling to do this for 20, 30 or more years with ... unfortunately, limited success,"" he said. ""I really applaud it and I couldn't be more supportive, but we really need to see a lot more details beyond a press release.""
What could make this effort different from other employer cost-cutting initiatives is that the firms are coming together to form a not-for-profit company to try to leverage the companies' market power; combined the trio have more than half a million U.S. employees.
The question is whether the venture will try to do that by knocking out the middlemen who negotiate hospital networks and prices, and pharmacy benefit contracts with drugmakers.
""I think that those who are selling their shares in health-care stocks are reading this all wrong,"" said Jim Klein, American Benefits Council president. ""The middlemen here have an interest that is aligned with employers. They are the intermediaries with the health-care providers. The main problem with health care these days ... is that cost and quality are not aligned.""
A number of health-care firms hailed the news, saying they want to be on board.
Aetna and CVS — which have announced a $69 billion deal to merge their insurance and pharmacy into an integrated health clinic service — both said they welcome the chance to help the firms with the new venture.
""There is an unmet consumer need in health care. Individuals and families want a simple, affordable and high-quality experience that helps them stay well,"" said Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini in a statement, adding ""I am encouraged to see other companies working toward the same goal.""
Pharmacy benefit firm Express Scripts said in a statement, ""Today's announcement by Amazon, J.P. Morgan Chase, and Berkshire Hathaway is clear recognition that the healthcare system needs to continue to create and deliver meaningful value to payers and patients … We look forward to hearing more about this new initiative and how we can work together to improve health care for everyone.""
Until now the fear has been that Amazon would enter health care as a competitor to these services, but combining with other employers would still put the tech giant in a position to exert tremendous pricing pressure on health care.
""The best results that we've seen have come from jumbo employer efforts — from them either teaming together or doing pilot projects on their own to prove that something is a good idea and then everybody else gets in line and adopts similar approaches,"" said Tracy Watts, senior partner at benefit consulting firm Mercer.
It's not clear how soon Amazon, Berkshire and J.P. Morgan's new health-care venture would launch, but with tech giants like Apple and Google also increasingly focused on health-care, current players in the industry have to brace for continuing disruption.
""This puts the market on notice,"" said Watts.

 How to play the Amazon-Berkshire-JP Morgan health care move   
 7:18  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  01:00 
 When Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan announced a partnership to cut costs and improve services across the health care industry, CNBC's Jim Cramer had to weigh in.
 The joint venture, organized by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and J.P. Morgan's Jamie Dimon, will aim to be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints,"" the companies said on Tuesday.
""It's bad enough that the most important man in finance, the most important man in retail and the best investor alive are teaming up to tackle the problems of our health care system, but even worse for the industry, they're doing it for free,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""It is very hard to compete with someone who doesn't care about turning a profit.""
 The initiative elevates the discussion around rising health care costs in the United States, which Cramer said the three titans view as ""the ultimate tax on the system.""
In May 2017, Buffett said that in 50 years, health care has gone from being 5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) to 17 percent with few solutions in sight to curb surging costs.
""Now that's going to change,"" Cramer said. ""Now there is something on the horizon, a company of his own creation with the most technologically savvy provider of what people want and the smartest banker of our time.""
The ""Mad Money"" host also noted the analyst community's eerily calm reaction to the deal. No analyst covering health care retailers like CVS or in-the-line-of-fire middlemen like Express Scripts wants to come out and slash the estimates for those companies right away, he said.
""But I bet the analysts who actually cover Jeff, Jamie and Warren's companies — Amazon, J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway — would view this coalition with a very different, awestruck attitude. I'll tell you, if these guys were coming after my business, I'd be terrified,"" Cramer said.
Some analysts were able to compose sound defenses, including that UnitedHealth's Optum service is already tackling costs and that the middlemen save costs by buying as a group.
But Cramer came back with some retorts: the incumbent companies are still not as digitally savvy as this new player will be, and their teams of government lobbyists won't be of any use when it comes to Bezos, Buffett or Dimon.
What does that mean for investors? Cramer's answer was somewhat complicated, particularly for investors who can't wait to get in on the action.
Even leading players like UnitedHealth aren't safe from being in the ""penalty box"" for some time, he said.
""You need a health care company that's survived every onslaught imaginable,"" Cramer said. ""You need a road warrior with a stock that you'll want to load up on into weakness if Amazon talks about this effort on its Thursday night conference call, or the non-profit comes up with a name or a chief executive.""
Investors also need a stock that is cheap with positive prospects that are supported by the technicals, the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""In short, you need Centene,"" he said. ""Centene's an expert at providing its clients with high-quality care at the lowest possible costs, and yet it's been making its shareholders a fortune.""
Centene, a large, enterprise-facing provider of Medicare and Medicaid, was even blessed by technician Marc Chaikin as one of the best health care stocks on Monday, Cramer added.
Still, Cramer maintained that buyers should time their investments wisely.
""I don't like to enter a blast zone on the first day of a sell-off, especially when there are still plenty of stocks outside the blast zone that have come down,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""So if you want health care exposure, I suggest waiting until the group's a little less radioactive. But if you just can't resist, if you need to pick one up this week, I'd say buy Centene.""

 Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan Chase to partner on health-care   
 4:01  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  01:23 
 Amazon's new health-care partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan Chase won't have an immediate impact on its employees' health-care plan, the company said in an email sent to all employees on Thursday.
 In the email, obtained by CNBC, Amazon's HR boss Beth Galetti wrote that the new partnership will take a ""considerable amount of time"" to come to fruition, and that ""nothing is changing"" to Amazon's current health-care offering to employees.
It also stressed that the goal of the initiative is to improve health care ""for all of our U.S. employees,"" while reducing costs. 
 The email underscores the long-term view Amazon is taking on this health-care initiative, and the time and effort it expects to take to make a real impact on the health-care industry. 
In a press release on Thursday, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan Chase announced a plan to form a separate, not-for-profit company that will tackle the high costs associated with U.S. health care.
The announcement characterized the partnership as a ""long-term effort,"" while Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said that the plan would require ""long-term orientation."" Amazon's Galetti, Berkshire Hathaway's investment officer Todd Combs and J.P. Morgan Chase's managing director Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold are currently seeking a management team to lead the new company and a headquarters location.
Here's the full text of the email Amazon shared with its employees about the partnership:
 Fellow Amazonians, I want to share with you a new initiative we're undertaking in partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase. We will be working together to improve healthcare for all of our U.S. employees and reduce costs. This initiative will take a considerable amount of time, and nothing is changing with our current healthcare offering. We will let you know well in advance of any changes. Thank you, Beth Galetti

 They're signaling to private sector the problem with health care: The Cleveland Clinic executive advisor   
 1:42  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  06:29 
 The new Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan Chase partnership is a great opportunity to bring down costs in the health-care industry, Cleveland Clinic Executive Advisor Toby Cosgrove told CNBC on Tuesday.
 The three companies announced Tuesday they will launch an independent operation aimed at reducing health-care costs and improving services for their U.S. employees. 
In an interview with ""Power Lunch,"" Cosgrove said the collaboration is a signal to the private sector about the problems in health care and the need to do something.
 ""The rising cost of U.S. health care is a huge threat to the U.S. economy,"" he said.
In fact, 20 percent of hospitals in the country are running in the red, he pointed out.
""We're working very hard to take costs out, and we've taken an enormous amount of costs out, but we need a more efficient system supporting us,"" said Cosgrove, who was CEO of the Cleveland Clinic from 2004 through 2017.  He believes the private sector should do things to reduce the costs because the system can't totally depend on the government to do so.
""They have to put wellness things in place. They have to begin to understand how people go to the correct providers. They have to begin to drive the efficiency of purchasing.""
Earlier Tuesday on CNBC, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders mentioned Cosgrove as a good potential CEO candidate for the new partnership.
Cosgrove said he hasn't had any discussions with any of the parties involved.
When asked if he'd be interested in such a role, he responded, ""I'm always interested in talking to people about things I think help the U.S. economy and U.S. health care.""

 Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan Chase to partner on health-care   
 4:01  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  01:23 
 Three of the country's most powerful companies coming together to use technology to improve the health-care system — and lower the system's costs along the way — sounds like a great idea.
 But turning that idea into reality will be tough, experts said Tuesday.
Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan Chase announced Tuesday that they're banding together to create a company geared toward reducing health-care costs and improving services for U.S. employees.
 But the trio was light on the details beyond saying the new independent company's initial focus would be on developing ""technology solutions"" and that the firm would be ""free from profit-making incentives and constraints.""
""The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,"" Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett said in a statement. ""Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable. Rather, we share the belief that putting our collective resources behind the country's best talent can, in time, check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.""
Gregg Slager, group leader of Ernst & Young's global health transaction advisory services division, said the three companies' desire to control health costs makes sense, given the fact that those costs are increasing, along with the patients' direct responsibility for health bills. But banding together may not be sufficient to change the health-care system's costliest components.
Health spending equals 18 percent of the nation's gross domestic product and is expected to reach 20 percent by 2025. The bulk of health-care expenses are hospitals and physicians, according to National Health Expenditure data compiled by Evercore ISI.
Evercore health-care analyst Ross Muken told CNBC that bending the overall health-cost curve ""isn't about controlling drug prices, modernizing the supply chain or improving devices.""
""Those are all relatively small parts of spending and some of those parts are deflationary already,"" Muken said. ""This is about getting to the guts of the system and where the inefficiency lies, which is physicians and hospitals."" 
In a note to clients published Tuesday, Muken said the stated mission of the companies' venture ""seems remarkably well placed as the government has failed at managing costs in healthcare for decades.""
""However, despite all the money and brain power likely devoted to what is going to be a seemingly [not-for-profit] effort the challenge here is massive. The reality is that a majority of the costs in the system sit within organizations that are difficult to reform and currently borderline profitable (providers),"" he said.
""Furthermore, trying to tackle physician compensation also seems like a heroic effort and one that is likely to cause massive uproar, particularly amongst the senior population.""
 Experts noted that one way employers have tried to address their health costs is by narrowing networks of medical providers covered by insurance plans, limiting which doctors, hospitals and labs patients can go to for care without paying significantly more out of pocket.
This new partnership could possibly create a new care network that steers people away from expensive sites of care when it's unnecessary, said Tim Van Biesen, a partner in Bain & Company's health-care practice.
One possibility is Amazon creating a platform that can direct patients to lower-cost options such as telemedicine or walk-in retail clinics. But whether that and other hypothetical steps taken by the three companies will result in markedly lower overall costs is still unknown.
Also, the trio is not the first group of outsiders to try to disrupt the health-care space. 
""This industry has seen some big companies try and change and exit as quickly as they came in,"" said Vaughn Kauffman, U.S. health services and new entrants advisory leader at PwC.
The new joint venture ""could be disruptive"" and put competitive pressure on pharmacy giants CVS and Walgreens and pharmacy benefit managers, said Mickey Chadha, a vice president at Moody's. But he added that the regulatory burden around every aspect of health care puts ""any new entrant in the space at a huge disadvantage, and companies like CVS, Walgreens, United Healthcare, Aetna and Express Scripts already have large scale, which allows for better vendor and drug manufacturer contracting and the ability to serve national clients.""
Experts have anticipated more deals and vertical integration in the wake of CVS announcing its intention to buy Aetna. That deal ""is even more compelling as a more coordinated approach to medical care is necessary to lower the overall health-care costs for consumers,"" Chadha said.
But Craig Garthwaite, director of the health enterprise management program at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, said the thin amount of detail in the press release announcing the companies' venture does not give much reason to believe it will result in radical change in health costs.
""While we don't know their business plan, there's not a lot of optimism their press release generates given it's just retreading a lot of buzzwords given by people who don't really think about how to lower costs and improve quality of health-care,"" Garthwaite said. 
Gary Claxton, vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the biggest driver of health costs is the money spent on sick and very sick people.
""It's not clear what private payers can do"" to drive down those costs, Claxton said, referring to insurance plans such as those offered by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, J.P. Morgan Chase and other businesses, as opposed to large publicly provided health coverage systems such as Medicare and Medicaid.
Claxton said that once a patient is undergoing treatment for their condition, costs can quickly pile up without the patient themselves having the time or the inclination to shop around for a better price, particularly when their health plan is picking much of the cost.
""If you're in cancer treatment or your kid's in cancer treatment, are you looking to save the next marginal dollar?"" Claxton asked. ""No.""
The relatively high cost of the American health-care system — which is much higher than that in other wealthy countries — makes it an attractive target for companies that believe they can save money by finding efficiencies and doing business differently than it has been done in the past, said Claxton.
There have been prior initiatives by non-health-care companies to band together regionally to try to lower their combined health costs. Some have had ""modest success,"" at best, Claxton said. However, none of them lowered their costs so dramatically that their model was adopted on a broad scale.
A new entrant trying to disrupt health-care costs faces a system that has already seen large-scale consolidation across different subsectors of the industry — including insurers, hospitals and drug companies — that will make squeezing out extra dollars in savings more difficult, Claxton said. And in the areas where big savings might be possible, there is often a reluctance to take the steps necessary to achieve those savings.
""We're not in the business of saying, 'We don't want new drugs developed,'"" Claxton said.
He also cited the case of one CEO he had heard of who was told his company's health plan could save $1 million annually by cutting out a local hospital from the network of providers covered by the plan.
Despite the fact that the area where the company was located did not lack for other hospitals, Claxton said, the CEO rejected the idea out of hand.

 Don't count insurers out on new Amazon, Berkshire and JP Morgan health-care plan   
 8:01  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  02:22 
 Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan Chase are teaming up to reduce health care costs for their own employees. 
 Among the likely big winners: Telemedicine companies like Teladoc and American Well.
Start-ups that offer virtual care as an alternative to sending an employee to a physical doctor's office, will likely play a big role in lowering costs. These companies have spent the past decade pushing for federal and state governments to provide clinicians with a way to bill their patients for consultations conducted via video or over the phone, and have made some major progress.
 These apps provide a first-step alternative to visiting a doctor in person, which is a real hardship for many Americans living in rural areas. Because they live so far from doctors, a lot of people in rural areas delay or avoid doctor's visits until they're really sick.
 Lindsey Wasson | Reuters
Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos speaks at the new Amazon Spheres opening event at Amazon's Seattle headquarters in Seattle, Washington, U.S., January 29, 2018.
 Getting them to take a ten-minute call with a doctor to figure out next steps could drive down costs for employers. The last thing that a company like Amazon wants is an employee to make an unnecessary, and very expensive, trip to the emergency room.
One big problem with these apps: A lot of people don't know they exist. Teaming up with three huge employers could raise awareness.
""Amazon wants to create healthcare coverage for its employees that starts with technology… telemedicine fits that bill to the T,"" said Roy Schoenberg, chief executive at American Well, a company that offers telemedicine services to employers. 
Other companies that will likely benefit from Amazon's moves in health care are consumer-focused tools that help people find available doctors, book appointments, and get advice on paying their medical bills. 
Some start-ups that fit the bill include ZocDoc, an Opentable-like service for health care that Bezos' investment fund made an early bet on; Amino Health, a consumer transparency tool; and Accolade, which works with self-insured employers to help their workers navigate their health insurance and deal with other issues. 
""The announcement this morning puts it in center stage and turns the lights on,"" said  Schoenberg. ""Bravo.""

 });The digital TV and video industry, including power-players Netflix and Amazon, is set to be worth $119.2 billion in 2022, up from $64 billion in 2017, according to new figures.
 North America and Western Europe are set to dominate the growth in revenues of the ""over-the-top"" (OTT) providers of digital TV, with China and the Far East not far behind, according to a report by consultancy Juniper. The Americas will take 33.5 percent of revenues, with Europe taking 31.7 percent.
Digital TV players' budgets are set to dwarf some of their pay-TV competitors', with Netflix set to spend between $7.5 billion and $8 billion on content this year, according to its latest earnings. ""Game of Thrones"" producer HBO spent $2.5 billion in 2017, while Facebook and Apple both said they would spend $1 billion on original content last year.
 At the same time, ""cord-cutting,"" where people cancel their cable TV subscriptions, is likely to be driven by a switch to digital services between 2017 and 2022. ""Throughout the period, subscription video-on-demand will gain ground, not only because of new service launches across the globe, but also due to a consumer switch to the idea of 'skinny bundles', or slimmed down packages which will, in some cases, mean cable companies' customers cancel their packages,"" Juniper's report stated.

 Facebook's news feed change will be huge for Twitter: Former Twitter CEO   
 12:18  PM ET Fri, 26 Jan 2018 |  03:43 
 While Facebook has recently announced changes to its news feed, meaning that content from friends is prioritized over publisher and advertiser content, live video posts are set to increase, which is an opportunity for brands.
""This content will increasingly be of interest to advertisers, especially in view of Facebook's monthly active user base of over 2 billion people. The company has launched an app and website called Facebook for Creators to help users refine video content and generate viewership,"" Juniper's Lauren Foye said in an emailed statement.
Facebook's new video tab Watch, which works rather like YouTube, will also generate further ad dollars for the social network.
Advertising spend against online video is set to grow by 130 percent to $37 billion in 2022, up from $16 billion in 2017, according to Juniper's estimates and the number of people watching video online is set to hit 4.5 billion worldwide.

97,2018-01-31,Anthem earnings beat lifts health insurer stocks  The biggest threat to Alphabet isn't Apple or Facebook — It's Amazon  Apple could be the best of the bunch in this tech earnings avalanche  Now is the time to fight: What healthcare can learn from retail’s battles against Amazon  The Amazon-ification of car buying  ,"Gus Ruelas | Reuters
 Better-than-expected earnings from Anthem helped lift shares of health insurers Wednesday, one day after investors were spooked by a new initiative from Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan to combat rising employer health-care costs.
 Anthem shares rose to a historic high of $267.95, after the health insurer reported fourth-quarter profits of $1.29 per share, 2 cents above the Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. Revenue of $22.45 billion also topped expectations. Anthem closed Wednesday at $247.85, up 1.8 percent. 
Among the highlights of the quarter, Anthem's Affordable Care Act exchange business produced a surprise profit for 2017, despite an uptick in flu cases late last year.
 ""The claims experienced in our Individual ACA-compliant business was better-than-expected during the fourth quarter,"" said CEO Gail Boudreaux on the company's earnings call. ""As a result, our business was slightly profitable during the year, better than the relatively breakeven performance we had expected.""  The nation's second largest insurer pulled back sharply from the Obamacare exchanges for 2018, citing market upheaval and potential losses, and it still expects its exchange membership to decline by 70 percent.
Anthem raised its profit forecast for 2018, saying it now expects to earn more than $15.00 per share, attributing $2.00 per share to tax reform. The company says it plans to return half of the windfall to shareholders, another 25 percent to members in the form of rebates, and reinvest another 25 percent into the business.
While the subject of the new Amazon-led alliance never came up during the earnings call, Boudreaux said technology will be among the key areas of investments – something the tech giant and its partners emphasized that they want in order to simplify insurance benefits for their employees.
""We're investing in new digital and mobile capabilities to drive greater automation and enhance our consumer experience,"" said Boudreaux, who noted that the company had gained market share in the large employer market this year. ""This includes developing new external-facing applications and portals that will make it easier for members, agents and care providers to conduct business with Anthem.""
Shares of the major insurers, which sell plans to large employers fell more than 4 percent on average Tuesday, in the wake of the Amazon-Berkshire-JP Morgan announcement.
Analysts at Evercore ISI said they don't expect the new three-company venture will pose as big a threat to insurers as some investors feared, writing in a note to clients ""it is unlikely to cut them out completely or end up competing with them directly given barriers to forming national provider networks and industry's ongoing vertical consolidation – and instead any new solutions could complement or even be developed in partnership with (insurers).""
Even with Tuesday's pullback, the health insurance sector gained more than 7 percent for the month of January, the best start to the year for the major insurers since 2011.

 Biggest names in tech to report earnings. But are any of the stocks worth a buy?   
 4:25  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  03:11 
 Brace yourself for a tech earnings wave over the next two days as some of the biggest names on Wall Street open their books to scrutiny.
 Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet all report this week. The five companies make up more than 40 percent of the Nasdaq 100.
Piper Jaffray's Craig Johnson has sifted through the bunch and picked one he thinks has the best potential: Apple.
 ""Clearly it's a great company,"" Johnson told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday. ""It hasn't gotten as extended as what we've seen with other companies in the tech landscape.""
Apple has endured a sharp pullback this year, siloed off from a broader market rally that lifted the S&P 500 to new records this year. Its shares slumped 4 percent last week, its worst performance since September, after several reports of weaker iPhone demand in recent months. Apple's signature smartphone is the largest contributor to sales.
Its recent decline has pulled its price-to-earnings ratio back below 15 to trade at 14.2 times forward earnings this week, its lowest level since October. By comparison, the Technology Select Sector ETF trades at 18.9 times forward earnings and the S&P 500 18.6 times forward earnings.
Compare Apple to some of the darlings of the tech space. The FANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet — trade at a far higher premium relative to earnings. Amazon holds the highest P/E at an eye-popping 168 times forward earnings and Alphabet the lowest at 28 times.
""They've all gotten fairly extended, a lot of the charts are starting to look a bit parabolic, almost going straight up,"" Johnson said of the general tech rally.
Tech gains carried the market in 2017. Facebook ended the year with its second-best annual performance since going public in 2013; earnings beats and a surprise purchase of Whole Foods fueled Amazon's 56 percent; steady subscriber growth helped Netflix add 55 percent; and Google rose 33 percent in its third straight year of gains. The XLK Tech ETF rallied 32 percent in 2017, exceeding the S&P 500's 19 percent gain.
For Michael Bapis, managing director at HighTower Advisors' Bapis Group, any gains for the rest of the tech sector will stem from product innovation in the last quarter and beyond.
""Reinventing yourself in today's technology world is one of the crucial components to earnings releases,"" he said on ""Trading Nation."" ""What's the next product they're developing? I think at the beginning of the year coming out, they should be focused on certain technologies that maybe no one is.""
For example, Bapis is keeping an eye on Microsoft for any announcements tied to new gaming or blockchain technology. Microsoft is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell Wednesday, as do eBay, Microsoft, PayPal, Qualcomm and Symantec.
Thursday's session is just as busy: Alibaba is before the opening bell, and Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and GoPro report after the closing.
Correction: An earlier version misstated when Alibaba reports earnings. It is before the opening bell on Thursday.

 Amazon's announced partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase is a clear signal that ""The Everything Store"" is serious about entering the healthcare space. The combination of best-in-breed brands in e-commerce, underwriting and consumer finance should be perceived as a bid to become a dominant player.
 For healthcare incumbents, there is no more time for watching, waiting, or preserving the status quo. The barbarians are at the gate, and they'll need to choose a stance.
Most will gravitate to one of three strategies: hide, merge, or fight. In corporate speak, they might call this focus on core competencies, vertical integration, or digital innovation. Organizations that use these buzzwords would be wise to study how retail incumbents fared deploying each of these strategies in their battles against Amazon over the past decade.
 Borders told themselves that online and offline were completely separate channels, doubled down on their core competency of brick and mortar, and did not invest in online. As it turned out, while offline and online are completely different for the retailer, one can stand in for the other for the consumer. Borders declared bankruptcy in 2006, and ceased operations in 2011. Kmart and Sears took a different approach, teaming up against the common enemy. Scale, however, wasn't why they were losing customers in the first place, and more scale doesn't protect an inferior offering. Sears has lost 98% of its market capitalization since 2007.
The most successful incumbent is Walmart. It decided to fight fire with fire. But like other retailers, it started with a flawed strategy. 
Walmart's initial answer to Amazon was building an in-house digital team. This was an attempt to innovate by leveraging synergies with its existing operations and retrofitting its culture for a new world. This failed approach likely cost the company billions of dollars, and worse, nine years, before Walmart admitted it needed a new approach.
Why the perseverance in failure for nearly a decade? The in-house fallacy.
It is not yet in behavioral economics textbooks, but it appears to be an anthropological constant that leaders overvalue their hard-won experience, capabilities, and assets in the face of innovative disruption. Paradoxically, the attributes that make these companies impressive operators – process orientation, automation, error minimization – make them abysmal innovators.
For example, Walmart focused on leveraging its existing distribution system, which was optimized toward delivering truckloads of merchandise to their stores. At the same time, the real opportunity – which Amazon quickly mastered – was learning to pick and pack small orders and ship them direct to consumers. All too often, incumbents' assets drag them down while new entrants are unencumbered by obsolete notions.
For Walmart, the story has taken a turn for the better. They ultimately shuttered their home-grown web team and acquired digital native Jet.com. Notably, they've gone to great lengths to preserve Jet's most valuable assets: its culture, speed, and agility. Since the $3 billion acquisition in 2016, Walmart's market cap has risen by $100 billion.
So, should incumbents in all industries follow this example? Not necessarily. Acquisitions have a high failure rate, and frequently don't deliver the strategic value they promise. However, Walmart was running out of options and time. It ignored the sunk cost fallacy, pivoted quickly, and executed admirably on their plan B. As a result, Walmart is well positioned to stay in the ring and compete with Amazon.
I have worked in both healthcare and technology, observing decades of health giants over-promising on innovation, but under-delivering time and again. Incumbents can learn critical lessons from Walmart's playbook. Here are three simple principles to guide them:
 Meet on their turf, not yours: it is a critical mistake to assume that regulatory barriers, scale, or vertical integration keeps technology at bay. Look no further than hotels versus Airbnb, taxis versus Uber, or Kmart versus Amazon. Sure, a merger can buy you time. But ultimately, you have to meet your customer where they are, and that's increasingly online -- the digital battlefield. Best-of-breed, not ownership: The Amazon coalition itself is the best example of resisting the in-house fallacy, and instead harnessing the expertise of specialized standouts. In my conversations with healthcare executives about digital strategies, too often they point to an in-house team providing a good-enough solution. Online, when infinite options are just a click away, there is no such thing as good enough. Over time, consumers will gravitate to the best solution, and there is no second place. The right response is to team up with a player that's best-of-breed. Scale over margins: Amazon's success is in large part due to its willingness to accept razor-thin margins in exchange for market share. This is terrible news for businesses that are addicted to operating in high-margin environments. The good news is that technology loves scale – the more technology-enabled your business is, the better this strategy will work. 
Consumers should look forward to Amazon entering healthcare. Nearly certainly, it'll lead to lower prices and more convenience.
But in healthcare, more than other industries, choice can be a matter of life and death, and a single dominant player would be a terrible outcome for patients. Let's hope the healthcare incumbents learn the lessons of their retail brethren: those who act fast will have a fighting chance to stave off threats from the Amazon coalition. If they play it right, they should have every chance to compete successfully. Patients are counting on it.

Gong Xiangyang, left, head of the radiology department at Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital, watching outside of a CT scanning room. The personal investment fund of the Alibaba founder Jack Ma has invested in a company working with the hospital to use artificial intelligence in lung screenings.
 Amazon and two other American titans are trying to  shake up health care by experimenting with their own employees' coverage. By Chinese standards, they're behind the curve.
Technology companies like Alibaba and Tencent have made health care a priority for years, and are using China as their laboratory. After testing online medical advice and drug tracking systems, they are now focused on a more advanced tool: artificial intelligence.
Their aggressive push underscores the differences between the health care systems in China and the United States.
 Chinese hospitals are overburdened, with just 1.5 doctors for every 1,000 people — barely half the figure in the United States. Along with a rapidly aging population, China also has the largest number of obese children in the world, as fwell as more diabetes patients than anywhere else.
The companies' technological push is encouraged by the government. Beijing has said it  wants to be a leader in A.I. by 2030 and pledged to take on the United States in the field. While officials have emphasized the use of artificial intelligence in areas like defense and self-driving cars, they have also aggressively promoted its use in health care.
Alibaba and Tencent, which already dominate China's e-commerce and mobile payments sectors, are at the forefront. Among their goals: building diagnostic tools that will make doctors more efficient.
More from the New York Times: Mueller Zooms In on Trump Tower Cover Story  Facebook Aims to Soothe Wall Street Over News Feed Changes  Worries Grow That the Price of Bitcoin Is Being Propped Up  Amazon and its partners, JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway,  see technology as a way to provide simplified, affordable medical services. Although the alliance is still in the  early stages, it could create online services for medical advice or use its overall heft to negotiate for lower drug prices.
""It's fair to say that across the board, the Chinese tech companies have all embraced being involved in and being active in the healthcare space, unlike the U.S., where some of them have and some have not,"" said Laura Nelson Carney, an Asia-Pacific health care analyst at Bernstein Research.
""Few of them have made moves as big as in China,"" Ms. Carney said, referring to Alibaba and Tencent's American rivals.
Those big moves have had varying degrees of success.
In 2014, Alibaba announced a ""future hospital"" plan intended to make treatment more efficient by allowing patients to consult with doctors online and order drugs via the internet. But two years later, Chinese regulators stopped the sale of over-the-counter drugs on Tmall, Alibaba's e-commerce website. They also suspended a drug-monitoring system that the company had created. And last year, the search engine company Baidu scrapped its internet health care service, which allowed patients to book doctors appointments through an app, in a bid to focus solely on A.I.
But some of the more recent initiatives have made inroads. Last year, Alibaba's health unit introduced A.I. software that can help interpret CT scans and an A.I. medical lab to help doctors make diagnoses. About a month later, Tencent unveiled Miying, a medical imaging program that helps doctors detect early signs of cancer, in the southwestern region of Guangxi. It is now used in nearly 100 hospitals across China.
Tencent has also invested in WeDoctor Group, which has opened its own take on Alibaba's ""future hospital"" in northwestern China. The service allows patients to video chat with doctors and fill their prescriptions online.
Advances in artificial intelligence have already been transformative for China's overworked doctors.
Dr. Yu Weihong, an ophthalmologist at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said she used to take up to two days to analyze a patient's eyes by scrutinizing grainy images before discussing her findings with colleagues and writing up a report. Artificial intelligence software currently being tested by the hospital helps her do all that dramatically faster.
""Now, you don't even need a minute,"" she said.
The software has been developed by VoxelCloud, a start-up has raised about $28.5 million from companies including Tencent and the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Sequoia Capital. It specializes in automated medical image analysis, helping eye doctors like Dr. Yu screen patients for diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among China's working-age population.
There are just 20 eye doctors for every million people here, a third of the proportion in the United States. In April, Beijing announced an ambitious plan for the country's 110 million diabetics to undergo eye tests.
""It's impossible for one person to read that many images,"" said Dr. Yu.
Ding Xiaowei, whose grandparents were doctors, founded VoxelCloud in 2016, three months after completing his doctorate in computer science at U.C.L.A. The company, which has offices in Los Angeles and the Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou, is awaiting the green light from China's version of the F.D.A. for five diagnostic tools for CT scans and retina disease.
The sheer size of China's population — nearly 1.4 billion people who could provide a vast number of images to feed into their systems — provides a potential advantage for the development of artificial intelligence. Also helping: China has fewer concerns about privacy, allowing for easier collection of data that could result in smarter and more efficient A.I. systems. Regulation here isn't as strict as in the United States, either.
In all, more than 130 companies are applying A.I. in ways that could increase the efficiency of China's health care system, according to Yiou Intelligence, an industry consultancy based in Beijing. They range from behemoths like Alibaba and Tencent to domestic champions iFlyTek, which invented a robot that passed a Chinese medical licensing exam, and an array of smaller start-ups.
Money is flowing in. As of last August, venture capitalists such as Sequoia and Matrix Partners had invested at least $2.7 billion in such businesses, according to Yiou. Analysts at Bernstein estimated that spending in China's health tech industry will reach $150 billion by 2020.
Behind this push is a realization that the country's health care system is in crisis. With no functioning primary care system, patients flock to hospitals in major cities, sometimes camping out overnight just to get treatment for a fever. Doctors are overworked, and reports of stabbings and assaults by frustrated patients and their relatives are not uncommon.
Yunfeng, the personal investment fund of the Alibaba founder Jack Ma, has invested in one company, Yitu, that hopes to address the shortfall of resources. Yitu is working with Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, the best medical facility in eastern Zhejiang province, to develop software that automates the identification of early stages of lung cancer.
While it initially focused on facial recognition, Yitu has branched out into more complex image-recognition challenges, like cancer scans. Lin Chenxi, who left Alibaba to establish the company in 2012, said he hoped to use the technology to ensure equal access to medical treatment across China.
""In China, medical resources are very scarce and unequally distributed so that the top resources are concentrated in provincial capitals,"" he said. ""With this system, if it can be used at hospitals in rural cities, then it will make the medical experience much better.""
Trying to identify cancer nodes — shifting black-and-white splotches that look something like a Rorschach test — is grueling work, and China's doctors have far less time and resources than their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere. Gong Xiangyang, the head of the hospital's radiology department, likened the process to a factory, where burnout and mistakes from overwork can happen.
""We have to deal with a vast amount of medical images everyday,"" he said. ""So we welcome technology if it can relieve the pressure while boosting efficiency and accuracy.""

 Amazon had a blowout fourth quarter earnings report on Thursday, and part of it has to with its advertising business, according to CFO Brian Olsavsky.
 In a call with analysts on Thursday, Olsavsky said advertising was a ""key contributor"" to Amazon's North American sales growth, and pointed out how ads on the site are helpful to both customers and sellers on Amazon.
""Advertising was also a key contributor as we're continuing to make the offerings more valuable, both to customers and advertisers alike,"" he said.
 Amazon's advertising business has long been considered a sleeping giant for the e-commerce company because of the vast amount of shopping data it owns. Amazon can leverage actual shopping data to help the sellers target customers that have a higher chance of buying online.
Olsavsky went on to explain how exactly ads on Amazon's site improve the shopping and selling experience on Amazon.
""Our strategy is to make the customer experience additive by the ad process,"" Olsavsky said. ""We want customers to be able to see new brands and have an easier time discovering products that they're looking for. For brands, we think the value proposition is that we can find ways for them, especially emerging brands, to reach new customers.""
Amazon doesn't break out the sales of its advertising business. Instead, it loops it under the ""other"" category, which is mostly comprised of ad revenue. In the fourth quarter, other revenue grew 62 percent year-over-year to $1.7 billion.
Investors have grown bullish on Amazon's ad unit lately, as the company has beefed up its advertising offering. Morgan Stanley recently published a note forecasting almost $8 billion in revenue by 2019.
""We're definitely seeing some strong growth in our advertising revenues,"" Olsavsky said. ""We're going to keep building more and new tools based on what we're learning from our customers there to better serve in the future.""

Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy speaks at the 2017 AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas.
 Amazon's cloud business generated more revenue than analysts expected in the fourth quarter, with sales surging 45 percent. 
 The financial results strengthen the case that Amazon Web Services has grown into a cash machine for its parent company, while Alibaba, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Oracle all try to catch up. 
AWS captured $5.11 billion in revenue in the quarter and $17.46 billion in all of 2017, Amazon said in its quarterly earnings statement on Thursday. Analysts on average expected $4.97 billion, according to FactSet.
 AWS now has a revenue run rate of over $20 billion, CFO Brian Olsavsky said during Amazon's conference call with analysts after the earnings release.  
Operating income at AWS rose to $1.35 billion for the quarter, topping the FactSet estimate of $1.27 billion.  
 Almost a dozen years after becoming available, AWS has come to be a significant contributor to its parent company. In the fourth quarter of 2014, almost 5 percent of Amazon's revenue came from AWS. In the fourth quarter of 2017, that figure was about 8.5 percent. Across all of 2017, approximately 10 percent of Amazon's revenue resulted from AWS.  
""There are few enterprise franchises that are operating at an annual run rate approaching $20B in scale yet still delivering high growth in excess of 40 percent,"" KeyBanc analysts led by Edward Yruma wrote in a Jan. 28 note.
But in addition to developing its revenue capability, AWS has also been gradually delivering more and more operating income to Amazon, which provides capital for additional investments, especially outside North America. In the fourth quarter AWS operating income equated to more than 60 percent of the operating income for the entirety of Amazon.
In the quarter, AWS launched services for translation and transcription, revealed a camera for developers that's capable of doing artificial intelligence computations, and announced data centers just for U.S. intelligence agencies. In November AWS CEO Andy Jassy boasted that the public cloud now offers customers more than a hundred services.

David Einhorn
 David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital missed out on the best January for stock investors in two decades. 
 Greenlight Capital Offshore declined 6 percent in January, while the Greenlight Capital LP fund dropped 6.6 percent, according to a source familiar with the returns.
 The S&P 500 rose 5.6 percent last month, marking its best January performance since 1997. January's gain was also the best month for the S&P 500 since March 2016. 
 A source told CNBC the fund manager said to investors that many of the firm's bets against companies rose by 15 percent or more, outperforming its long positions. Einhorn also said most of the fund's underperformance occurred in the last week of January.
The weak monthly return followed Einhorn's poor performance last year. Greenlight Capital returned a meager 1.6 percent in 2017 versus a 19.4 percent gain for the S&P 500, according to an investor letter.
The fund manager has already lamented over his bearish bets on stocks last year. Shorting is a trading strategy where investors borrow and sell shares in hopes of buying them back at a profit after a drop.
""The biggest losers for the year were our short positions on the 'bubble basket' and Caterpillar,"" he wrote in his annual letter to clients on Jan. 16. ""It's tough to look at full year losses on Amazon (+56%), athenahealth (+26%), Netflix (+55%) and Tesla (+46%) when we believe all those stocks appeared priced with little margin for error entering the year, and none executed well or met fundamental expectations in 2017.""
If Einhorn didn't exit those positions, the same basket of stocks likely contributed to the fund's losses in January.
Amazon rose 24 percent, athenahealth dropped 6 percent, Netflix rallied 41 percent and Tesla gained 14 percent in the first month of 2018.
A Greenlight spokesperson declined to comment.

 Cigna CEO: Aim to be undisputed partner of choice   
 12:21  PM ET Thu,  1 Feb 2018 |  03:38 
 Cigna CEO David Cordani said he's confident the insurer will get a piece of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and J.P. Morgan's new health initiative to tackle health costs, but investors aren't convinced.
 Cigna shares fell as much as 4 percent in trading Thursday and were recently down more than 2.5 percent for the day and about 10 percent for the week.
On Tuesday, J.P. Morgan and its partners announced plans to form a venture aimed at lowering its employee health costs. Since then, investors have been concerned that Cigna will be squeezed on pricing for its services or lose business. The company currently insures about 20 percent of J.P. Morgan's employees.
 ""We're one of J.P. Morgan's service partners, so we have ongoing dialogue with J.P. Morgan on a regular basis,"" including this week, said Cordani in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
""We do see this as an opportunity, and we're in the middle of that conversation, as you would expect,"" he said. 
The three large employers said this week that they are hoping to form a separate entity to handle benefits ""free from profitmaking incentives,"" in order to lower health costs and improve service for their workers. Cordani pushed back on the profit implications on the company's earnings conference call.
""We should not view that an industry with medical cost trend (growth) of 5-6-7 percent as sustainable,"" said Cordani, while pushing back on the notion that insurer profits drive those increases.
""Our industry is capital intensive ... This is not going to get solved with extracting a couple of points out of the (profit) margin,"" he said.
Cigna reported fourth-quarter adjusted profits of $1.94 per share, 5 cents above consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters. Revenue of $10.5 billion also topped expectations, driven by strong growth in premiums and fees. Cigna executives highlighted the company's ability to contain medical cost growth to 3 percent on its employer plans last year, well below the industry trend of 5 to 6 percent annual growth.
The executives cited that stat as one of the things, along with the emphasis on integrated care for chronic conditions, as putting them in a strong position to be a partner for the new Amazon-led initiative.
""Clearly (it's) a disruptive headline, and clearly a need of creating clarity in terms of next steps. I think the question fundamentally for everybody in the space is can you grow, can you innovate and can you continue to provide strong value,"" Cordani said.
The company raised its outlook for 2018, to $12.40-$12.90 per share, based in part on tax reform. The firm said it will use $15 million of the tax windfall to raise its minimum wage for front-line employees to $16 an hour, and $30 million to boost contributions to workers' 401(k) accounts.
Cigna executives said their individual Obamacare market plans made a small profit in 2017; rival Anthem reported similar stabilization in their individual exchange business.

 Amazon's Jeff Bezos: Expect Amazon to double down   
 4:51  PM ET Thu,  1 Feb 2018 |  01:21 
 Jeff Bezos is giddy about Alexa.
 ""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic,"" the Amazon CEO said in the company's fourth-quarter earnings release on Thursday. ""We don't see surprises of this magnitude very often -- expect us to double down.""
After announcing after Christmas that it sold ""tens of millions"" of voice-powered Alexa devices over the holidays, Amazon provided extensive details about just how widely it's using the technology and mentioned Alexa 19 times in the press release. 
 The company said that the Alexa Skills store offers over 30,000 skills, including tools for gamers, and that customers can use Alexa to control more than 4,000 devices. New skills include content like beauty podcasts, game shows, and a quiz from the History Channel.
Alexa technology is being used in computers from companies including HP and Lenovo, and more tools have been released so third-party developers can add Alexa to their apps. Amazon Web Services also launched Alexa for Business, letting employees link it into their corporate systems for finding an open conference room, making phone calls, or managing to-do lists.  
Currently, on Amazon.com, the five most popular electronic devices are all Amazon products powered by Alexa. They include the Fire TV Stick and three Echo devices. 
Alphabet, which has developed rival technology to Alexa, also released results on Thursday. In its press release, the company didn't mention Google Home or Assistant, the technology that powers it.
However, in the earnings call with analysts, CEO Sundar Pichai said that Google's voice technology is gaining strong adoption in countries like India and is ""actually an important part of the mobile search craze.""

 Cramer tackles Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet earnings   
 6:26  PM ET Thu,  1 Feb 2018 |  01:42 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer has noticed a pattern of ""downward bias"" among investors in the stock market.
 ""I'm talking about the notion that a slowdown lurks around every corner, as people thought would be the case with Apple tonight, or that pricing is going to get worse, a fret about Alphabet, or demand is about to taper off, the whisper that drove down the stock of Amazon in [the] late afternoon,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Did you know that none of these happen to be the case?""
""So many supposed experts and analysts keep giving you second-rate, or even just plain wrong, information,"" Cramer continued. ""They're used to things going bad for so many years and they just can't shake the prejudice even when everything is, arguably, coming up roses.""
 So, to make sure investors got a more comprehensive look at one of the market's most hotly contested sectors, technology, Cramer dove into the earnings reports from Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple after the giants delivered their quarterly results.
 Facebook
 On Wednesday, Facebook reported an earnings beat, but the stock seesawed as investors balked at the company's core website revamp.
Despite the fact that the social media colossus reported a 48 percent rise in advertising and forecast a strong growth story, the narrative that it was losing total user time on its platform because of the overhaul reigned supreme.
Cramer pointed out that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had prepared Wall Street for the trade-off ahead of the report, saying that the decline in hours would come hand-in-hand with fixes to the user experience.
""A lot of these negative commentators say things like, 'The daily user trend's bad news.' But Facebook told us point-blank that it doesn't expect to see any sort of long-term slowdown in daily active user growth,"" Cramer said.
Moreover, the actual improvements will reduce the number of advertisements and viral content on Facebook. The company's Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said on the post-earnings conference call that they could lead to ""more monetization opportunities"" — music to Cramer's ears.
""A better user experience does translate to more users, which translates into, guess what? More money,"" the ""Mad Money"" host explained. ""The truth is, there's no immutable law of the universe that says things have to go wrong.""
 Apple
 Cramer saw similar negativity seeping into the market narrative after Apple reported what he saw as ""a phenomenal quarter.""
Knowing that tech hawks were worried about its iPhone production, the company gave positive guidance on its next quarter, predicting steady demand and strong pricing.
""The bear case, once again, failed to pan out, particularly with all the money [Apple's] got and what they're going to do with it, and it was right to hold it, not trade it, at least for now,"" Cramer said.
 Amazon
 The e-commerce giant's quarter gave investors everything they could have wanted from its retail, web service and advertising lines of business, the ""Mad Money"" host said
""I think its stock can romp now from the $1470s, where we're going to be when we're going home tonight, to the $1500s in a short period of time. I'd be a buyer anywhere below $1500,"" Cramer said.
 Alphabet
 Alphabet delivered what was perhaps the most mixed quarter of the bunch, but Cramer still believed in the Google parent's story despite its weaker-than-expected results.
""I was a tad disappointed, but then again, it had run up so much in anticipation of a blowout quarter that there was a letdown for certain,"" Cramer said. ""My take? Don't lose hope, don't lose sleep, it's doing well.""
 Final thoughts
 ""If you don't want to miss these moves, you need to stop assuming that the default state is for everything to be horrible,"" Cramer concluded. ""Sometimes, I almost feel like it's my job to be upbeat. But the reality is that I am not being upbeat. I'm merely being empirical. I'm telling you the facts. This is not a glass-half-full, glass-half-empty situation. The glass, to me, is overflowing and anyone who tries to tell you different, I think, is simply being rigorous or worse, quite disingenuous.""

 Check out the companies making headlines after the bell Thursday: 
 Apple stock climbed more than 3 percent in extended trading. The technology giant beat analyst projections on top and bottom lines, reporting first quarter earnings per share of $3.89 on revenue of $88.3 billion.
But Apple under-performed on one key metric: iPhone sales. Apple reported selling 77.3 million units, missing the 80 million mark, anticipated by Wall Street. In the year-ago quarter, Apple sold 77 million units.
 Shares of Amazon jumped more than 6 percent in the extended session. The e-commerce and cloud computing company reported strong earnings and revenue on Thursday. Amazon reported $3.75 EPS on $60.5 billion in revenue.
Amazon's cloud subsidiary Amazon Web Services surpassed analyst expectations on revenue, and is forecast to continue growing at a 40 percent pace, despite intensifying competition from Microsoft and Google.
Alphabet stock tanked after the bell, losing 4.5 percent before recovering slightly, down 2.6 percent. The multinational technology company announced mixed fourth quarter financial results, reporting earnings of $9.70 on revenue of $32.32 billion. Analysts were anticipating earnings per share of $9.98 on $31.86 billion in revenue.
Shares of Viacom shot up 1.5 percent in the extended session, after the media company announced it would explore plans to merge with CBS. In separate announcements, the two companies said their boards formed exploratory committees to discuss a merger, but that the talks were no guarantee of a deal.
The companies were split more than a decade ago by media mogul Sumner Redstone, although the Redstones still control both through a third, private company. 
CBS stock edged up 0.5 percent after the announcement.
Shares of Mattel plunged 7.7 percent in extended trading. The toy manufacturer announced holiday season sales that missed Wall Street expectations. Mattel reported weak demand for key brands, including Fisher-Price and American Girl. Residual effects from the collapse of Toys R Us, also pulled on the struggling company during what should have been the most profitable time of the year.
GoPro stock lost more than 3 percent after the bell. The technology company reported fourth quarter earnings and revenue that missed analyst expectations, even after lowering revenue guidance to $340 million, earlier in January. GoPro reported loss per share of $0.30 on $334.8 million in revenue, missing projections of $0.11 loss per share on $340.1 million in revenue. 
Amgen shares dropped nearly 2 percent after the bell. The biopharmaceutical company just missed Wall Street expectations on top and bottom lines for the fourth quarter. Amgen reported earnings per share of $2.89 on revenue of $5.8 billion, versus the $3.03 EPS on $5.83 billion in revenue expected.

Here are the most important numbers:
 Revenue: $60.5 billion vs. $59.83 billion, as estimated, according to Thomson Reuters EPS: $3.75 per share* AWS revenue: $5.11 billion vs. $4.97 billion, as estimated, according to FactSet 
Amazon's revenue, which includes sales from Whole Foods, jumped 38 percent year-over-year. Its North America revenue jumped 42 percent to $37 billion, while international sales grew 29 percent to $18 billion.
In a call with analysts, Amazon's CFO Brian Olsavsky credited record order volume and improved warehouse efficiency during the busy holiday shopping season for the successful quarter. He also pointed out AWS's continued expansion and said the advertising business was a ""key contributor"" in North American revenue growth.
Net income was $1.9 billion, more than double from the same period of last year and the highest in company history. Amazon noted that the fourth quarter earnings includes a tax benefit of roughly $789 million due to the change in U.S. tax code.
Amazon's cloud unit, AWS, continued to be the growth driver of the company. For the quarter, AWS sales jumped 45 percent year-over-year, while generating $1.3 billion in operating income, a whopping 64 percent share of Amazon's total operating income.
In a statement, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos touted the success of Amazon's voice-controlled technology Alexa and hinted that the company would invest more in the space.
""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them. We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down,"" Bezos said.
First quarter revenue guidance came in the range of $47.75 billion to $50.75 billion, above street estimates of $48.6 billion. But operating income guidance was between $300 million to $1 billion, below the $1.5 billion street consensus, likely indicating heavier investments going forward.
Amazon has been in heavy investment mode in recent quarters, pouring money into warehouse and data center expansion, while adding more video content for its Prime Video offering. Its total costs jumped 38 percent in the fourth quarter year-over-year, to $58 billion, a significant jump from the 23 percent cost increase between the fourth quarter of 2015 and 2016.
Physical stores revenue, which primarily comes from Whole Foods, came in at $4.5 billion. This is the first full quarter to have Whole Foods revenue included in Amazon's sales, and Olsavsky said the company's ""very happy"" with the initial results of the grocery chain.
For the full year, Amazon had $177.9 billion in sales, up 31 percent from the previous year's $136 billion. Still, the company continued to invest in its business, resulting in a 2 percent drop in its operating profit to $4.1 billion.
Amazon stock is up more than 70 percent over the past year, and hit the $700 billion market cap milestone for the first time this week.
*Correction: Amazon's EPS number is not comparable against earnings estimates because of the tax benefits the company saw due to changes in the U.S. tax code.

 Fed's Kashkari says Amazon's HQ2 winner will lose   
 9:10  AM ET Fri,  2 Feb 2018 |  00:29 
 The city Amazon ultimately chooses for its $5 billion, 50,000-worker second headquarters may end up paying too high of a price compared with the economic benefit that the project would bring, said Neel Kashkari, a top official at the Treasury Department during the 2008 financial crisis.
 Kashkari, currently president of the Federal Reserve of Minneapolis, told CNBC on Friday he was thrilled when he learned his city was not among the 20 Amazon HQ2 finalists.
""When I heard that Minneapolis was not on the short list, my research director said to me, 'We dodged a bullet,'"" said Kashkari, who said he thinks Amazon founder and world's richest man Jeff Bezos ""knows exactly where he wants to put his second headquarters.""
 But Kashkari said he believes Bezos wants to get the best deal possible by getting the cities to undercut each other with concessions. ""He's getting all the cities to compete on who can write the biggest check so that he can get the location he wants and the biggest subsidy from taxpayers.""
Amazon did not immediately to respond to a request for comment.
Cities are usually willing to offer steep tax breaks and other generous subsidies to attract a development project on the scale of Amazon's second headquarters on the hope of a boost of economic activity.
But Kashkari contended that it's ""a money losing investment for taxpayers.""
""Let's see how big a check they write,"" he said.
In addition to his time at the Treasury and the Fed, Kashkari also unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for governor of California. He also worked at investment giant Pimco as a managing director and head of global equities and as a vice president at Goldman Sachs.

A worker stacks boxes inside of an Amazon fulfillment center in Robbinsville, New Jersey.
 As Amazon grows, its physical footprint is rapidly expanding through physical stores, massive warehouses and data centers.
 Amazon disclosed in its annual report on Friday that its physical properties — office space, physical stores, warehouses, and data centers — now span 253 million square feet, up 42 percent from the previous year.
Most of that space is leased, but the amount that it owns almost doubled in 2017 to 14 million square feet from 7.2 million a year earlier.
 Amazon has been heavily investing in warehouse expansion lately to meet growing demand for faster delivery. Having more warehouses across the country makes it easier and less costly to deliver products. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said the company added roughly 30 percent to its warehouse square footage in each of the past two years.
And that's all before Amazon gets started on the development of HQ2, or its second headquarters, which the company estimates will cost $5 billion to construct and bring in 50,000 ""high-paying jobs."" Last month Amazon narrowed the list of HQ2 candidates to 20 locations.
At the end of December, Amazon had 566,000 full-time and part-time employees, up 66 percent from 2016.

 Amazon HQ2 search: Newark, New Jersey vs. New York City   
 9:28  AM ET Mon, 29 Jan 2018 |  01:59 
 Amazon's physical growth in 2017 was faster than the previous two years, in part because of the acquisition of Whole Foods and its 472 stores. Amazon now leases more than 20 million square feet of space for physical stores. 
Capital expenditures in 2017 jumped to $10.1 billion from $6.7 billion in 2016. In addition to capacity for fulfillment center, Amazon said much of the growth was for technology infrastructure to support Amazon Web Services. More than 80 percent of Amazon's space consists of warehouses and data centers.
Total footprint growth of 42 percent last year marked an acceleration from 32 percent In 2016 and 18 percent in 2015.
Even with all that expansion, warehouse congestion remains a growing headache for Amazon. To help solve the problem, Amazon recently launched a new trial program called FBA Onsite, which lets Amazon get dedicated space within the seller's warehouse.

 Cramer's second take on Apple, Alphabet and Amazon after the sell-off   
 6:49  PM ET Fri,  2 Feb 2018 |  00:56 
 As the Dow Jones industrial average slid more than 660 points on Friday, CNBC's Jim Cramer gave investors a playbook for the tech giants that reported earnings on Thursday.
 ""A couple of perennial winners, Apple and Alphabet, have been transformed into what can only be called underdogs — maybe even losers — overnight, both stocks more than 4 percent today, while Amazon's become like the Patriots, with Jeff Bezos acting as the stock market version of Tom Brady,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
However, Super Bowl analogies aside, Cramer knew that investors were worried about what Friday's staggering decline meant for the technology names.
 But even with Friday's weakness, Cramer said most of the negative action stemmed from their quarterly earnings results.
 Apple
 In the last few months, Apple, which just reported its best quarter ever, fell victim to negative forward-looking estimates from analysts.
When management acknowledged that its estimates were too high, Apple's stock got slammed, sinking even more on Friday.
""I still say own it, don't trade it, but I've also been saying, and I reiterate, it hasn't bottomed yet,"" Cramer said.
 Alphabet
 Despite the fact that Alphabet delivered a strong fourth-quarter report, the Google parent's numbers evidently weren't enough for Wall Street.
""[Management] then gave you a kind of rest-on-their-laurels forecast that brought the stock back to earth and then some,"" Cramer said. ""Wait for more downside.""
 Amazon
 Cramer was most bullish on e-commerce giant Amazon after its latest quarter, which he said showed ""a trifecta of goodness:"" healthy retail sales numbers, a growing advertising business and a seemingly unbeatable web services segment.
""I know it was up nearly 40 points today. Guess what? It's a buy,"" Cramer argued. ""Amazon would've been up 100 if the tape weren't so ugly.""

 Old-economy investments are helping Berkshire Hathaway maintain its perch as the biggest non-tech U.S. company.
 A surge in the shares over the last year has pushed the Omaha conglomerate's market value above $500 billion, putting it in a race with Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook to be the first company to reach $1 trillion. It ranks sixth, behind those three as well as Apple and Microsoft, as it did at the start of last year.
Sure, the tech giants have dominated the markets in the last year, leading the S&P on a record-setting climb. But Warren Buffett's conglomerate of distinctly old-economy businesses like electric utilities, railroads, insurance companies and furniture and clothing retailers are perhaps the best positioned to benefit from tax cuts and an economic expansion, Berkshire investors and analysts said.
 Berkshire could potentially reap a $37 billion windfall from tax reform, according to an analysis last month by Barclays. And a growing economy is seen lifting profits for transportation, energy and consumer product companies: all in Berkshire's orbit.
""All eyes will be on the next earnings report,"" said David Rolfe, the chief investment officer of St. Louis-based Wedgewood Partners, a money management firm that has been a long-time Berkshire B share holder. Berkshire is scheduled to report fourth quarter and year-end 2017 earnings later this month.
Earlier this week Berkshire announced with Amazon and J. P. Morgan Chase that the three companies would team up to form an independent health care company for their U.S. employees, of which Berkshire has more than 350,000. Buffett has said that healthcare costs, not taxes, are the real issue affecting American business competitiveness.
Berkshire's A shares trade above $310,000, while the B shares are around $209, up 5.5 percent this year and 28 percent in the last 12 months. The S&P 500, by comparison, is up 3.3 percent and 21 percent, respectively.
Since the beginning of last year, Berkshire has added $130.7 billion to its market value, according to FactSet data through Thursday.
While Kraft Heinz, in which Berkshire took a stake in 2015 with the merger of Kraft and Heinz, fell about 8 percent last year and is down another 1 percent this year, the bull market lifted several of Berkshire's stock investments. Nearly all of the 46 stocks in the portfolio are up, most by double-digits. Only four, including Kraft Heinz shares, are down over 12 months.
Apple, which Berkshire started acquiring in 2016, is up 24.7 percent, and Bank of America, in which Berkshire became the largest shareholder last fall, is up 40.6 percent. A long-standing investment, American Express, is up 26 percent, and Moody's shares are up 51.9 percent.
""In a handful of holdings, he's had outsize performance,"" Rolfe said.
Berkshire has shed or scaled back on some old industrials that used to make up a hefty part of its stock holdings. It exited General Electric in the middle of last year and had been shedding its stake in International Business Machines, admitting to a flawed investment thesis. And Buffett has said he ""blew it"" by failing to invest in Google parent Alphabet and other tech high-flyers.
But some of Berkshire's more traditional holdings have boosted the portfolio. Airlines, which Buffett once avoided but added in 2016, are one example. American Airlines is up 18 percent, and Southwest is up nearly 11 percent in the last 12 months. Berkshire has 9.8 percent and an 8 percent stake the companies, respectively.
Shares of the materials company USG, in which Berkshire has a 27 percent stake, are up 15.9 percent over the last 12 months. Shares of Walmart are up 56.6 percent in the same period. Berkshire's stake in the retailer is less than 1 percent.
Questions about Berkshire's future management continue to be a major overhang, however, according to Meyer Shields, an analyst from Keefe Bruyette & Woods. Despite the boost Berkshire should get from tax cuts and a growing economy, ""at some point in time senior management will change. With someone as unique as Warren Buffett, their eventual departure is an issue.""
Last month, 87-year-old Buffett named two vice chairman for the company in an attempt to soothe succession concerns, though his departure is far from immediate. Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain, two of his top business lieutenants, take on the new role as Buffett and long-time associate Charlie Munger continue at the company as chairman and CEO and vice chairman, respectively.

Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos
 Amazon's stock received a slew of upgrades from Wall Street analysts on Friday after delivering market-beating earnings.
 On Thursday, the e-commerce giant reported fourth quarter revenues that beat expectations with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division helping to propel numbers.
Amazon shares closed at $1,390 on Thursday, but after hours shares popped over 5 percent.
 A number of analysts raised their price target for Amazon shares. Here are some of the biggest moves:
 Morgan Stanley raised its target to $1,500 from $1,400 Barclays upped its price target to $1,580 from $1,210 Credit Suisse raised its price target to $1,750 from $1,410 Mizuho raised its price target to $1,700 from $1,300 J.P. Morgan raised its price target to $1,650 from $1,385 Bank of America Merrill Lynch raised its price target to $1,650 from $1,460. 
Amazon forecast that its operating income for the first quarter of 2018 would be between $300 million to $1 billion, below the $1.5 billion street consensus, likely indicating heavier investments going forward. But this did not worry analysts.

 Is Amazon overvalued?   
 12:43  AM ET Fri,  2 Feb 2018 |  03:08 
 ""While profitability is taking a step back, we believe Amazon is once again investing ahead of growth in commerce and voice search,"" Mizuho said in a note announcing its price target upgrade.
Credit Suisse's target price of $1,750 is the highest of the latest round of upgrades. If realized, it would represent a near 26 percent increase from Thursday's closing price of $1,390.
But Credit Suisse is not the most bullish analyst on the Street. Last month, D.A. Davidson increased its price target for Amazon shares to $1,800 from $1,500.
""We see two potential catalysts for shares over the next 12-month period: stronger-than-expected operating results from the company's cloud computing efforts, which we believe remains the primary driver of its share price and, due to its increasing mix of highly-profitable third-party sales (which surpassed 50 percent for the first time in 2Q17),"" analyst Tom Forte wrote in a note to clients last month.
Amazon's cloud business continued to be its fastest-growing and most profitable in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, AWS sales jumped 45 percent year-on-year, while generating $1.3 billion in operating income, a whopping 64 percent share of Amazon's total operating income.
CEO Jeff Bezos also said Amazon would ""double down"" on its Alexa voice technology.
Analysts are extremely bullish on Amazon's stock in the long term, thanks to a number of factors.
""In a nutshell, Amazon remains one of our favorite secular tech growth stories for FY18... and these robust results and 2018 outlook support the Amazon consumer growth thesis, coupled by cloud strength on the AWS segment which is still in the early innings of playing out among enterprises globally on the secular cloud theme,"" Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, wrote in a note Thursday.

A man walks through light rain in front of the Hey Google booth under construction at the Las Vegas Convention Center in preparation for the 2018 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, January 8, 2018.
 Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is facing more business threats from Amazon, according to one Wall Street analyst.
 Stifel lowered its rating for Alphabet shares to hold from buy, citing the competition in the advertising and cloud computing markets.
""Alphabet continues to drive growth at scale through strength in mobile search, YouTube, and programmatic advertising, while investing in other key initiatives (cloud, hardware, AI) that should serve as growth levers in 2018 and beyond,"" analyst Scott Devitt wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""We are Hold rated on shares however given current valuation relative to historical ranges and highlight some potential longer-term concerns including: Amazon as the first entry point to product search; Google Cloud Platform market share; regulatory risk.""
 Alphabet reported fourth-quarter earnings results below expectations on Thursday due to rising expenses. Its shares declined 5.3 percent Friday.
Devitt maintained his $1,150 price target for Alphabet shares, representing 3 percent downside to Thursday's close.
The analyst said Amazon is a threat to Google's ad business. He noted more than half of US consumers use Amazon to search for products over the company's search engine.
""Amazon has grown its position as the first destination for consumer product searches,"" he wrote. ""This has the potential to cannibalize Google's revenue from retail advertisers.""
Devitt said Google has ""high single digit"" market share in the global cloud computing market compared to Amazon Web Services' more than 35 percent share.
Google's cloud computing business ""is playing from behind, but there remains significant opportunity,"" he wrote.
The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A worker stacks boxes inside of an Amazon fulfillment center in Robbinsville, New Jersey.
 What if your employer made you wear a wristband that tracked your every move, and that even nudged you via vibrations when it judged that you were doing something wrong?
What if your supervisor could identify every time you paused to scratch or fidget, and for how long you took a bathroom break?
What may sound like dystopian fiction could become a reality for Amazon warehouse workers around the world. The company has won  two patents for such a wristband, though it was unclear if Amazon planned to actually manufacture the tracking device and have employees wear it.
 The online retail giant, which plans to build a second headquarters and recently  shortlisted 20 potential host cities for it, has also been known to experiment in-house with new technology before selling it worldwide.
Amazon, which rarely discloses information on its patents, could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.
But the patent disclosure goes to the heart about a global debate about privacy and security. Amazon already has a reputation for a  workplace culture that thrives on a hard-hitting management style, and has experimented with how far it can push white-collar workers in order to reach its delivery targets.

 Privacy advocates, however, note that a lot can go wrong even with everyday tracking technology. On Monday, the tech industry was jolted by the discovery that Strava, a fitness app that allows users to track their activities and compare their performance with other people running or cycling in the same places, had unwittingly  highlighted the locations of United States military bases and the movements of their personnel in Iraq and Syria.
The patent applications, filed in 2016, were published in September, and Amazon won them this week, according to GeekWire, which reported the patents' publication on Tuesday.
In theory, Amazon's proposed technology would emit ultrasonic sound pulses and radio transmissions to track where an employee's hands were in relation to inventory bins, and provide ""haptic feedback"" to steer the worker toward the correct bin.
The aim, Amazon says in the patent, is to streamline ""time consuming"" tasks, like responding to orders and packaging them for speedy delivery. With guidance from a wristband, workers could fill orders faster.
Critics say such wristbands raise concerns about privacy and would add a new layer of surveillance to the workplace, and that the use of the devices could result in employees being treated more like robots than human beings.
Current and former Amazon employees said the company already used similar tracking technology in its warehouses and said they would not be surprised if it put the patents into practice.
Max Crawford, a former Amazon warehouse worker in Britain, said in a phone interview, ""After a year working on the floor, I felt like I had become a version of the robots I was working with.""
He described having to process hundreds of items in an hour — a pace so extreme that one day, he said, he fell over from dizziness.
""There was no time to go to the loo,"" he said, using the British slang for toilet. ""You had to process the items in seconds and then move on. If you didn't meet targets, you were fired.""
He worked back and forth at two Amazon warehouses for more than two years and then quit in 2015 because of health concerns, he said: ""I got burned out.""
Mr. Crawford agreed that the wristbands might save some time and labor, but he said the tracking was ""stalkerish"" and feared that workers might be unfairly scrutinized if their hands were found to be ""in the wrong place at the wrong time.""
""They want to turn people into machines,"" he said. ""The robotic technology isn't up to scratch yet, so until it is, they will use human robots.""
Many companies file patents for products that never see the light of day. And Amazon would not be the first employer to push boundaries in the search for a more efficient, speedy work force. Companies are increasingly introducing artificial intelligence into the workplace to help with productivity, and technology is often used to monitor employee whereabouts.
 One company in London is developing artificial intelligence systems to flag unusual workplace behavior, while another used a messaging application to track its employees.

 Amazon closed 2.8 percent lower, while Netflix declined 4.9 percent. Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook pulled back 5.1 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively. Apple closed 2.5 percent lower after briefly rising as much as 2.1 percent.
These stocks followed the broader U.S. stock market lower. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 1,100 points and the S&P 500 declined 4.1 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite pulled back 3.8 percent.
 Investors have poured loads of money into these stocks over the past year. In the past 12 months, these stocks have all soared at least 21 percent.
 Their gains have also been key in lifting the broader market to record highs over the past year. Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet, Facebook and Apple have all benefited from strong quarterly results in the past year.
Amazon shares surged earlier last week after it said fourth-quarter revenue jumped 38 percent, topping Wall Street estimates. And Amazon is universally liked on Wall Street with 34 analysts rating the stock buy and two giving it a hold, according to TipRanks.com. Zero analysts give it a sell. 
But none of that mattered Monday as investors looked to sell their biggest winners in order to raise capital amid the sell-off.

President Donald Trump listens to AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson during the 'American Leadership in Emerging Technology' event in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC on Thursday, June 22, 2017.
 President Donald Trump doesn't have a lot of friends in Silicon Valley. However, as his administration delays approving the AT&T-Time Warner merger, he is unintentionally making life much easier for the biggest technology companies. 
 The Justice Department's decision to sue to block the $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T has clogged up the future of the legacy media business as executives wait to see what's possible — and what isn't — in a Trump administration. Meanwhile, tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet's YouTube, and Facebook are free to spend billions on original content, buoyed by the rising growth that traditional media companies lack.
""For the first time, I don't understand what's possible regulatorily when it comes to horizontal integration or to vertical integration, and even whether or not behavioral remedies will be meaningful again,"" said Leo Hindery, managing partner of InterMedia Partners and the former CEO of both TCI and AT&T Broadband, once the largest U.S. cable company. ""There are now inconsistent strategies from company to company and people are stepping every day into each other's sandboxes.""
 The threat of tech giants moving in on traditional media businesses is one of the reasons Rupert Murdoch decided to sell $52.4 billion worth of 21st Century Fox assets to Disney in December, according to people familiar with the matter. That sale included Fox's movie studio, some cable channels and stakes in Sky, Endemol Shine Group and Hulu, as well as regional sports networks.

 Outlook for mergers and acquisitions market is robust going into 2018: Deutsche Bank   
 4:18  AM ET Fri, 15 Dec 2017 |  02:43 
 Murdoch is concerned the largest technology companies will outspend Fox and other TV-first programmers on new content and sports rights in the coming years, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Media companies are trying to respond by getting bigger and bulking up their balance sheets to compete.
Fox shelled out $3 billion for Thursday Night NFL rights for the next five years in a deal announced last week. The price to broadcast football games keeps rising even as NFL ratings have declined for the second consecutive season. That's because traditional TV programmers like Fox need must-see live content to differentiate from on-demand services such as Netflix, which is spending up to $8 billion on content next year alone.   
Access to sports and live events is also important to keep the cable-TV ecosystem relevant -- high-demand content drives cable's bundling strategy, where it sells large groups of channels together. Total U.S. households paying for cable or satellite TV could fall to 92 million in 2018, according to a UBS estimate, down 11 percent from 2012, when pay-TV households peaked at 103 million. 
The combined market valuations of the big legacy media companies like Comcast, Disney, Fox and Time Warner is about $500 billion. That collective number trails the individual market caps of Apple, Amazon and Facebook.
Apple's market valuation, by itself, is around $830 billion. Amazon's is approaching $700 billion. Facebook is around $550 billion. Netflix's market cap, which is around $115 billion, tops both Fox and Time Warner.
 A brake on other deals
 Blocking AT&T-Time Warner has put the brakes on a series of domino deals that would drastically consolidate the media landscape. 
If AT&T-Time Warner isn't allowed to proceed, Time Warner, which owns HBO, CNN, Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. studio, will almost certainly look for a new merger partner. AT&T will also be forced to alter its strategy of vertical integration.
It's conceivable Disney may not be allowed to buy Fox either, though Trump did publicly congratulate Murdoch on the deal when it was announced, suggesting his approval. 
If AT&T-Time Warner is able to move forward, Verizon immediately becomes another potential buyer of big media. 
Comcast, CNBC's owner, could also consider topping Disney's bid for Fox, according to people familiar with the matter. No decision has been made by Comcast on a topping bid yet, said the people, who asked not to be named because the decision is private. Disney is already preparing itself for a Comcast topping bid and considering responses in case, according to multiple people familiar with Disney's thinking. 
An unsolicited offer at a premium to Disney's bid could persuade enough Fox shareholders to vote against Murdoch. His family controls 39 percent of Fox's Class B voting shares but owns only 17 percent of all outstanding shares. Comcast executives suggested to Murdoch last year they would be willing to pay significantly more for Fox's assets than what Disney was offering, said the people. Murdoch still went with the Disney offer, in large part due to regulatory concerns with Comcast. 
Fox's international businesses are of particular interest to Comcast, which sees more potential growth outside of the U.S. than it does domestically. Spokeswomen for Comcast and Fox declined to comment.
""Many of our peers are re-evaluating their strategies,"" Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said during the company's Jan. 24 earnings call. ""So along the way, there may be opportunities for us to create more value for our shareholders, like we did with NBCUniversal. In this respect, it shouldn't be a surprise that we study every situation that comes along.""
Even if the U.S. district court upholds the Justice Department's decision to block the deal, Time Warner could sue again, bringing the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. That decision could be more than a year away, causing the media landscape to remain frozen for years.
""For the longest time, we had decades of very successful vertical integration, with common finish lines for the whole of the media and telecommunications industries,"" Hindery said. ""Not anymore.""
 Family planning
 Beyond the fear of Silicon Valley's impending takeover of live and original content, companies including Fox, CBS and Viacom are also looking for regulatory clarity so their majority owners can clear up estate planning issues. 
Murdoch's decision to shed Fox assets puts his son Lachlan in place to run the smaller Fox, according to a person familiar with Murdoch's thinking. It also allows his other son, James, the freedom to move away from the business if he chooses, the person said.

 Shari Redstone also isn't waiting for Time Warner, even though CBS and Time Warner could be natural merger candidates.
Sumner Redstone's daughter took control of her 94-year-old father's media empire, National Amusements, last year as his health declined. National Amusements owns about 80 percent of the common stock of CBS and Viacom. Redstone is now considering putting the companies back together after a false start last year.
John Malone has successfully orchestrated two programming mergers in just over a year, putting together Lionsgate and Starz in December 2016 and championing Discovery's decision to acquire Scripps last year. Malone controls about 28 percent of Discovery's voting shares. Lionsgate, now combined with Starz, may look for a larger buyer later this year, although it isn't yet in formal sales talks, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
The sudden push for massive media consolidation is largely driven by the realization that the media ecosystem is shifting from television to the Internet, even if the cable subscription model allows legacy media companies to profitably survive. Still, after decades of pushing for higher affiliate fees from TV operators, such as Comcast, Charter and Dish Network, TV programmers are now banding together to ensure their most popular channels survive and drive growth.
""In the opening scene of 'March of the Penguins,' the penguins are huddling up to get warm in a pack so large so that they can withstand the harshness of winter and survive a little bit longer,"" said Rich Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG who covers the media industry. ""This is what's happening to legacy media companies. They are banding together, trying to stay alive to survive another winter.""
Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com.

 It was a rough day for growth technology investors. So-called FANG stocks lost more than $90 billion in stock value Monday. 
 FANG stocks are a basket of high-growth technology stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) that have led the bull run of the last 9 years.
 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet shares all fell during the dramatic market decline Monday ranging from a drop of 2.8 percent to a 5.1 percent fall.
Alphabet was the biggest loser at $39.5 billion in value lost. The total stock value lost from FANG stocks was $90.7 billion.Even after the sharp drops Monday, all the FANG stocks are up so far this year. Netflix is still up more than 30 percent year-to-date after its strong December quarter results, followed by Amazon's 19 percent year-to-date gain.

 });The 2018 Super Bowl thrilled fans by many accounts, with the Philadelphia Eagles winning the biggest game for the first time, beating the New England Patriots 41-33.
 And as much as the game is huge for sports supporters, it is also massive for advertisers, which this year focused on entertaining people over the chest-thumping political stands they made in 2017. With 30-second TV spots going for more than $5 million, advertisers need to get the most out of their investments.
Analytics company iSpot.tv analyzed how the biggest ads did on game day, based on ""digital share of voice,"" which means the total number of times ads were liked, shared, watched and commented on via the big social platforms. The company also looked at TV ""impressions,"" or the number of times households are ""exposed"" to commercials. It also looked at the advertisers estimated media spend.
 Here is the top 10, ranked by how they did online (digital share of voice).
(Other analyses came up with different Super Bowl ad rankings by looking at different metrics.)
1. Lucasfilm — Solo: A 'Star Wars' Story
""I'm going to be a pilot — the best in the galaxy,"" Han Solo says in this 45-second spot for the next installment of the ""Star Wars"" movie franchise, effectively a trailer for the trailer, out Monday. It was watched more than 3 million times online on game day and had the highest digital share of voice at 8.84 percent. It also achieved 64.6 million TV ad impressions, against an estimated ad spend of $7.8 million.
 2. Marvel — 'Avengers: Infinity War' 
Another Disney-owned movie franchise, Marvel's 30-second ad, featured stars including Benedict Cumberbatch, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans and Tom Holland as they line up to fight Josh Brolin's Thanos. Its share of voice online was 8.55 percent, and TV impressions reached nearly 70 million, on an estimated ad spend of $5.2 million.
 3. PepsiCo — Doritos Blaze vs Moutain Dew Ice: Battle
PepsicCo pitted two of its biggest brands against each other in this 60-second spot featuring ""Game of Thrones"" star Peter Dinklage and Morgan Freeman to a hip-hop soundtrack from Busta Rhymes and Missy Elliott. It was watched online more than 3.5 million times and got a digital share of voice of 8.42 percent. Its TV impressions reached 72.6 million, with an estimated ad spend of $10.2 million.
 4. Amazon Echo — Alexa Loses her Voice
Sir Anthony Hopkins, Cardi B, Gordon Ramsay and Rebel Wilson all ""replace"" Alexa as she loses her voice in this 90-second ad, which also stars Amazon boss Jeff Bezos himself. The ad had a 7.92 share of voice online and hit 81.2 million TV impressions, with an estimated ad spend of $14.9 million.
 5. Universal Pictures — 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom'
Another movie ad, this time for the latest in Steven Spielberg's ""Jurassic World"" series, set to hit movie theaters in the U.S. in June. It's a pretty scary trailer, which got a 6.85 percent share of voice online and 55.9 million TV impressions, with an estimated ad spend of $11.9 million.
 6. Paramount Pictures — 'Mission: Impossible — Fallout'
Film studios continued to push their big summer movies with Tom Cruise variously attempting to board a helicopter midflight, ram his motorcycle into a moving car and leap between buildings in this ad for the sixth in the ""Mission: Impossible"" series. The 30-second spot had a 5.18 percent share of voice online and got 78.8 million TV impressions with an estimated spend of $5.4 million.
 7. NFL — Touchdown Celebrations
Footballers Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. dance to the ""Dirty Dancing"" theme song ""(I've had) the Time of My Life"" and they even do the famous flying lift in this 60-second spot celebrating ""all the touchdowns to come."" It got a 5.05 percent share of voice online and got 69.2 million TV impressions, with an estimated ad spend of $1.4 million.
 8. Pepsi — This is the Pepsi
A walk back through some of Pepsi's most famous commercials, starring Cindy Crawford and son Presley Gerber, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, Jeff Gordon, ""Uncle Drew"" and a DeLorean from ""Back to the Future."" The 30-second had a 4.82 percent digital share of voice and 64.8 million TV ad impressions with an estimated spend of $5.1 million.

 10. Tide — It's a Tide Ad
Commercials for cars, beer, perfume, razors, soda and even voice assistants are sent up in this ad, one of a series for Tide, starring ""Stranger Things"" Police Chief David Harbour.

 FANG stocks can stabilize amid volatility   
 7:45  PM ET Tue,  6 Feb 2018 |  00:59 
 After several days of a rapid-fire sell-off that rattled global markets, CNBC's Jim Cramer and technician Bob Lang took to the charts to prove that some stocks are still worth investors' time.
 Lang, the founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and one of the three market minds behind TheStreet.com's Trifecta Stocks newsletter, specifically called attention to four of the market's most recognizable names.
""Here's the thing: almost exactly five years ago, Lang had this idea for a cute acronym that would sum up the hottest growth stocks around, FANG — short for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, which has since become Alphabet,"" Cramer said. ""I liked the idea so much that I shamelessly adopted it. Some would even go so far as to say I stole it.""
 The ""Mad Money"" host admitted that the FANG stocks, like most, were not immune to the market-wide sell-off. All four stocks fell hard in the last week, only starting to pare their losses on Tuesday.
But in the last five years, their gains have been staggering, Cramer noted: Facebook is up 547 percent, Amazon has run 441 percent, Netflix has surged 967 percent and Alphabet has tacked on 183 percent.
In comparison, the Nasdaq gained 124 percent over the same time frame and the S&P 500 climbed 78 percent — not bad, but weak compared to FANG, Cramer said.
""More importantly, for the last five years, FANG has been incredibly resilient. As Lang points out, the so-called experts tried to crush these stories over and over again,"" Cramer said. ""None of it really mattered. Every time, FANG bounced back.""
So as investors reevaluate their holdings amid wild market volatility, Cramer and Lang took to the charts of each FANG stock to determine whether the tech titans could have even more upside.
 Facebook
 First up was the daily chart of social media giant Facebook. After making a series of higher highs and higher lows, a typically bullish sign, shares of Facebook tanked on Monday, pulling back to $180.
 Facebook's stock even grazed the $177 level on Tuesday before settling at $185, but Lang pointed out that its floor of support just under $180 has held true three times since the fall.
""Will it bounce again? Lang thinks so,"" Cramer said. ""He likes that the Chaikin Money Flow, which measures the level of buying and selling pressure in a stock, has remained positive ... indicating the big institutions still have an appetite for Facebook. Put it all together and he wouldn't be surprised if Facebook can make a move to $200 in the not-too-distant future.""
 Amazon
 Next, Cramer and Lang turned to the daily chart of Amazon, the e-commerce colossus involved in everything from food retail to entertainment to, most recently, health care.
 Amazon shares declined dramatically on Monday, but only after a staggering run, Cramer said. Just over three months ago, Amazon's stock was at $970 a share. Now, it's hovering at $1,442 a share.
The online retailer also reported earnings last Thursday after the market closed, causing the stock to surge by over $100 a share on Friday despite the beginnings of the sell-off.
""Lang likes that the Chaikin Money Flow has stayed strong here, and he also likes that the stock's recent rally happened on strong volume,"" Cramer said. ""There's really a lot to like with Amazon, which is why Lang sees it making a run to $1,500.""
 Netflix
 After spending much of January soaring to new highs, shares of Netflix dropped in recent sessions along with the rest of FANG.
 But Lang noted that Netflix's declines happened on lower volume, an indicator technicians use to determine whether a move is deserved or not. Weak volume means the move could be ""lying,"" Cramer said.
""Meanwhile, Netflix has a nice floor of support at its 20-day moving average, currently at $242, and the Chaikin Money Flow is still very high, meaning the big institutions continue to lap this stock up,"" Cramer said. ""Lang believes Netflix can go from $265, where it is now, to $300.""
 Alphabet
 Finally, Cramer turned to the daily chart of Google parent Alphabet.
 Shares of Alphabet took a nosedive after the company's weaker-than-expected earnings report last Thursday, sinking even more at the start of this week.
""This is the one FANG component that Lang's not feeling quite so sanguine about,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Lang noticed that the stock's moving average convergence divergence indicator, or MACD, which helps technicians spot changes in a stock's path before they happen, recently made a bearish move, depicted on the chart by the black line crossing below the red.
The MACD tends to be a reliable indicator, but Cramer pointed out that Alphabet's money flow was still strong. Still, all things considered, Lang came out fairly bearish on Alphabet.
""Put it all together and Lang could see Alphabet bottoming out at the current levels,"" Cramer said. ""He thinks the $1,050 level would be a buying opportunity, and if the stock can settle down a bit, he wouldn't be surprised if it can head back to $1,200. But he says it's probably going to $1,050 first.""
 Final thoughts
 ""For five years, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet survived everything that the bears had to throw at them, and each time they came out stronger than before,"" Cramer said. ""The charts, as interpreted by the incredible Bob Lang, suggest that this time may be no different. He does expect Alphabet to pull back some more before it can find its footing. But as for Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, he's optimistic. Me? I remain a FANG stalwart.""

Wee Urban owner Holly MacLean
 In January, Holly MacLean got an invite from Amazon to join a stealthy anti-counterfeit program for sellers. The service, called Transparency, aims to bring in 1,000 brands this year to test new technology designed to help clean up Amazon's sprawling and chaotic marketplace.
 Unlike Amazon's own e-commerce business, which the company controls completely, the Amazon Marketplace features millions of independent sellers across the globe listing hundreds of millions of items. Launched in 2000 after several early attempts to create third-party services, it has become an increasingly important part of Amazon's business, and now accounts for over half the company's e-commerce volume. Rapid expansion has forced Amazon to deal with a surge in counterfeits and unauthorized selling.
That said, MacLean felt she was a very odd choice to help Amazon impose more order. Her company has been crushed by impostors on Amazon — and she blames the tech giant for being unable or unwilling to stop it.
 ""They're lighting all these fires,"" said the former schoolteacher and mother of two, ""and then giving us the hose.""
Her baby clothing company, Wee Urban, had been so devastated on Amazon by impostors pretending to be her that she had tried in August to remove her inventory. 
After reaching a peak of $500,000 in Amazon revenue in 2016, Wee Urban's sales on the site plunged 80 percent in 2017. MacLean totally missed the holiday rush, and late last year hired an attorney to help her deal with copyright infringement and other issues.
So she was surprised when, in the middle of January, she received an email and eight-page presentation from a senior business development manager at Amazon, inviting her company to join the ""early adopter phase"" of Transparency, alongside big brands like Bang & Olufsen, Victorinox Swiss Army and 3M, according to confidential documents she forwarded to CNBC.
 Transparency uses new barcode technology designed to verify a product's authenticity. It's free for the first six months for early adopters and then will cost between 1 cent and 5 cents per code, according to the documents she received from Amazon.
""I'm the worst candidate for this,"" said MacLean, who added that she's been blocked from listing items on Amazon. ""I don't have any products on the platform."" 
Meanwhile, sellers with variations of the name Wee Urban have popped up on Amazon sites around the world, and MacLean hasn't been able to figure out who they are. She says she's had more than 100 conversations with Amazon reps to try and resolve the problem.
""We have and will continue to work with this seller to address her concerns,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. ""If sellers think we've made an error that requires further review we encourage them to contact us directly and work with us so we can investigate and take the appropriate action.""
 Amazon
Promotional image for Amazon Transparency program
 In MacLean's view, Amazon is contributing to the chaos on the marketplace through lax enforcement and overly complicated processes for sellers to manage their accounts and police their listings. Then, through programs like Transparency, it's trying to charge them for services to fix these problems.
Even so, Amazon remains the go-to destination for an increasing number of small businesses, who are flourishing on the site and benefiting from Amazon's massive reach, expansive fulfillment centers and logistics systems. The vast majority of these businesses do not experience anything like what MacLean said she went through.
 What MacLean experienced
 MacLean, a 42-year-old former high school teacher, told CNBC that she started Wee Urban in 2010 after a health scare with one of her kids forced her to take time off. Struggling to find high-quality clothing for her boys, she began designing simple sleep sacks from organic materials and sold them on Etsy. She was locally sourcing content and materials and sewing the products herself.
Wee Urban had its own website and developed relationships with retailers across Canada before joining Amazon's marketplace in 2013.
After a blockbuster 2016, MacLean was contacted by Amazon's Canadian sales team, inviting her into a program that would unify her account so that anything loaded onto Amazon.com would sync with Amazon.ca (Canada), making it easier to sell in multiple markets.
She agreed. But her account quickly spun out of control, she says. Wee Urban's sleeping bags started showing up on Amazon.jp (Japan) from third-party sellers that MacLean didn't recognize. Products were appearing in various markets around the world, including China and India, from one or more sellers with some form of the name Wee Urban.
Starting around June, she claims, she would log into her account only to find that her sales in Canada were on hold and she was unable to load in new products. Other people appeared to be making money off her brand, yet customer complaints would come back to her — the real Wee Urban. She could see that mysterious third-party sellers were changing the price of her products that they listed.
Suspecting fraudulent activity, MacLean started pulling some inventory from Amazon's fulfillment centers and discovered that new barcodes had been placed on her items. Packages were affixed with yellow stickers and shorter barcodes than the ones on her official white stickers. 
 Fed up with the process, MacLean tried to close her account in August, with an effective termination date 60 days later in October. 
It didn't work. She was still able to access her account and see that prices on her products were being altered. And she had suddenly been cleared to sell Nike and Apple products (screenshot below), even though she'd never asked for that permission and only ever sold her own brand.
""Someone applied to sell those products in my account,"" she said.
 In December, MacLean says, her actual account was assigned a new seller ID and permitted to sell under the name Weeurban. She owns the trademark for both Weeurban and Wee Urban but was being blocked from using the two-word spelling of the name.
In an email to an Amazon sales manager last month, MacLean wrote, ""There is only one Wee Urban — the Brand and one company, Wee Urban Ltd. How do we get our account to reflect this accurately, to have the other seller's Brand Ownership withdrawn so we can sell our branded products on Amazon.ca and prevent the 'likelihood of confusion' across all marketplaces?""
In response, she was told she had complete control of the ""display name for your selling accounts, and you can change them at any point to be whatever you wish."" In following the instructions provided to edit her store details, the seller information page told her that the display name Wee Urban was unavailable (screenshot below). 
 Late last year, MacLean hired Phil Mann, one of the few intellectual property attorneys to publicly take on Amazon. Mann previously represented pillowcase maker Milo & Gabby, which sued Amazon in 2013 for allowing knockoffs to proliferate on the site. The jury sided with Amazon in 2015, concluding that the marketplace isn't liable for infringement on behalf of third-party sellers.
But the company is responsible for removing counterfeits and other infringing items when a seller shows sufficient proof of violations, and Mann was trying to get Amazon to clear up Wee Urban's listings.
After CNBC informed Amazon about this story, a representative from the company's ""brand incidents team"" reached out to MacLean to discuss her account. She sent the employee a follow-up email with 10 requests, including making the Wee Urban display name and ID consistent across all marketplaces and removing WEEURBAN altogether. The company told her that it's working on her requests, she said.
At this point, MacLean has mostly given up on Amazon and just wants to focus on promoting her products on her website and across 250 retailers in North America. Even though her Amazon business is just about dead, she said her sales elsewhere jumped 60 percent last year to about $500,000.
But she has a whole warehouse full of excess inventory, including 5,000 units waiting to be picked up from a facility in Buffalo. After doubling on Amazon every year through 2016, she expected similar growth last year and had her sleep sacks and dresses manufactured to meet that projected demand.
""It's a hard pill to swallow,"" she said. ""I provide for my family with that income. There are vacations and braces coming down the pike.""
Needless to say, she won't be signing up for the Transparency program.
""I have to focus on building my brand in other ways,"" she said.

 Amazon Prime boss Greg Greeley turns attention to Whole Foods   
 12:59  PM ET Thu,  8 Feb 2018 |  00:50 
 The man who ran Amazon's Prime membership program will now be spending more of his time at Whole Foods.
 Greg Greeley, VP of Amazon Prime and delivery experience, recently told some employees he'll be spending more time at Amazon-owned Whole Foods, focusing on the two companies' integration, CNBC has learned.
Greeley will primarily focus on making Amazon Prime a major part of Whole Foods' customer rewards program.
 Neil Lindsay, VP of worldwide marketing at Amazon, will take on most of Greeley's responsibilities at Prime, according to a source. 
""We are working with the team at Whole Foods Market to deliver tremendous value for Prime members at Whole Foods Market and Greg Greeley will be facilitating that effort (among other things),"" an Amazon representative said in response to a CNBC request for comment about Greeley's move. ""Both the established Amazon Prime and Whole Foods Market teams remain unchanged.""
In related news, Amazon said Thursday that it will offer two-hour grocery delivery from Whole Foods through its Prime Now service in select cities.
Greeley is the first high-profile Amazon executive known to be spending time at Whole Foods, the grocery chain Amazon bought for $13.7 billion last year. His move shows growing integration between the two companies.
During Amazon's earnings call last week, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said Prime is expected to be rolled out in Whole Foods stores possibly by the end of this year.
""We've launched Whole Foods products on our Amazon website, and the technical work continues to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we expect to have more on that later in the year,"" Olsavsky said.
Launched in 2005, Prime is Amazon's paid-membership program that gives access to a number of benefits, including free two-day shipping, unlimited video streaming and online storage space. Amazon hasn't disclosed the number of Prime members, but market research firm CIRP estimates it to be over 90 million in the U.S. alone.
A 19-year veteran at Amazon, Greeley has spent the last four years running Prime. Under his leadership, Prime thrived to become one of the most successful customer loyalty programs anywhere, and added new services like Prime Now, a one-hour delivery option, and Prime Day, Amazon's one-day annual shopping event. He has also held positions in Amazon's international and finance departments.
Since the acquisition, Amazon has dropped prices of certain items at Whole Foods and added some Whole Foods products online. But a recent report by Business Insider said some Whole Foods employees are complaining about a new inventory management system designed to cut down on food waste.
