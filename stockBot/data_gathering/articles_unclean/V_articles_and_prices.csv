 The future remains uncertain for the so-called 'Golden Visa' program   
 9:57  AM ET Fri, 28 April 2017 |  00:56 
 It only took one winter night for a Chinese mother to make the decision to leave her country. In the following two months' time, she rushed to prepare $500,000 in cash, trying to submit all her application documents ahead of April 28 — the expiration date for the current U.S. EB-5 immigrant investor visa program.
 ""My child had been sick for the entire winter and the whole family got respiratory infections due to Beijing's haze weather,"" said Liu, 33, who requested not to share her full name for privacy reasons.
""When I was pregnant, the government promised to treat air pollution. Now, my son is already three years old, but Beijing's haze has only become worse,"" she told CNBC over the phone. ""I need a backup plan.""
 Liu's plan is to obtain U.S. green cards for her family through the EB-5 program, which is often called the ""Golden Visa"" by immigration lawyers because it provides a fast path for rich foreign investors to ""buy"" residency or even citizenship in the U.S.
 The ""Golden Visa""
 Firstly introduced as part of the 1990 Immigration Act, the EB-5 program allows foreigners, who invest between $500,000 and $1 million in qualified projects in the U.S., to apply for permanent resident status for themselves and their families. Generally, the money will be returned to investors within a few years' time.
Initially, the visa program wasn't popular — during the first 18 years, it had always fallen short of the program's annual ceiling of 10,000 quotas. In 2003, for example, the government only issued 65 EB-5 visas to foreign investors.

 The investor EB-5 visa program is set to expire   
 8:36  PM ET Tue,  7 March 2017 |  02:21 
 However, the 2008 financial crisis was a game changer. With liquidity squeezed and few banks willing to lend, developers found the EB-5 program a convenient way to raise cheap capital.
According to the U.S. Commerce Department, between fiscal years 2012 and 2013, more than 11,000 immigrant investors provided a combined $5.8 billion in capital through the EB-5 program and supported 562 projects, which generated about 174,000 jobs in the U.S.
 Growing demand from China
 In recent years, the EB-5 visa program has seen growing interests from Chinese millionaires, with as much as 85 percent of the program's applicants coming from mainland China, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
""Children's education, less pollution and transferring assets overseas are three top reasons why U.S. green cards are so attractive to many Chinese investors,"" said Law, an EB-5 immigration agent based in Los Angeles, who declined to share his full name for professional reasons.
Law's view was echoed by Liu.
""Many of my friends have already submitted applications for EB-5 visas. A few years ago, only the Chinese super-rich were applying; but now, middle-class families are starting to apply as well,"" Liu told CNBC. ""Some even sell their apartments in order to raise enough money.""
 Potential policy changes
 Despite strong demand from Chinese clients, Law predicted limited room for further growth, pointing to potential policy changes under President Donald Trump's administration, stricter capital control by the Chinese government and the backlog of the EB-5 program itself..
Critics have called for the program's termination, arguing that it has been plagued by widespread fraud and political corruption, which might facilitate money laundering, investment fraud or even terrorist travel.
The current program is up for renewal on Friday, and its fate now rests with the new administration and Congress. Although the White House has not provided any official statement on the program, Trump's earlier immigration actions have stirred fear among EB-5 visa applicants.

 ""Many clients urged us to file their applications by the April 28 deadline because they are worried that the government will tighten visa rules, or even terminate the program altogether,"" said Law.
In January, the Department of Homeland Security proposed to increase the minimum investment amount required for the EB-5 program from $500,000 to $1.35 million for projects in rural or high-unemployed areas; from $1 million to $1.8 million for developments in low-to-average unemployment areas.
The increase in capital requirement, if approved, would immediately cool down Chinese investors' demand, according to Law.
""Most applicants just can't afford that much money,"" said Law. ""Among my clients, nine out of 10 are investing in the $500,000 program. They are staying in China and are totally thrown into passivity. EB-5 projects are not risk-free — investing more money means higher risks.""
 Stricter capital control
 And stricter capital control measures by the Chinese government might make money transfer more difficult.
In China, the currency exchange quota for individuals remains $50,000 per person per year, but most Chinese EB-5 visa applicants use two ways to avoid currency restrictions. The first is to transfer through underground banks, and the other is called ""Ants Moving House,"" which means to recruit friends or family members to exchange currency and transfer funds overseas.
""Now, you only need 10 people for an amount of $500,000, but you might need to find another 17 people if the new policy increases capital requirement,"" said Law. ""The Chinese government is going after such transfers and will impose stricter control.""
Law told CNBC that his company plans to slowly withdraw the EB-5 visa services on the concern that tightening immigration policies under the Trump administration will cool down the visa business.
 'The long wait' might be shorter
 In recent years, skyrocketing applications from Chinese investors have created a significant backlog and extended the time frame for their petitions to be approved.
""Today, non-Chinese applicants need to wait about 7 years to get the official green card, but Chinese nationals will probably have to wait 10 years due to the backlog,"" Law told CNBC. ""The long wait has made EB-5 visas less attractive.""
However, he does see a silver lining in the new policy.
""Higher capital requirements will result in fewer new applicants. The backlog will then improve and the long wait for Chinese applicants would become shorter,"" he added.
For Liu, the wait is just starting.
""Waiting a few years might not be a bad thing for us,"" said Liu.
""Nobody knows what's going to happen next, but at least this is like buying a 'life insurance' for the family.""

4,2017-05-09,Kushner family stands to gain from visa rules in Trump’s first major law  ,"Cheriss May | NurPhoto | Getty Images
Jared Kushner
 It was the first major piece of legislation that President Trump  signed into law, and buried  on Page 734 was one sentence that brought a potential benefit to the president's extended family: renewal of a program offering permanent residence in the United States to affluent foreigners investing money in real estate projects here.
Just hours after the appropriations measure was signed on Friday, the company run until January by Mr. Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, was urging wealthy Chinese in Beijing to consider investing $500,000 each in a pair of Jersey City luxury apartment towers the family-owned Kushner Companies plans to build. Mr. Kushner was even cited at a marketing presentation by his sister Nicole Meyer, who was on her way to China even before the bill was signed. The project ""means a lot to me and my entire family,"" she told the prospective investors.
The sequence of events offers one of the most explicit examples to date of the peril of the Trump and Kushner families maintaining close ties to their business interests and creates an impression they stand to profit off Mr. Trump's presence in the White House. It also illustrates the problems of the so-called EB-5 visa program that prominent Republican and Democratic members of Congress want changed.

""It is just one more dilemma that a family with vast commercial interest has when relatives are in the federal government, particularly the White House,"" said Michael H. Cardozo, who served as a deputy White House counsel in the Carter administration, which struggled with its own controversies related to the president's brother,  Billy Carter, and his work on behalf of an American company seeking to get into the oil industry in Libya. ""The actions of relatives can come back and bite those serving those in the government.""
Bipartisan critics in Washington say they want to revamp the visa program because it is often abused. It supports high-end luxury projects, like the Kushner family deal, instead of promoting job creation in rural America or distressed urban areas, as it was intended. It has also been criticized by federal regulators for insufficient safeguards against illicit money coming into the United States; in the case of one applicant, they found potential financial ties to a string of Chinese brothels.
There is no assertion that Mr. Kushner broke any conflict-of-interest rule; but the law does not prevent his relatives from attempting to exploit those ties to benefit the family business.
Mr. Kushner's portfolio includes a central role on China policy. That role has heightened the Kushner family name in a nation accounting for more than 80 percent of the EB-5 visas issued. Wealthy Chinese see the program as an easy way to legally move to the United States.
In fact, Kushner Companies — when Mr. Kushner was still at the helm — had received $50 million in EB-5 financing for a separate New Jersey project, a Trump-branded luxury high-rise tower in Jersey City that opened late last year.
On Monday, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, called the visa program ""a stark  conflict of interest for the Trump White House."" Meanwhile, the ethics watchdog group Democracy 21 called for Mr. Kushner to recuse himself from all policy dealing with China. The group had previously called for Mr. Kushner to make public a full list of his family firm's overseas business partners and lenders as well as a full divestiture of his business assets into a blind trust.
After a surge in attention to the topic over the weekend, a spokesman for Mr. Trump said on Monday that the president also endorses changes to the visa program, including perhaps increasing the price foreigners must pay to get the special immigration status. A White House statement said the administration ""is evaluating wholesale reform of the EB-5 program to ensure that the program is used as intended and that investment is being spread to all areas of the country.""
The statement also said that Mr. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, has recused himself from EB-5 related matters: ""Jared takes the ethics rules very seriously and would never compromise himself or the administration."" In a statement from Kushner Companies, Mr. Kushner's sister said it was not her intent to mention her brother as a way to lure investors.
Other family members of presidents have created stirs in past decades — including  Neil M. Bush, President George Bush's son — as they have engaged in outside business ventures that intersected with the federal government. Hillary Clinton's brother Anthony Rodham  was once cited for inappropriate appeals to government officials about a grant through this very same visa program.
But the matters involving Mr. Kushner, the White House and Kushner Companies are different. None of those previous presidential relatives took jobs in the White House while simultaneously benefiting from a multibillion-dollar business with international partners, who also stand to benefit from federal programs.
Although Mr. Kushner has shed stakes in some of the company's investments, he has retained most of his interest, as the main beneficiary of a series of trusts invested in the firm's various projects. His stake, along with some other investments, is worth as much as $600 million, and possibly much more, according to a government ethics disclosure form made public by Mr. Kushner in March. But Kushner Companies has declined to make public a list of its partners.
The firm has received investments or loans from around the world, including Goldman Sachs, the Blackstone Group, Deutsche Bank and Israel's Bank Hapoalim, the subject of a United States Justice Department tax investigation. Last month, The New York Times  reported that the Kushners had partnered with at least one member of Israel's wealthy Steinmetz family. The family's most well-known member, Beny Steinmetz, is the subject of a Justice Department investigation into alleged bribes.
And in March, Mr. Kushner's firm said it  ended talks with Anbang Insurance Group, a Chinese company with ties to ruling members of the country's Communist Party. Those talks began around the time President Trump secured the Republican nomination and also raised questions because of the potentially favorable terms for Kushner Companies.
When it was created in 1990, the EB-5 visa program was intended to provide a new source of financing for projects in underserved areas, defined as places with high unemployment. But there are no federal standards for defining such neighborhoods. And developers often provide gerrymandered maps to qualify under the program.
The Kushner project in Jersey City ""is a textbook example of the abuses we have seen in the last six or seven years,"" said Shae Armstrong, a Dallas lawyer who has joined with members of Congress, including Senators Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Ms. Feinstein, to call for changes in the program.
That part of Jersey City, less than three miles from Manhattan, is hardly an economically depressed area, and a luxury apartment building is going to create few permanent jobs. ""And it is why other towns in rural America are not getting EB-5 money,"" Mr. Armstrong said.
Indeed, in the Beijing presentation delivered by Mr. Kushner's sister, the firm cited the high household income of the majority of the residents — between $100,000 and $200,000 — in the Trump-branded building that has already received EB-5 financing.
The $1 billion Kushner project at the center of the current controversy is a set of high-rise towers — including 1,730 apartments and 89,000 square feet of retail space. The company is seeking $150 million through the EB-5 program.
Traditional lenders can charge interest of 12 to 18 percent, said Gary Friedland, a professor at New York University who has written extensively about the program. But EB-5 loans can wind up costing developers as little as 4 percent, he said.
""The immigrant investor's primary purpose is to secure a visa, so they accept minimal interest, as low as half a percent,"" Mr. Friedland said.
For developers, said Steve Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell University, the appeal of EB-5 can be summed up in two words: ""Cheap money.""

6,2017-05-19,How to woo Chinese investors: With Visa offers and the Trump name  ,"Getty Images
The site of the One Journal Square luxury apartment project stands in Jersey City on May 9, 2017 in Jersey City, New Jersey.
 For Chinese citizens, American green cards can be notoriously difficult to obtain. But a Beijing immigration company called Qiaowai tells visa applicants of a secret weapon: It is working on behalf of a real estate firm owned by the family of President Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner.
""They said the president would make sure it came through,"" said Lu Ling, a technology executive in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. ""They said there was no chance it could fail.""
As it builds two luxury  apartment buildings in Jersey City, the Kushner family is trying to raise $150 million from Chinese investors through  the so-called EB-5 program, which offers visas in exchange for a $500,000 investment. To get it done, the Kushners have turned to a pair of middlemen who have capitalized on a lucrative government program that critics say has little oversight and loose rules.
 More from New York Times:Roger Ailes: The man who mined a divided America The 10 and a half months that shook Fox News Uber threatens to fire star engineer in legal battle over driverless cars
The companies, Qiaowai and U.S. Immigration Fund, are the go-to matchmakers for big American developers.
They have helped find Chinese investors for many developers' giant projects, including numerous luxury high-rises in Manhattan, a sprawling complex of apartment buildings in Brooklyn and a golf course in Boca Raton, Fla. Last year, they brought Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York City's onetime mayor, to Beijing to speak to potential investors.
Both firms have faced questions about their tactics.
Qiaowai, with more than 400 employees at its headquarters on the 32nd floor of a high-rise, has trumpeted its political connections and played down the program's financial risks. On the Kushner project, Qiaowai promised safe investments and ""guaranteed"" green cards, according to emails and text messages sent to clients and reviewed by The New York Times.
American regulators  warn  against such promises, though foreign firms like Qiaowai are outside the control of the immigration authorities in the United States, who oversee the program. Qiaowai declined to comment.
U.S. Immigration Fund, based in Jupiter, Fla., has been accused by a former top executive of improperly using investor visa funds, and its chief executive has had legal troubles. The firm is a leading lobbying force in Washington, spending $820,000 since early 2015 to block changes to the EB-5 program's rules.
The efforts to raise money in China highlight the potential conflicts between Mr. Kushner's  White House role and Kushner Companies. Although he stepped down as chief executive in January, Mr. Kushner still stands to profit from the company's business, since he is the primary beneficiary of trusts invested in most of its projects.
""No one at Kushner Companies was aware of any statement or guarantee,"" Risa Heller, a company spokeswoman, said in response to questions about Qiaowai. ""They did not and would not authorize that kind of language."" She declined to answer any questions about U.S. Immigration Fund.
Both immigration firms this week removed from their websites descriptions of Kushner projects. ""These are reports for investors and they are still up on the company's password-protected investor portal,"" said Stu Loeser, a spokesman for U.S. Immigration Fund.
The Kushners' tactics for raising money in China is spurring renewed calls for an overhaul of the visa program. The program began in 1990 as a way to revitalize poor neighborhoods, but has turned into a source of cheap financing for luxury developers. It has garnered a reputation  for fraud and abuse. Last month, federal agents  executed search warrants in connection with an investigation into an alleged scheme to defraud EB-5 investors from China.
About 75 percent of the 10,000 visas awarded each year go  to Chinese investors, who are primarily driven by the desire to get a visa, rather than profits. After fees to middlemen, they generally don't make money.
Mr. Kushner's sister, Nicole Meyer, was criticized after mentioning her brother's White House connections when she visited China this month to promote the New Jersey development. Ms. Meyer  later apologized, saying it was not her intention to use her brother's ties to the Trump administration to lure investors.
But the family's Chinese representatives have repeatedly invoked Mr. Trump's name as a selling point.
Qiaowai, which has worked with the Kushners since 2013, describes itself in ads as the company Mr. Trump uses to ""dig for gold."" Its leader, a former banker named Ding Ying, has tried to project an image of proximity to the president, chronicling on the company's website her visit to Washington in January to attend his inauguration. She said she ""exchanged a few words"" with Mr. Trump.
Connecting Qiaowai with the Kushner family is Nicholas A. Mastroianni II, the chief executive of U.S. Immigration Fund. A prodigious fund-raiser, he claims to have collected more than $1.7 billion in EB-5 money since 2010.
He travels frequently to China, reassuring Chinese investors worried about moving abroad, including helping their children adjust and throwing dinners. He also regularly goes to New York City, via private jet, where he has helped finance megaprojects for some of the city's biggest real estate developers.
The Kushner family has turned to Mr. Mastroianni at least twice to finance its ambitions. In 2013, it raised $50 million from 100 investors for a Trump-branded luxury high-rise apartment building in Jersey City, which opened last year. This spring, it announced it would seek the $150 million in EB-5 money for the latest Jersey City project, known as One Journal Square.
In 2014, Fortune magazine found Mr. Mastroianni had faced legal troubles with creditors, partners and the federal Labor Department. In one case, a federal bankruptcy court trustee said he ""knowingly and fraudulently"" failed to hold onto records of his assets.
Several former business partners have filed lawsuits against him, court records show. In a dispute over a stake in the company, David Finkelstein, his former chief financial officer, accused Mr. Mastroianni in a 2015 countersuit of misspending EB-5 funds in a series of projects, including several that involved Qiaowai. He claimed Mr. Mastroianni ""funneled money in and out of various accounts"" in ways that failed to comply with EB-5 requirements.
The litigation was settled, and both sides declined to comment.
In China, Mr. Mastroianni found a ready partner in Ms. Ding of Qiaowai, who built an empire on sending Chinese families abroad.
Qiaowai, founded in 1999, has flourished as the ranks of wealthy Chinese have surged. Such firms often charge more than $50,000 as a finder's fee, commissions that can add up to tens of millions of dollars on large development projects.
Ms. Ding had a motto — ""only genuine and safe investments"" — and a vision of becoming a one-stop destination for wealthy families, helping them find schools, pay taxes and obtain insurance. When speaking at a fund-raising event in early May at the Ritz-Carlton in Beijing, with Mr. Kushner's sister in attendance, Qiaowai representatives said that citizenship and getting money back were ""highly guaranteed.""
Ms. Ding's close relationship with Mr. Mastroianni ensured an advantage in the Chinese market. Mr. Mastroianni routinely brought celebrities, including the golfer Jack Nicklaus, and former American government officials to China, helping burnish the credibility of Qiaowai.
One such guest, Mr. Giuliani, promoted another developer's Times Square project to potential investors at an event in Beijing last year. In a news release at the time, Qiaowai referred to itself and its Florida partner as the ""two most powerful giants in the Sino-U.S. immigration industry.""
Mr. Giuliani factored prominently in Qiaowai's advertising; the company described him to Chinese audiences as America's likely next secretary of state. His law firm, Greenberg Traurig, is the main lobbyist for a trade group fighting changes to the rules of the EB-5 program.
Mr. Giuliani and his firm did not respond to requests for comment.
Prominent former politicians are a staple for U.S. Immigration Fund and other EB-5 promoters. Former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York spoke alongside Mr. Mastroianni at an industry panel in Shanghai, and the former New York State economic development official Charles A. Gargano is the firm's executive director.
Mr. Mastroianni's firm was at the forefront of efforts to stop an overhaul of the EB-5 program in 2015 and 2016, lobbying records show. The firm hired former Representative Ron Klein of Florida, now a lobbyist at Holland & Knight, to make its case on Capitol Hill and court investors in China. Mr. Mastroianni's company also used another lobbyist, former Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York.
""We generally support the reforms relating to oversight, integrity and governance,"" said Mark Giresi, the chief operating officer for U.S. Immigration Fund. ""We oppose efforts to treat urban markets differently than rural markets.""
For Kushner partners, the election of Mr. Trump represented an opportunity.
Mr. Mastroianni's son, Nicholas Mastroianni III, president of U.S. Immigration Fund, donated $100,000 to Mr. Trump's inauguration.
Qiaowai unrolled a series of advertisements featuring Mr. Trump. ""For a company that has cooperated with the Trump family,"" said one ad, ""there is no need to defend itself against rumors about fraud and questions like, 'Is Qiaowai reliable?'""

A private company called Sitel UK is taking charge of the government visa service from Thursday and the government website now states that people ""will need to pay using a credit or debit card for contacting us by email.""
 The fee is applicable to general enquiries and will relate to both those seeking to work in the U.K. as well as holidaymakers who need a visa to visit Britain.

 Want France to be the nation for innovation and startups: President Macron   
 9:36  AM ET Thu, 15 June 2017 |  00:11 
 France launched a technology visa on Thursday which aims to attract international talent, with newly-elected President Emmanuel Macron talking about the need to strip out regulation to become a ""country of unicorns"".
 Speaking at the Viva Tech conference in Paris, France, Macron outlined how his government would slash complex regulation, make it easier for foreign talent to work, and support start-ups with money, in order to create world-leading companies.
The visa is open to start-up founders, employees and investors and is a fast-track procedure to obtain a residence permit in France known as the ""Talent Passport"". It's valid for four years and extended to immediate family members.

French President Emmanuel Macron poses for a selfie as he arrives at the Viva Technology conference dedicated to start-up development in Paris on June 15, 2017.
 ""I want France to attract new entrepreneurs, new researchers, and be the nation for innovation and start-ups,"" Macron told CNBC on the sidelines of the event, prior to the announcement.
""I want this country to become a country of unicorns,"" the French President added later during a keynote speech on Thursday, according to a translation.
Macron said that French talent often leaves the country because the environment is not attractive enough. The key is training and keeping talent in the country.
""The bet of the future for us is to carry on educating our talents, taking our students to the highest levels of academic success. We must defend our educational model, we must help our students go further,"" Macron said, adding that if they end up going to another country, ""they must come back, because here is where the future lies.""
Another proposal put forward by Macron was a European Venture Fund that can support start-ups as they grow. And he spoke about the need for the Digital Single Market – a European Commission policy that aims to harmonize rules from streaming services to roaming charges.
Venture capital investment in France hit $1.6 billion in 2016, a steady level from the $1.7 billion the year before. It still lags the likes of Germany and the U.K. but has seen a lot of investors jump into the market. It also boasts its fair share of unicorns such as long-distance ride sharing company BlaBlaCar.
Macron made a strong rallying cry to the entrepreneurs in France and received a standing ovation from the audience. He spoke in French but aimed to address the international audience by speaking to English to conclude his speech.
""I will ensure that we create a most attractive and creative environment, I will ensue that the state and government acts a platform and not a constraint,"" Macron said.
""Entrepreneur is the new France.""

 Trump and Silicon Valley set to clash over new immigration rule   
 5:20  PM ET Mon, 19 June 2017 |  01:57 
 A new immigration rule that would allow foreign-born entrepreneurs to stay legally in the U.S. and work on their companies could become a key point of contention between tech execs and the White House, who are meeting this week.
 The International Entrepreneur Rule, colloquially called a ""startup visa,"" was created through an executive order from President Obama and was supposed to launch on July 17th, but now the rule has been sent back for review by the Trump administration.
Prateek Joshi, a startup founder in Palo Alto, California, would directly benefit from the new rule if it goes into effect. Originally from India, he's been in the country for about eight years. Currently he is here on an H-1B visa, but it's set to expire soon. If this new entrepreneur rule doesn't pass he may have to move his company and the potential jobs overseas.
 ""The headquarters has to move somewhere else right, because all the jobs that are being created here will be created for example in India, or some other country…Canada, where the government is more supportive of setting up businesses,"" Joshi said.
Currently there is no clear path for foreign-born entrepreneurs to start companies in the U.S. and founders have to navigate obstacles with the existing visa options to gain legal residency. This includes competing with applicants from large outsourcing firms in the H-1B lottery. 
Under the International Entrepreneur Rule, startup founders have to meet strict guidelines: raise at least $250,000 in capital investments from well established U.S. investors and prove they can create U.S. jobs. If they meet those guidelines, entrepreneurs are granted an initial two and half year parole period to stay in country and work on their companies.
Joshi's company, Pluto AI, came about in March 2016 and Joshi said they have raised the required amount of investment to qualify for the rule. He employs three people at the moment and hopes to expand and hire up to 200 employees in the next five years.
While the U.S. limits opportunities for foreign born entrepreneurs and foreign workers, other countries are expanding opportunities. For example, French President Emmanuel Macron on June 15th announced a new technology visa to make it easier for foreign talent to work, and create companies in France.
Todd Schulte, President of pro-immigration group FWD.us, said delaying this rule is the wrong approach because it has bipartisan support and there currently is no visa or rule that specifically helps foreign-born entrepreneurs.
""This is about entrepreneurship in Wisconsin, in Ohio, in North Carolina. It's all over the country, not just Silicon Valley,"" Schulte said.
On May 23, startup founders, investors and civic leaders from places like Kansas, Iowa and Missouri sent a letter to President Trump urging him to implement the International Entrepreneur Rule, arguing that it is important for innovation and job creation all over the country.
Maha Ibrahim, a partner at Canaan Ventures, said 51 percent of the country's unicorns have at least one foreign-born founder.
We need to be able to find a way to foster immigration to this country for innovation,"" Ibrahim said. ""It's scary, certainly hurts our companies in terms of their ability to hire and retain talent, and innovate, that is not just a Silicon Valley problem, it ends up being one that is country wide.""
But others argue that loosening restrictions on work visas hurts American workers. Judiciary Committee chair Charles Grassley was among the critics of the rule when it was first passed, arguing that President Obama should have passed the measure through Congress instead of an executive order.

15,2017-07-14,Visa considers extending ‘war on cash’ business incentives outside US  ,"BSIP | UIG | Getty Images
Woman paying with contactless credit card
 Visa is hoping to extend its ""war on cash"" agenda to businesses in the U.K. after announcing new incentives for U.S. businesses to go cashless.
 The payment technology company revealed on Wednesday that it was launching a ""cashless challenge"" which would see 50 U.S. businesses receive $10,000 each to help them convert to a cashless payment model.
It is now aiming to roll the model out to the U.K., though is yet to set a timeframe for the launch, a Visa spokesperson confirmed to CNBC Friday.
 Under the scheme, businesses in the U.S. are invited to submit plans outlining what going cashless might mean for them, their employees and their customers.
Recipients of the award will then be required to use the lump sum to upgrade their point-of-sale systems so they are completely cashless. Any remaining money can be put towards marketing, the company said.
""We're declaring a war on cash,"" Andy Gerlt, a spokesman for Visa, said in the announcement Wednesday.
""We hope to offer a similar challenge to those merchants who are interested in other countries, including the U.K.,"" a spokesperson told CNBC in a separate email Friday.
""At this time, we do not have a firm plan on when such an initiative would be available in the U.K.""
The proposed $500,000 investment in the U.S. should provide a boon for Visa, the world's largest processor of credit and debit cards: it takes a fee from every payment that runs through the network.
This is one of the reasons many businesses are reluctant to make the transition, or choose to offset the cost to customers by having a minimum spend for card transactions. In the U.K. alone it is estimated that British retailers spent over £1 billion ($1.29 billion) to accept card payments last year, according to research released Wednesday by the British Retail Consortium (BRC).
The EU recently introduced regulation to help businesses, particularly small- to medium-sized ones to cope with this burden. New caps on the fees for handling credit and debit card transactions saved U.K. retailers £500 million last year, according to the BRC.
However, it argues more can be done by card companies to reduce transaction fees, beyond helping with the initial start-up costs.
""It is ultimately the customer that decides how they wish to pay and BRC research shows that customers continue to use cash for more than 40 per cent of transactions in the UK,"" a spokesperson for the BRC told CNBC via email.
""At the same time, cash accounts for only 11 per cent of retailers' costs associated with accepting payments, compared to 73 per cent for card payments, therefore card companies can better serve retailers and their customers by providing a more cost-efficient service.""
It is estimated that, as of this year, more than half of all customer transactions in the U.K. were made via card payments, spurred in part by the growing popularity of new technologies including contactless payment and Apple Pay.
But the Bank of England's chief cashier, Victoria Cleland, has warned against businesses isolating those customers who continue to prefer notes and coins. In a speech delivered last month on the future of cash, Cleland pointed to the 2.7 million people in the U.K. – almost 5 percent – who rely almost solely on cash for their day-to-day payments and insisted that businesses ensure ""financial inclusion.""
""While reliance on cash is less significant than in the past, it is still crucial to everyday life and I encourage the cash industry to continue to innovate, to evolve, and to keep cash relevant and fit for purpose,"" Cleland said in a speech on the future of cash.

 Visa beats on top and bottom line   
 8:23  PM ET Thu, 20 July 2017 |  00:49 
 Visa reported earnings that beat analysts' expectations Thursday after the bell.
 Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:
 EPS: 86 cents vs. 81 cents, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $4.57 billion vs. $4.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters 
 Last year, Visa reported earnings per share of 17 cents on $3.63 billion in revenue. This year's revenue figure represents a 26 percent year-over-year increase. 
The company attributed the increase to the inclusion of Europe, growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions.
Payments volume growth increased to 38 percent to $1.9 trillion from the year-earlier quarter. CEO Alfred Kelly said on a conference call following the earnings release that volume was ""solid"" across all five regions covered, but growth was ""particularly strong"" in India, the U.S., Russia, Mexico and Australia. 
""As you know, our largest presence by quite a large measures in the U.K. has held up well,"" Kelly said, citing benefits from the lower value of the pound driving lots of traffic into the country. 
Visa's stock was up more than 1 percent after hours following the announcement.
Visa reaffirmed its outlook for the rest of the year. Starting next quarter, reported growth rates will include Visa Europe and Costco in prior-year numbers, CFO Vasant Prabhu said on a call with investors.
On Tuesday, Visa announced it would expand its PayPal partnership to Europe. The two companies already collaborate in the U.S. and Asia Pacific.
The PayPal announcement represents Visa's latest push into Europe. Visa decided last month to invest in Klarna, a Swedish online payment company. Last quarter, Visa said the closing of its acquisition of Visa Europe continued to drive strong revenue growth. 
Visa shares hit an intraday all-time high on Wednesday, trading at levels not seen since its initial public offering in March of 2008. The company's stock has gained more than 25 percent this year, outperforming the Dow Jones industrial average's 9 percent gains.

18,2017-08-04,Kushner Companies Said to Be Under Investigation Over Visa Program  ,"Nicholas Kamm | AFP | Getty Images
Jared Kushner, son-in-law and senior adviser of President Donald Trump.
 Federal prosecutors are investigating Kushner Companies, the real estate firm owned by the family of Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, over its use of a program that grants visas to wealthy overseas investors.
The authorities, in part, are looking into the role of Mr. Kushner's sister, Nicole Meyer, according to a person familiar with the matter who confirmed the inquiry.
The investigation centers on the real estate company's use of the so-called EB-5 program, which offers visas to foreigners in exchange for a $500,000 investment. Critics say the program has weak oversight and lax rules.

At a marketing event in May, Ms. Meyer promoted the company's connections to the Trump administration as she courted Chinese investors for a pair of luxury apartment towers being built by the Kushner Companies in New Jersey. The project ""means a lot to me and my entire family,"" she told prospective investors at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Beijing.
Mr. Kushner gave up his role running the family company in January. He still owns a significant piece of the business.
In a statement, Kushner Companies' general counsel, Emily Wolf, said the company was cooperating with the authorities.
""EB-5 is a longstanding federal program that is frequently used by many large developers to raise funds and help create jobs,"" Ms. Wolf said. ""Kushner Companies utilized the program, fully complied with its rules and regulations and did nothing improper.""
She added: ""Neither Kushner Companies nor Nicole Meyer have done anything wrong in connection with the EB-5 program, and any suggestion to the contrary is simply false. The company and Ms. Meyer are cooperating with all legal requests in order to show that they did everything properly and clear up any questions.""
The investigation was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal, which said Kushner Companies had received a subpoena. The focus of the investigation is unclear.
The Kushners are seeking $150 million in EB-5 money for a pair of high-rise apartment buildings in Jersey City, known as One Journal Square. In May, Ms. Meyer marketed the development at events in Beijing and in Shanghai.
At the Beijing event, Ms. Meyer mentioned her brother's former role at the family company, saying he left to serve in the Trump administration. The two events were hosted by Qiaowai, a Beijing immigration company that promised good returns and ""guaranteed"" green cards to investors in the Jersey City project.
Mr. Kushner has played an important role in United States-China relations, brokering meetings between Mr. Trump and top Chinese officials. About three-quarters of the roughly 10,000 investor visas issued last year went to applicants from China.
Ms. Meyer apologized for mentioning her brother and did not appear at later events on the trip.
This is not the first time Kushner Companies has turned to the program. In 2013, it raised $50 million in EB-5 financing for a Trump-branded luxury high-rise apartment building in Jersey City, which opened late last year.
Created in 1990, the program was intended to provide financing for projects in areas with high unemployment. It has turned into a popular source of cheap financing for luxury developments.
There are no federal standards to define the areas that qualify for the program. And developers have been accused of providing gerrymandered maps to qualify.
The Government Accountability Office, the watchdog arm of Congress, has criticized the EB-5 program, citing lax safeguards against illicit sources of funds.
Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, have divested a portion of his stake in the family real estate empire, including the Jersey City project. But he has retained ownership in the bulk of the business, including the building that had received EB-5 funds.
Government ethics filings show the stake held by Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump in the family business and other investments is worth as much as $761 million to them.
Blake Roberts, a lawyer who is advising the couple on ethics issues, has said that Mr. Kushner will recuse himself from matters concerning the EB-5 program.
Qiaowai, the Chinese immigration company helping Kushner Companies find investors, did not respond to a request for comment.

 Credit card companies benefit from paper-to-plastic shift   
 7:06  PM ET Tue,  8 Aug 2017 |  00:48 
 Jim Cramer loves when strong, secular themes drive stocks. One of his favorites has been the shift from paper to plastic as credit cards increasingly dominate payments worldwide.
 ""As we move closer to a cashless society, I want to go off the charts with the help of Bob Lang. He's the founder of ExplosiveOptions.net as well as being the brilliant technician in the three-man, all-star team behind TheStreet.com's Trifecta Stocks newsletter,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""I want to get a better sense of what's happening with the four major credit card companies. Of course, we're talking about Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover.""
Cramer began with the daily chart of Visa, the largest credit card issuer of the four. Up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017, Visa is one of the Dow Jones Industrial average's top components, partially responsible for the average's recent 22,000 landmark, Cramer said.
 Having hit an all-time high on Tuesday, Visa's stock has been notoriously tough to buy into at lower levels, Lang said. 
""He notes that every time Visa's pulled back to its short-term 50-day moving average, that's the blue line, it's been an extraordinary buying opportunity,"" Cramer said.
Visa's rally can also be verified by the strong volume behind the move, Lang said. Big runs that happen on high volume rather than weak volume tend to be much more sustainable, he added.
""Put it all together and Lang thinks Visa's the best name in the group,"" Cramer said. ""He wouldn't be surprised if the stock can climb up to $120 by the end of the year. That's up nearly 20 percent from these levels.""
Mastercard has also been rallying healthily, Cramer said, turning to the second-largest credit card company's daily chart.
Lang pointed out that the moving average convergence divergence indicator, a tool that predicts upcoming changes in a stock's trajectory, is still in overbought territory, meaning Mastercard's shares may have run too far too quickly.
""Ideally, Lang would like to see Mastercard pull back to its 50-day moving average. That's been an excellent floor of support for the stock,"" Cramer said. ""However, given that Mastercard's doing quite well and the company has a large, aggressive buyback, you might have to wait a long time for that kind of decline.""
After years of disappointing investors and struggling to lift its stock, American Express has been on a tear since the company turned itself around in 2016, Cramer said.
 Lang noticed what looked like a cup-and-handle pattern, when a stock gets sold off and then quickly bounces back before trading sideways for a while, forming in the card issuer's chart.
""This is one of the most reliably bullish chart formations around,"" Cramer said. ""Now that American Express has broken out above $85, Lang is betting it could reach $100 very soon.""
Finally, Cramer turned to the runt of the group, Discover Financial Services. Shares of Discover are down 14 percent year to date, and Lang does not expect the outlook to improve.
""After the stock's big breakdown in March, it's made a series of lower lows and low highs. That is not a good sign,"" Cramer said.
Since the beginning of the year, Discover has run into two possible ceilings of resistance at $64 and $66, and with so much going right in its rivals' stocks, it seems to hint at negative prospects.
""Here's the bottom line: The charts, as interpreted by Bob Lang, suggest that Visa, MasterCard and American Express will continue to be the big winners from one of my favorite themes, the gradual switch from paper to plastic,"" Cramer said. ""But this is not a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats situation, because Discover's stock has been left behind and Lang doesn't see that changing any time soon.""

 Blockchain has tremendous momentum: Top payments analyst   
 4:44  PM ET Thu, 12 Oct 2017 |  02:19 
 The No. 1-ranked payments analyst thinks Visa and MasterCard will hold their own amid the ""real"" rise of bitcoin. 
 ""The reality is consumer payments, which is where Visa and MasterCard play, is extraordinarily efficient today,"" Lisa Ellis, senior analyst at Bernstein, said Thursday on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" Ellis is ranked top payments analyst by Institutional Investor, and the two credit card stocks are her top long-term stock picks. 
Consumer payments ""are the one spot where there's not a problem waiting to be fixed,"" she said.

 On the other hand, institutionally focused financial markets are still quite inefficient. That's where developers are trying to apply blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin and other digital currencies, to help speed up transactions and cut costs. 
""The vision for these systems, the digital currency systems, bitcoin and ethereum, is to create a global set of payment rails, the same way the internet is a global set of information rails,"" Elllis said. ""That's what they're trying to do, and there's a lot of momentum and a lot of validity to that vision.
""Blockchain is getting a tremendous amount of momentum independent of bitcoin in core banking,"" Ellis said.
As for the digital currency that leaped to record highs Thursday, she said, ""I think it's real. I do.""

U.S. President Trump speaks on the phone in the Oval Office.
 A federal judge ruled on Friday that the Trump administration can't delay an Obama-era immigration rule that would let foreign start-up founders into the U.S. without a visa.
 The exemption for immigrants who create companies and employ Americans was set to go into effect this past July. But the government said at the last minute it would delay its implementation until March 2018.
The National Association of Venture Capitalists and others sued to overturn the delay. On Friday, the U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., ruled in their favor.
 The International Entrepreneur Rule allows immigrant entrepreneurs and their families to remain in the U.S. for 30 months without a green card or other visa and apply for another 30-month extension after that.
The rule, created during the waning days of President Obama's administration, is designed to encourage more foreign entrepreneurs to start companies in the U.S.

 Trump: DACA legislation must include wall, end visa lottery   
 12:51  PM ET Thu,  4 Jan 2018 |  01:39 
 President Donald Trump signaled his willingness on Thursday to provide protections for ""Dreamers"" but only if a deal includes a border wall with Mexico and tightens immigration restrictions.  
 Trump made his comments to reporters during a meeting with Republican senators to discuss immigration policy, including a March deadline to restore protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
""Any legislation on DACA must secure the border with a wall, it must give our immigration officers the resources they need to stop illegal immigration, and also to stop these overstays,"" Trump said. 
 ""Crucially, this legislation must stop chain migration, and it must end the visa lottery,"" he added, ""and I think many of the Democrats agree with us on that."" 
Trump then described, incorrectly, how the green card lottery system works. He implied that other countries get to decide who can enter the lottery, which is in fact administered by the U.S. State Department. He also suggested that lottery applicants are not carefully screened, which is also inaccurate.
""We need to ensure that our immigration officers have the tools and resources they need,"" Trump said, adding that border patrol agents had supported Trump's presidential campaign. 
It remains far from certain that congressional Democrats will agree to the terms that Trump outlined for a DACA deal. Early negotiations indicate that Democrats would be open to increases in border security funding but not to fundamentally changing the visa lottery program or the family migration system. 
Trump announced in September that he would cancel Obama-era DACA protections for some 800,000 young people who were brought to the United States by their parents, when they were children. At the time, the president gave Congress six months to pass legislation enshrining DACA protections into law.

 Some cryptocurrency-backed cards dropped from Visa network   
 6:42  PM ET Mon,  8 Jan 2018 |  01:00 
 Visa ended its relationship with a large cryptocurrency card provider on Friday, causing thousands of people's transactions to be declined and scrambling to figure out how to access their money. 
 The card provider, WaveCrest, confirmed in an email to CNBC that it was required ""to immediately close all Visa cards."" 
""As a licensed E-Money Institution, WaveCrest is required to safeguard funds to cover all of its issued electronic money and we can confirm that these funds are safe and available for redemption through other channels,"" the statement read. 
 Visa said in a statement that ""it recently terminated a single prepaid card issuer in Europe from our network for violating Visa's operating regulations. That issuer, WaveCrest, was required to close its Visa card products, some of which were linked to cryptocurrency wallets.""
Wavecrest provided its services to a number of crypto-card companies, including Bitwala, Cryptopay, Wirex and TenX. These companies convert people's cryptocurrencies into cash that is loaded on to a prepaid card, allowing people to use the currency for everyday transactions. 
Now these cards are invalid. 
Dmitry Lazarichev, co-founder of cryptocurrency card company Wirex, said he's received thousands of calls from frantic customers. He said his company has issued some 500,000 cryptocurrency debit cards to people across the world, although not in the United States. 
""All the cards were shut down in one second,"" Lazarichev said, adding that WaveCrest hasn't been responsive. ""We asked for more information, but they haven't provided any.""
TenX, another cryptocurrency card company affected, tried to reassure users.

 Alexander T., the man in the above tweet, who declined to give his last name, said he uses his cryptocurrency card to book hotels and pay for groceries. Thursday, he had been traveling from Spain to Switzerland, when he stopped in at a bar. His card was declined. 
He's afraid he'll lose the money on his card.
""The problem is, I went on vacation,"" he said. ""I put a lot of money on this card.""
He also worries that this mainstream way of using bitcoin will vanish. 
""For all people who use bitcoin for their day-to-day expenses, it was the only way to do that,"" he said. 
""Our actions were not specific to cryptocurrency,"" Visa said in the statement, ""but rather reflect the issuer's failure to comply with Visa's policies that ensure the safety and integrity of our payment system.""

 Visa CEO Alfred Kelly weighs in on tax cuts, bitcoin and global transactions   
 1:01  PM ET Wed, 17 Jan 2018 |  06:44 
 Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, is not really money and Visa won't touch it, the credit card giant's CEO told CNBC.
 ""I don't view it as payment system player,"" Alfred Kelly said in an interview recorded on Tuesday at the National Retail Federation conference in New York City.
Despite the emergence of bitcoin as digital money that can be used in a limited fashion to buy things, Kelly said, ""We at Visa won't process transactions that are cryptocurrency-based. We will only process fiat currency-based transactions.""
 Fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, are issued by governments as legal money. But, as Investopedia describes it, they are not backed by any physical commodity.
Bitcoin, as CoinDesk explains, is not issued by anyone. It's ""mined"" or ""discovered"" by powerful computers around the world competing with each other to solve certain algorithms. The miners then write those transactions to the online blockchain ledger, where all activity is recorded and shared with everyone.
In the current environment, bitcoin acceptance as payment is rather limited, but as prices have soared, it's become widely traded as a store of value like gold.
""My take is that bitcoin is much more today a commodity that somebody could invest in; and honestly, somewhat of a speculative commodity,"" said Kelly, who became the chief executive of Visa in December 2016.
 Speculative indeed, considering bitcoin prices lost about a quarter of their value in the past two days and were cut in about half since last month's record high above $19,000. But even with the recent plunge, bitcoin is still up more than 1,000 percent in the past 12 months.
Earlier Wednesday, on Bank of America's post-earnings conference call with analysts, Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan responded to a question about cryptocurrencies after the financial giant banned its advisors from buying bitcoin-related investments for their clients. ""We basically told people they could buy at other accounts, not at Merrill Lynch,"" Moynihan said.
