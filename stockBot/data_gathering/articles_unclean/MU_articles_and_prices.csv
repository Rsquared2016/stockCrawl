 Charting the semiconductors' turnaround   
 7:30  PM ET Wed, 19 April 2017 |  02:27 
 As semiconductor stocks rally off supplier Lam Research's strongearnings report, Jim Cramer took to the charts of three major chipmakers for a closer look at the sector's big winners.
 The ""Mad Money"" host turned to Strategic Portfolio Solutions' Suz Smith for her take on the daily charts of Microchip Technology, Micron, and Advanced Micro Devices, three high-performing semiconductor plays.
Smith's favorite name in the space is Microchip, which makes microcontrollers for various devices.
 ""In the case of Microchip, Smith says we're dealing with a stock that has very strong institutional ownership. In other words, Microchip is almost an anointed winner at this point given this trajectory, even if we haven't talked about it that much on the show,"" Cramer said.
 According to Smith, Microchip's daily chart showed the stock, which trades around $74, making bullish moves that indicate it could go higher in the near term.
One such move was illustrated by a technical indicator called the full stochastic oscillator, which shows when a stock is overbought or oversold. As it moves higher, it sends a buy signal, Cramer said.
Another was in the moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, indicator, which tracks a stock's trajectory before it happens. The black line on the chart crossing above the red line means a positive push upward could be in store for Microchip's stock.
""If Microchip Technology can clear its near-term ceiling at $75, which is only a few cents above where the stock is currently trading, ... then Smith believes it can make its way to $86 in the not-too-distant future,"" Cramer said, adding that its upcoming earnings report could be the catalyst.
The daily chart of Micron, which manufactures DRAMs, flash memory chips, and other commodity products, also showed the stock gearing up for a serious rally.
""Eventually, Micron's end markets will go bust as they get flooded with new supply and pricing comes down, ... but for the moment, it's still very much in boom mode and that could last quite a while before this move runs out of juice,"" Cramer said.
Not only did the stochastic oscillator show Micron coming out of being grossly oversold — a classic buy signal — but the Williams percent R oscillator, another tool measuring overbought and oversold conditions, indicated a possible move higher out of oversold territory.
""Perhaps best of all, Smith notes that Micron has a floor of support at $25.84, about a buck and a half below where it's currently trading, which makes this a low-risk entry point, as she believes Micron could have smooth sailing ... to the $34 level,"" Cramer said.
Finally, the chart of Advanced Micro Devices, the best performing semiconductor stock of 2016, showed the stock settling above its March lows and the selling volume decreasing. Like in the others, indicators showed the stock turning up out of oversold territory as well.
""My one concern is that AMD reports on May 1st, and while this company has given us a miraculous turnaround — I mean, just incredible — a less-than-perfect quarter might throw this whole story out of kilter,"" Cramer said.
Cramer's bottom line is that Lam Research did wonders to lift the semiconductors with its earnings report and signaled that their products are in high demand.
""And the charts, as interpreted by Suz Smith, suggest that Microchip Technology, Micron, and AMD are all worth buying,"" the ""Mad Money"" host concluded.

A booth of Micron Technology at an industrial fair in Frankfurt, Germany, July 14, 2015.
 Shares of Micron Technology fell on Friday, dragging the broader chips sector lower.
 The iShares PHLX Semiconductor exchange-traded fund (SOXX) slipped 0.2 percent, with Micron falling about 4 percent to lead the decliners. Shares of chip makers Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia — last year's best-performing S&P 500 component — also traded lower.
Semiconductors have been underperforming lately. In the past month, the SOXX ETF has fallen about 5 percent, helping to drag down the overall tech sector lower.
 Tech stocks have been the best performers this year, rising more than 16 percent. But the space has been under pressure lately given its high valuation.
Micron had traded higher in the premarket Friday on the back of better-than-expected quarterly results on Thursday.
Kevin Cassidy, semiconductor equities analyst at Stifel, told CNBC in an email that Micron's stock decline is a combination of selling on the news and concern that the Chinese may disrupt the semiconductor market.
He added that Friday is the last trading day of the quarter, and Micron has been a big gainer this year, which could be adding to the stock's volatility. Micron has risen more than 37 percent this year.

 Wild moves in semiconductor stocks are telling the truth   
 7:23  PM ET Tue, 15 Aug 2017 |  00:59 
 The semiconductor stocks have been trading wildly of late, getting hit in July 2017 and again during last week's sell-off before bouncing back on Monday.
 These dramatic moves made Jim Cramer wonder which move was really telling the truth about where the group is headed: down with the pullback or up with the rally?
That's why the ""Mad Money"" host teamed up with technician Carolyn Boroden, the brain behind FibonacciQueen.com and one of his colleagues at RealMoney.com, to go off the charts of three key chipmakers' stocks: Nvidia, Micron and Applied Materials.
 Cramer started with Nvidia's daily chart. One of the top stocks in the S&P 500 Index for the second year in a row, his dog's namesake gave buyers a momentary chance to get into the stock last week before running back up to $166 and change as of Tuesday.
 While investors who don't already own shares of Nvidia might be late to the party, Boroden believes the stock still deserves their attention.
""The stock occasionally gives you a pullback like last week ... and when that happens, it tends to really roll over as weak-handed bulls, who owned it only because it was going higher, decide to abandon ship,"" Cramer said.
Boroden noted that Nvidia's decline last week was similar to its past declines over the course of its rally. She also found two strong floors of support, from $151 to $152 and from $144 to $148.
After Nvidia grazed the first floor of support last week, dipping below $153, the stock bounced back hard, and Boroden believes it can continue to do the same going forward.
""Given that August and September are brutal months where we often get short, sharp pullbacks ... you'll want to watch this $152 level in case Nvidia gives you another buying opportunity,"" Cramer suggested.
Based on Nvidia's stock pattern to date, Boroden thinks the next pullback could come in mid-September. That said, she still gives the stock three upside targets: from $176 to $180, then from $187 to $188, and if the stock pushes past both, then she expects it to hit a ceiling at $209.
""So, if you already own it, like my charitable trust does, Boroden thinks you could have smooth sailing until next month, and if you don't own it, then maybe think about waiting for that next sell-off in September, if it holds these levels, to pull the trigger,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Micron's stock is more boom-and-bust than Nvidia's. Shares of the commodity chipmaker peaked in June and have drifted lower since before bouncing back on Monday.
With the stock up over $29 as of Tuesday's closing bell, Boroden wouldn't be shocked to see it climb to $34 or even $36. But if Micron breaks below its $25 floor of support, Boroden said that would start the ""bust"" part of its cycle.
""Once Micron and its competitors start really boosting their production, pricing will eventually fall apart. The earnings estimates will get slashed,"" Cramer said. ""Of course, that's been hanging over Micron's head for ages. [It] hasn't stopped the stock from rallying hard over the past 18 months, but it has most recently. Just remember that the run in Micron has a limited shelf-life.""
Applied Materials' situation is similar, Boroden said: If the stock can hold above its floor of support in the low $40s, it could rally to the high $40s or even the low $50s.
But just like the others, if Applied Materials dips below $41 or its second floor of support just above $40, then Boroden suggests investors ditch the semiconductor equipment stock.
""The charts ... show you how to approach the likes of Nvidia, Micron and Applied Materials when they get hit,"" Cramer said. ""And given that we're in a historically rough time of year, I bet they'll get hit again in the not-too-distant future. When that happens, I'm very on board with Nvidia. I like Applied Materials. Micron? At this point, it is too boom and bust for me, and I do believe the easy money has been made and then some.""

 Investors should buy Micron Technology shares because new technology markets will generate more demand for its memory products, according to JPMorgan, which reiterated its overweight rating on the chipmaker. ""We believe investors are underestimating the positive impact of new and broad-based demand drivers beyond PCs and smartphones in areas such as AI/Deep Learning and continued strength in data center/networking,"" analyst Harlan Sur wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. ""We expect supply of memory components to remain tight at least for the next few quarters and, though we anticipate ASPs [average selling prices] returning to its normal trend of typical sequential declines in 2018, we anticipate Micron driving margins higher in FY18 on continued cost reductions in NAND [flash memory] and DRAM [memory].""

 A slew of chip stocks is likely headed for gains after Apple's product launch Tuesday, JPMorgan predicts.
 With many investors expecting significant developments in the next generation of iPhone, JPMorgan listed some of the companies likely to see shares jump, including Apple's rising chip technology partner, Broadcom.
""As we have discussed in prior research, we expect Broadcom to benefit from increased dollar content in the forthcoming iPhone models, including the new OLED version that we expect to use Broadcom's touch control technology,"" wrote JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur.
 ""In total, Broadcom has pointed to a 40% increase in blended content in the new iPhone models, and we believe the company's non-RF content [wireless charging, touch controller, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, GPS] is increasing by $3-$4 per iPhone versus last year's models.""
The relationship between Apple and Broadcom has been hot lately, generating much attention from Wall Street analysts in the run-up to what is expected to be a major upgrade for the iPhone. Sur previously noted that the wireless charging partnership between Apple and Broadcom — ""a key enabler of Apple's best-in-class performance""— has been going on for about two years.
Apple's new product presentation is set to start around 1 p.m. ET.
""We believe Broadcom is a leader in wireless communications, enterprise storage, networking, and broadband with broad-based exposure to positive trends,"" wrote Sur, reiterating his overweight rating.
While Broadcom may make headlines, JPMorgan also highlighted antenna and radio frequency provider Qorvo. The company's mobile segment supplies radio solutions that provide a wide variety of functions in the cellular radio space for major phone manufacturers and could stand to reap big gains if Apple's product launch is a success.
Qorvo is already up a whopping 38 percent since January. Seth Klarman, the value investing giant who draws comparisons to Warren Buffett, purchased a large stake earlier this year. Klarman's hedge fund, Baupost, acquired 7.2 million shares of Qorvo worth $493 million, according to the March quarter 13F filing.
Strong iPhone demand would benefit memory players like Micron Technology as well, which supplies phones with types of random access memory (RAM).
""Micron and other industry participants should benefit from increased DRAM demand (unit demand and potential increases in content per phone) from Apple in 2H17 and into 2018,"" Sur said. ""We anticipate Micron benefitting from the new iPhone launches and remind investors that the iPhone 7+ contained 3GB of DRAM vs. 2G of DRAM for the iPhone 7 and prior iPhone versions.""

Micron Technology Double-Data-Rate Synchronous Random-Access Memory (SDRAM) chip
 Wall Street rarely likes to talk about mistakes, but Goldman Sachs admitted it underestimated the strength of the memory chip market when it downgraded Micron shares in May.
 The firm reversed course and raised its rating for chipmaker's shares on Tuesday to buy from neutral, predicting the company will generate earnings above Street expectations in fiscal 2018.
Micron's stock is up 56.4 percent year to date through Tuesday compared with the S&P 500's 11.5 percent gain.
 ""While we believe it could be the mid- to later stages of the memory upturn and note memory fundamentals can change quickly, our industry discussions suggest 4QCY17 DRAM [dynamic random-access memory] pricing could rise (with NAND [flash memory] flat to up) and the DRAM cycle could remain tight in 2018,"" analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note to clients.
Delaney raised his price target for Micron shares to $40 from $33, representing 17 percent upside from Tuesday's close.
Previously, he reduced his rating for stock to neutral from buy on May 7. The chipmaker's stock was up 22 percent after that downgrade through Tuesday.
""DRAM companies have been more disciplined with capex than we expected,"" he wrote. ""Pricing is also higher than we expected.""
The analyst cited how the price of a 32 gigabyte PC server memory module now costs $285 versus $240 in the second-quarter and $120 in the summer of 2016.
""Further, we believe mobile DRAM pricing could be up 10% in 2H17 as DRAM companies shifted capacity into servers (mobile DRAM pricing has been relatively stable this cycle so far),"" he wrote.
As a result, Delaney raised his Micron fiscal 2018 earnings per share estimate to $7.60 from $5.15 versus the Street consensus of $6.24.

 Micron Technology beats the Street   
 8:17  PM ET Tue, 26 Sept 2017 |  00:55 
 Micron Technology reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations on Tuesday.
 Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:
 EPS: $2.02 vs. $1.83 expected, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $6.14 billion vs. $5.96 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters 
 In the year-ago quarter, Micron reported an adjusted loss per share of 1 cent on $3.22 billion in revenue.
Micron shares gained as much as 4 percent in after-hours trade.
CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said Micron expects ""healthy industry fundamentals to continue into 2018.""
For the fiscal first quarter, Micron said it expects earnings between $2.09 and $2.23 a share on revenue between $6.10 billion and $6.50 billion.
Those ranges were well above Street expectations. Analysts had projected first-quarter earnings of about $1.85 per share on $6.06 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.
Wall Street has said Micron could benefit from growing demand for memory products as new technology markets open up. Areas like artificial intelligence and networking may drive a growing share of demand for products from chipmakers like Micron.
Analysts have been optimistic about the stock. The average price target on Micron shares was near $44.88 before Tuesday's close, implying a roughly 29 percent upside.
Shares of Micron have rocketed nearly 60 percent so far this year, outperforming the 23 percent gain in the broader S&P 500 Information Technology sector.
The stock hit a 52-week intraday high of $36.60 last week. The stock closed at $34.18 on Tuesday.

 Tech leading the way   
 6:50  PM ET Thu, 12 Oct 2017 |  00:58 
 It's easy to forget that stocks can trade, and trade viciously, on the trends of supply and demand, CNBC's Jim Cramer said on Thursday.
 ""Like any other market, when there's too much demand, stocks go higher, and when there's too much supply ... stocks go lower,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Today, you could see those supply and demand dynamics in action ... and that led to some very difficult trading.""
When it comes to demand, the technology sector is a clear leader, Cramer said. Investors are hungry for everything from semiconductor and gaming stocks to those tied to e-commerce, social media and software.
 Cramer added that the transportation stocks, including airlines, freight forwarders and rails, are also in demand.
Supply is still rife in the struggling retail sector, in which companies are slashing prices to avoid being crushed by high-volume online retailers like Amazon.
Oil stocks are also lagging on a surplus of inventory as energy companies continue to sell oil futures at $50 despite the International Energy Agency's bearish outlook for the fate of oil.
Bank stocks are also creating a ""glut of supply"" in the market due to a tepid response to earnings from Citigroup and JPMorgan, Cramer said. While the reports beat analyst estimates, both stocks endured losses on concerns over credit costs and lower trading revenues.
Micron was Cramer's top example for tech stocks that drove Thursday's demand. A $1.2 billion stock offering from the semiconductor giant brought so many buyers that shares priced at $41 instead of $40, even floating above $41 for most of Thursday before being dragged down.
""It's incredible that it hung in above $41 for so long despite a declining session. Yes, there's that much demand for semiconductor stocks that when a big chunk comes up for sale, the big institutions couldn't get enough of it,"" Cramer said. ""Plus, Micron's spending the money wisely. They're using $476 million to pay down debt, then using the rest to buy new equipment so they can build more DRAMs and flash chips.""
Cramer said this was important because if all of Micron's money went to decreasing its debt, investors would worry about lower demand. If it all went to new equipment, they would worry about oversupply.
""Instead, we got this happy medium and it's stirring interest in the whole industry, including Cramer-fave semiconductor equipment makers Lam Research and Applied Materials,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""They'll both probably get orders from Micron.""
Similarly, buyers are paying premiums for rail, freight and airline stocks as the airlines hint at price increases and the rails see stronger delivery trends, Cramer said.
The market's supply is most clearly embodied by retailers like J.Jill, a newly public apparel company that cut its fiscal third-quarter earnings outlook on Thursday.
""The company had been viewed as a survivor doing better than the other stores in the mall. Instead, we can only conclude that the mall traffic took one more leg down in the month of September,"" Cramer said. ""So, of course, that's another reason to buy the stock of Amazon.""
As for the financials, Cramer suggested investors wait until all of the big banks report and the sellers realize that consumers are poised to get more credit than before.
""Don't forget that this market is fickle. Sure, oil and retail have been a continual disappointment, but supply does come out in tech and transports,"" Cramer said. ""As for the banks? They've run a huge amount. It looks like they're now going to give you a chance to scale into them at a lower level. ... My advice: never buy on day one of a big sell-off or day two, either, which would be [Friday]. There will most definitely be more supply behind it.""

42,2017-11-09,Top analysts are betting on these AI growth stocks  ,"Getty Images
 Facebook and Micron are among the favorite ways to play the boom in artificial intelligence, according to top technology analysts. 
 The analysts were identified by looking at the average return of their recommendations and their success rate in those calls, as tracked by TipRanks, a Wall Street analyst database.
Here are five favorite AI stocks recommended by the best-performing technology analysts.
 1) Microsoft (MSFT)
In 2017, Microsoft changed its strategy from a ""mobile-first and cloud-first world"" to ""an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with AI."" And this strategy shift seems to be paying off. The company is now one of the leaders in AI, and has just teamed up withl Amazon to offer developers new tools to develop and share open source AI software.
In the last three months, 13 top analysts have published buy ratings on Microsoft shares, versus just one hold rating.
One bullish analyst is Oppenheimer's Timothy Horan. Following strong earnings results for the quarter, he assigned a buy rating to Microsoft on October 26. He also raised his price target to $92, from $80.
""Microsoft is focused on embedding all products and services with AI capabilities. Microsoft has proven it can execute on its hybrid cloud strategy, and we expect accelerating growth on both the top and bottom lines,"" says Horan. The analyst has a proven track record on Microsoft with a 100 percent success rate and 25 percent average return across his 11 Microsoft ratings.
2) Yext (YEXT)
Yext is a fast-growing tech company that makes it possible for restaurants, banks, doctors, and other businesses to centrally control online data in near real time. On November 5, KeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin assigned a buy rating to Yext with a $16 price target. Given that the stock is currently trading at just $12, this suggests upside of 33 percent for the next 12 months.
Voice search and AI are underappreciated positive factors ""that could sustain high revenue growth for Yext in excess of 30 percent for an extended period of time, in our view,"" the analyst said.
Overall, this 'Strong Buy' stock has received three recent buy ratings from top-ranked analysts. With shares down 20 percent, the risk/ reward appears increasingly compelling say analysts. TipRanks shows that the average analyst price target of $17 suggests potential gains of over 40 percent from the current share price.
3) Facebook (FB)
Social media giant Facebook says it ""wants to solve AI."" The company boasts an impressive AI research team led by deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun and has listed AI as one of its major initiatives for 2018.
In the last three months, FB has received 29 buy ratings from analysts and only two bearish ratings. The average price target from these analysts is $207, which suggests big upside potential of 15 percent from the current price.

 Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena reiterated his buy rating with a $215 price target on November 2. ""FB has the largest audience platform in the world at a time when the advancement in deep neural network science, or artificial intelligence, is setting up for a very different computing era,"" he said.
Facebook is already helping Intel develop its long-awaited computer chips to power AI projects. Intel says the chip will be the first in the world specific to neural networks. 
4) Micron (MU)
Micron is one of the world's three biggest memory companies (Samsung and SK Hynix being the other two). Together these three companies control over 80 percent of the $122 billion global memory chip market at a time of worldwide memory shortage.
The stock has 22 buy ratings and only 2 hold ratings in the last three months. Meanwhile, even with shares exploding by 100 percent year to date, the average analyst price target of $52 suggests MU still has upside potential.
""We believe this global memory chip shortage is set to continue until the end of 2018, at the least"" writes Cyrus Mewawalla the managing director of CM Research. He says demand for DRAM chips and NAND flash chips comes from ""new and powerful technology cycles"" such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality.
For example, MU chips are used to power self-driving vehicles and help the car's systems detect hazards on the road. Specifically, Micron says it is already shipping its fastest LPDDR4x memory to ""multiple automotive customers,"" enabling system bandwidth speeds of 100 GB per second.
5) Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)
Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai claims Google has an ""AI first"" future. In the company's most-recent post-earnings call he told analysts: ""It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for a billion people a day.""
Indeed, the company is the most active acquirer of AI, according to research firm CB Insights. In 2017 alone, Alphabet has picked up predictive analytics platform Kaggle, Bangalore based Halli Labs and the computer vision specialist startup AIMatter.
Google is using its AI technology to make existing products like email and search smarter. It is also releasing a constant stream of AI products including Google Lens (a camera that can recognize what it sees), smart speakers and wireless headphones that incorporate Google Assistant.
In the last three months, Alphabet has received 24 buy ratings and just 3 hold ratings from top analysts. The average analyst price target on Alphabet of $1,159 is 11 percent higher than the current share price.

 Pointing to a 1.5 percent decline in the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) last week (down 1 percent Monday) and a 31 percent increase since January, strategist Jim Strugger suggests there may be a hidden buying opportunity.
""We think helpful seasonality aiding an already strong equity market will produce strength right into the new year and expect technology to recover quickly from this pullback,"" wrote Strugger on Monday. ""Micron Technology is a name we like getting long on recent weakness. The stock dropped 15.5 percent from its high last Friday.""

50,2017-12-15,"Traders betting big on three tech stocks, including Micron, ahead of earnings next week  ","Traders are making bullish bets using options on Mircon, Red Hat and Paychex ahead of earnings next week.
 Chipmaker Micron reports earnings on Tuesday after the bell.
In the past week investors have bought more than 11,000 calls with a December 48 strike price in Micron, according to Jon Najarian, Najarian Family Office co-founder and ""Halftime Report"" contributor. These calls expire next Friday, so it's a relatively short-term bet. Micron closed at $42.24 on Thursday, so the stock would have to pop nearly 14 percent to hit $48 by next Friday.
 Kai Pfaffenbach | Reuters
 Traders can use call options to capitalize on a stock's move higher while simultaneously limiting their downside risk. 
If Micron doesn't hit $48 by next Friday the traders will only lose the price they paid for the call option - typically a fraction of what it would cost to buy the stock - plus the commission fee. On the flip side, should Micron blow past $48, the call-option gives traders the right to buy the stock at $48 instead of the higher level.
Najarian spotted other interesting options activity in software company Red Hat, which also reports earnings on Tuesday after the bell.
This month traders bought more than four thousand January 130 calls that expire on January 19. As of Thursday's close Red Hat was trading at $126.13, so to hit $130 it would have to rise 3 percent. Shares of the Raleigh, North Carolina-based company are up more than 80 percent this year.
Traders are also predicting that Paychex moves higher after reporting positive earnings.
This month traders have bought nearly 27,000 calls at the January 70 strike price, according to Najarian. The payroll-processing company reports earnings on Thursday before the bell, and according to FactSet estimates, analysts are expecting earnings per share of 59 cents on $823.5 million in revenue. These calls, which expire January 18, were trading at $0.57 at the start of the month. As of Thursday's close, they were at $1.38.
Elsewhere in the market, Najarian and his brother Pete Najarian, Investitute co-founder, have seen heavy options activity in AT&T and Wells Fargo.

 There is actually some good news in the market and the chip industry.
 Amid the focus on the market's recent volatility, Micron announced better-than-expected guidance on Monday.
The memory chipmaker raised its fiscal second-quarter 2018 revenue forecast range to $7.2 billion to $7.35 billion from its previous target of $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion. Micron also increased its earning per share guidance for the quarter to $2.70 to $2.75 from $2.51 to $2.65.
 Micron shares closed up 7.5 percent Tuesday.
The company also announced Monday it has appointed David Zinsner as its chief financial officer, effective Feb. 19, replacing Ernie Maddock.
KeyBanc Capital Markets raised its rating to overweight from sector weight for Micron shares, following the announcements.
""Micron preannounced F2Q (Feb.) positively amid strong DRAM pricing,"" semiconductor analyst Weston Twigg wrote in a note to clients Monday. ""We are raising our estimates to reflect the preannouncement, and we're upgrading to Overweight as valuation and long-term trends are too compelling to ignore.""
Micron will report its earnings results on March 22.
