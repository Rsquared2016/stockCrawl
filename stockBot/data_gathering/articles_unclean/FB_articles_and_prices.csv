 Then-candidate Donald Trump made American jobs a hyper-politicized issue, and even though unemployment is low, it's still big news when Carrier lays off workers in Indiana or when Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn eyes Midwestern states to possibly create thousands of new jobs. 
 States and localities spend aggressively to lure private investment: one academic study estimated $70 billion per year — and that was before the Great Recession prompted some governors and mayors to double down on tax-break offers.
About half the states have enacted special tax breaks for data centers, also known as ""server farms,"" where the cloud of computing data resides. When we examined 11 incentive packages given to data centers for some of the nation's most prominent internet companies (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon Web Services), we found costs of almost $2 million per job.

 Yet 10 states with special data center tax breaks still fail to disclose even the aggregate annual cost in lost revenue. A new government sunshine rule (see below) should change that for states like Alabama, Indiana, Iowa, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.

 In Mississippi we examined the total cost of Nissan's auto assembly plant in Canton. Taxpayers remembered a special state legislature vote for a $295 million package. But when we examined local property tax abatements and state payroll-tax diversions, we found the cost was more than four times higher: $1.3 billion, making it the costliest ""transplant"" deal in U.S. history.
We know that Shelby County in Tennessee (which includes Memphis) grants about one third of all the property-tax abatement deals in the entire state. But the state's disclosure system, while it names corporate recipients, fails to reveal dollar values.
Using the Shelby example, we can't say what share of the revenue loss is suffered by any city, county or school district. But a new accounting rule, GASB 77, will change that — and lost property taxes matter greatly in a state with no personal income tax.
 Time to upend conventional wisdom on 'corporate welfare'
 Taxpayers are about to gain hard data on economic development tax breaks. Tens of thousands of governments will reveal tens of billions of dollars in spending never disclosed before. The data may rewrite the book and challenge conventional wisdom about ""corporate welfare"" spending.
 America's Top States for Business 2017: The full list
 The accounting rule is Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 77 on Tax Abatement Disclosures. GASB is the group best known for requiring states and localities to disclose how much they owe for retiree pensions and health care. GASB is actually not a government body, but rather a professional standard-setting body that controls Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, for the public sector. Governments adhere to GAAP for three main reasons: Some states mandate it, Wall Street likes GAAP accounting when it gives credit ratings, and some federal aid requires it.
GASB 77 took effect for calendar 2016 and beyond, so as governments close their books and report the prior year's spending, most will include a note, pursuant to Statement 77, disclosing how much revenue they lost to each economic development tax-break program. Because most cities, counties and school districts are on fiscal years ending June 30, most of this new data will arrive late this year.

 We expect the new data will reveal sharp differences and lots of hidden surprises. But the data will be crude and hard to access. Governments won't be required to name company names; they will only report one dollar figure per program per year. And in all but one state, the data will reside in individual governments' financial reports, usually in PDF documents.
Only New Mexico, thanks to State Auditor Tim Keller, has committed to collecting GASB 77 data electronically and making it accessible online. Keller, a former state senator whose incentive disclosure bills were vetoed by both a Democratic and Republican governor, wants taxpayers to immediately enjoy a more informed debate about the state's actual spending priorities.
Good Jobs First is also soon to launch Subsidy Tracker 2, where we will collect and publish GASB 77 data. (Our longstanding Subsidy Tracker database collects company-specific incentive data.)
In all 50 states, the GASB 77 data will likely spawn a whole new cottage industry of journalists, academics and nonprofits ""wrangling"" the data, then analyzing it from many perspectives.
Taxpayers will be enriched by the ensuing debate.

 });Economic liberty is why the Lone Star State leads in job creation and in population growth over the last 10 years and why personal incomes have risen almost twice as fast in Texas compared to New York and well ahead of California.
 That's also why Texas was recently named by CNBC as the Top State of the Decade, the ""Top of the Tops"" for business.
Restrained government, lower taxes, smarter regulations, right-to-work laws and litigation reform — these are the pro-growth economic policies that help free enterprise flourish and that attract major employers to Texas every day.
 Source: Apple
One of two Apple campuses in Austin. Texas' Apple operations are second only to the Cupertino/Bay Area in California. Apple employs more than 8,000 people in the Lone Star State.
 As the 10th-largest economy among the nations of the world and home to 50 Fortune 500 headquarters, Texas offers a business-friendly climate — with no corporate income tax and no personal income tax — along with a highly skilled workforce, easy access to global markets, robust infrastructure and predictable regulations. Texas offers a framework where innovation, technology and diverse industries thrive.
As a result, more Texans have jobs today than ever before. In fact, more Texans are working than 46 other states have residents.

""Made in Texas"" is a powerful label, and the Lone Star State is the top-exporting state, now for 15 years in row, and the top tech-exporting state, again beating second-place California. Texas also has the second-largest labor force, and our population continues to expand following a wave of corporate and regional headquarters relocations as businesses flee states that overtax and overregulate.
Even with the drop in oil production last year, the Texas economy grew. In fact, in terms of real GDP annualized growth, Texas was the fastest-growing state in the fourth quarter. This resiliency is a testament to the diversity of the economy and the state's tremendous economic momentum.
CEOs who relocate to Texas cite the differences as night and day when it comes to the improved quality of life and good schools, along with the job-ready workforce. Lower energy costs, together with lower land costs and fewer land-use restrictions, mean lower operating costs for businesses and a lower cost-of-living for their employees.
 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott
 ""From biotech and defense tech to wearable tech and clean tech, technologies developed in the Lone Star State are changing the world in which we live.""
 Those are some of the advantages that helped Texas win the Governor's Cup for the most new and expanded corporate facility projects in the nation — for the fifth year in a row. Over the past year, Texas welcomed Kubota Tractors, Farmer Brothers and Serenova, along with new facilities for Amazon, Facebook and GM Financial, to name just a few. Tech giants Apple, Oracle, Google and Microsoft are also expanding their corporate presence and jobs in Texas' innovation corridor.
In fact, Texas is in the middle of an innovation renaissance. From biotech and defense tech to wearable tech and clean tech, technologies developed in the Lone Star State are changing the world in which we live.
Texas is also where the tech talent wants to live, with Austin, San Antonio, Houston and Dallas ranking among the top metro areas for startup activity.
The Texas model is proof that limited government secures economic liberty and encourages unlimited opportunity.
To spur even greater economic expansion, I will continue to fight back against overregulation by the federal government and rein in regulatory regimes at the local level that create a patchwork of compliance complexities.
The freedom to experiment with new business models, like transportation network companies, should be permitted by default. Across industries, we need to remove barriers to entry, encourage competition, enact consistent consumer safety regulations and then empower consumers to choose.
By unleashing the power of entrepreneurs and innovators, and securing the freedom to aspire, Texas will long remain the best state for business.

 Stumbling technology stocks could soon face another hurdle if the Federal Reserve follows through on raising interest rates, Credit Suisse strategists said. 
 ""The performance of FAANG stocks [Facebook, Apple, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google's parent Alphabet] relative to the broader market has moved inversely with interest rate direction since 2003,"" Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, and Sara Mahaffy, vice president of U.S. equity strategy at the firm, said in a Monday report. 
The inverse relationship implies ""a move higher in interest rates in 2H17 could be a challenge for the group,"" the note said.
 Correlation between FAANG relative performance and 10-year yield
 Source: Credit Suisse US Equity Strategy, Thomson Reuters/Eikon, S&P Capital IQ/ClariFi, as of June 2017
The Credit Suisse analysis said the exact mathematical correlation between the relative performance of the big internet stocks and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is negative 86 percent. When a correlation is 100 percent that means two assets move in sync. A correlation close to negative 100 percent means two assets move in nearly opposite directions.

 Tech sell-off is a buying opportunity: MKM's Jonathan Krinsky   
 12:37  PM ET Mon, 10 July 2017 |  03:10 
 Exactly one year ago,  the 10-year Treasury yield hit a multidecade low that several strategists don't expect markets will see in the near future. Although the upward climb since then has been bumpy, strategists generally expect yields to move higher given improving global growth, potential government stimulus and tighter monetary policy. 
Global sovereign bond yields climbed in the last several weeks after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said ""reflationary forces are at play."" In the U.S., traders expect the Federal Reserve to raise the benchmark interest rate at least one more time this year, and begin reducing balance sheet holdings.
Tech stocks have the greatest weighting in the S&P 500 and can easily direct the overall market performance. The sector has surged more than 18 percent this year as the best S&P 500 performer, but struggled in the last several weeks as traders worried big tech names may be getting too expensive. 
Over the last 30 trading days, technology is only the fourth-best performer in the S&P 500. The benchmark index last hit a record nearly a month ago on June 19. 
Tech traded slightly higher Tuesday, on pace for weekly gains of more than 1 percent.
However, the ""tech bounce [is] likely short lived,"" Fundstrat Technical Strategist Robert Sluymer said in a Tuesday note. ""Our longer-term cycle indicators continue to suggest downside risk heading into August and the Fall."" 
Some of those indicators, Sluymer said, include the economic surprise index for G-10 economies that is ""collapsing from peak levels"" and a falling percentage of stocks with positive momentum.

 Software developers are impressed with Facebook's lead over Snapchat's platform, which may signal more bad news for Snap, according to advertising mogul Martin Sorrell.
 ""If you went to the app developers' conference on the West Coast, at Facebook, the people who I spoke to came away from that saying that Facebook was very successfully countering Snap,""  said Sorrell, CEO of advertising giant WPP, which has over 205,000 employees around the world.
In a rare move, Morgan Stanley analysts downgraded Snap on Tuesday, lowering their price target to $16 from $28.
 ""We have been wrong about SNAP's ability to innovate and improve its ad product this year,"" the analysts wrote.
 Brendan McDermid | Reuters
A woman wears Snapchat's Spectacles on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the company's initial public offering in New York, March 2, 2017.
 Although Morgan Stanley's analysts are separate from the underwriters, Morgan Stanley is one of the firms that took Snap public and priced the IPO.
""That was pretty much a seminal moment,"" Sorrell told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday. Snap shares have languished below their $17 IPO price this week but rose slightly on Wednesday morning.
Facebook and fellow advertiser Google also face issues, Sorrell said. The pair has worked to prevent ads from being shown next to controversial and extremist content, and Google, especially, is still being pressured, according to Sorrell. 
But he said that WPP's clients are still spending gobs more cash on Facebook and Google than on Snapchat. 
Last year, WPP spent about $100 million on Snap, and Sorrell said that could grow to $200 million this year. But WPP's spending on Facebook was about $1.7 billion last year and will be ""well over"" $2 billion this year, Sorrell said. He added that WPP's spending on Google should grow from under $5 billion last year to between $5.5 billion and $6 billion this year.
""Snap obviously has been copied — plagiarized, you could say — by Facebook, and very successfully so,"" Sorrell said.
Paul Meeks, chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Sloy Dahl & Holst, said that Snap should have waited to go public since its business model was too immature and susceptible to copying by Facebook's Instagram app.
""I think Facebook is the one to buy, and if you think about Snap, slap yourself and just buy some more Facebook,"" Meeks said.

 Mark Zuckerberg couldn't buy Snapchat years ago, and now he's close to destroying the company   
 4:44  PM ET Wed, 12 July 2017 |  00:43 
 In late 2013, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel reportedly rebuffed a $3 billion takeover offer from Mark Zuckerberg.
 Now the Facebook CEO may be having the last laugh.
Snap shares fell sharply below their IPO price of $17 a share this week, after one of the investment banks that helped take the company public downgraded its stock over worries about Instagram.
 The downgrade of Snapchat's parent firm by Morgan Stanley came one business day after Facebook's rival Instagram service introduced what it called its ""fun new face filter.""
The feature, which allows users to personalize photos with realistic-looking digital elements, was just the latest in a long list of tools Instagram has rolled out to blunt Snapchat's growing appeal to younger users.
In the time since Spiegel spurned Zuckerberg, Facebook has turned Instagram — a photo-sharing service it acquired in 2012 for just $1 billion — into a key growth driver and a Snapchat killer.
And it's done it with product updates — from photo filters to digital sunglasses — that appeal to the same youthful demographic Spiegel used to build up Snapchat.
""The death knell for Snapchat was Instagram Stories,"" said David Pierpont, vice president of performance media for Ansira, a digital ad agency with more than 100 clients, referring to a video-sharing feature launched last August. 
""When we saw that, we said, 'It's over,'"" Pierpont told CNBC in a phone interview.
It's not just that Instagram can mimic Snapchat features, Pierpont says, but that when combined with Facebook's own service, it can offer advertisers access to more than 2 billion users, as well as detailed data about their online ""likes"" and habits.

 Instagram's growth surge
 Instagram's growth has accelerated markedly in the last year.
Last month, the number of people who use Instagram Stories every day reached 250 million, up from 200 million in April. That's a growth rate of 25 percent in just one quarter.
It's also well ahead of Snap, which reported 166 million average daily users in the first quarter of 2017, for a year-over-year growth rate of 36 percent.
Apart from Stories, the overall Instagram service also has been growing fast. In April, Instagram said it had 700 million users, up from 500 million in June 2016. That's an addition of 200 million in 10 months.
For most of 2014 and all of 2015, Instagram had been adding roughly 100 million every nine months.
""There was a major push within Facebook to get more users on Instagram,"" said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy, an industry analyst firm.
Facebook did so by sending messages to users telling them which of their friends were already on Instagram.
""It was the right strategy and it worked,"" Moorhead told CNBC.
Now even Morgan Stanley, which was one of the investment banks that helped underwrite Snap's IPO, is admitting in a note this week that ""Instagram is likely to be more disruptive than previously expected"" to Snapchat's prospects.
The stock downgrade and revenue-estimate cut was a rare move on Wall Street given that the giant investment bank helped sell Snap's IPO just four months ago.
And Facebook will keep turning up the heat on its smaller rival.
Some Instagram advertisers are now getting for free a type of sponsorship that they have to pay for on Snapchat, according to the Morgan Stanley note.
""It's going to be hard for Snap to become more than a niche player"" in the online ad market, Pierpont said.

We continue to work to overcome the effects of strong economic headwinds, such as federal budget cuts, the national recession and slumping oil and gas revenue. In the face of these challenges, private-sector job growth is on the rise in our state and we're working to build a sturdier foundation that will make us stronger when the economic storms of the future come our way.
 Thanks to a relentless commitment to making New Mexico more competitive for jobs and investment, we're seeing encouraging signs. Through fiscal responsibility and bold reforms, we balanced the budget without raising taxes — in fact, we've even cut taxes 37 times.
We've streamlined regulations, built up tools that help businesses grow and thrive, and we're recruiting companies to New Mexico from all over the world. Just last fall, Facebook announced they're bringing a massive high-tech data center to New Mexico — and with it thousands of long-term construction jobs and more than $1 billion in private-sector investment — with the potential for future phases, with even more jobs and investment.

Facebook’s planned Los Lunas data center in New Mexico will create thousands of construction jobs. Over time the company’s investment could reach as high as $1 billion.

While the word spreads far and wide that New Mexico is a great place to do business and invest, we're also helping New Mexico's homegrown businesses expand across a diverse spectrum of industries. Companies like Meow Wolf, Skorpios, Descartes Labs, Risksense and many others are investing right here in New Mexico and creating new jobs for our families.

When I took office, our job training program was grossly underfunded — as was our closing fund, another valuable tool for investing in infrastructure and capital improvements to allow New Mexico to compete. I knew we needed to do things differently to compete with other states, so I fought to grow our closing fund to $56 million and expanded funding for our job training program to $12 million. It's now ranked as one of the top five workforce development programs in the nation. Tools like these help ensure our state has the workforce and infrastructure that companies need to help our communities thrive.
Reform isn't easy, but our families and communities deserve nothing less. By treating businesses fairly and working together to grow and diversify our economy, we're recruiting more companies and jobs, investing more in our communities and making our state a better place.
The fight to diversify New Mexico's economy isn't the easy way out, but a brighter economic future for our families is worth it.

3,2017-07-17,Facebook’s HR chief discusses 5 key tenets of its winning culture  ,"As your team or company grows, it might naturally become more difficult to feel connected to your boss and coworkers.
 But Facebook — once a 10-person team, now made up of 18,770 employees — has a secret to balancing growth and staying true to its mission, according to its vice president of people Lori Goler: its company culture.
In a conversation with Glassdoor, Goler offers five ways Facebook's culture fuels its overall success:
 Being mission-focused
 Goler says that when she first joined the company nine years ago, she noticed the leadership team's substantial focus on culture.
""The culture is in support of the mission,"" Goler tells Glassdoor. ""We have seen the way that our community of users uses the products to build community, and we use it ourselves to build community internally. It all feels very much in sync.""

 });
 Goler adds that when she is recruiting and interviewing prospective Facebook employees, the company's culture and mission are ""a really big part of our value proposition.""
Former Facebook employee Kevin Colleran, once the company's longest-serving employee after founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, had a similar takeaway. He writes in the Wall Street Journal that he witnessed the company grow ""tremendously — both in terms of revenues and headcount — while never losing focus on the critical nature of culture.""

 Former Facebook employee on what he learned from the intense hiring process   
 11:35  AM ET Wed, 25 Jan 2017 |  00:47 
 Playing to employees' strengths
 Facebook uses self-assessments and exit interviews to understand how employees feel about their work while also figuring out ways to help them excel.""The thing that separates people who stay for a long time or who make the choices to leave is how they score themselves on whether they're playing to their strengths,"" Goler tells Glassdoor.
She adds that when employees feel proud about the work they do at Facebook, they are contributing back to the company's overall mission.
Part of identifying an employee's strengths is understanding their downfalls. In one episode of LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman's podcast, ""Masters of Scale,"" Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg says a resilient organization like Facebook is born from embracing employees' failures.
 Sandberg Hoffman tweet
 ""You have to be open to feedback. You have to ask for feedback. You have to build in a culture where, when I think you need to do something better, or you think I need to do something better—we tell each other and tell each other directly, and work it out,"" Sandberg tells Hoffman.
 Supporting life outside of work
 Goler tells Glassdoor that Facebook seeks to ""build a set of policies that support [being good workers, family members and friends] in every stage of life.""
A few ways Facebook caters to employees' personal lives include extended bereavement leave, extended parental leave and the company's new headquarters that will have housing, a grocery store and a pharmacy, among other features.
 Having an authentic boss
 If workers are genuinely invested in their jobs, they are more likely to perform better, be more engaged and feel more satisfied, one study shows.
Goler says Zuckerberg's authenticity and humanity influences the workforce at Facebook. ""Mark is so human and so authentic with our team,"" Goler tells Glassdoor. ""He does a Q&A every Friday. He shows up as he is: The person that you see, his public persona, is the same thing we see internally. You see the warmth and the transparency in his posts; we see the same thing.""
 Expecting workers to take initiative
 While the company provides the goals it wants to reach, employees have to figure out how to reach those on their own. Goler says that this level of autonomy reminds employees of the value their contributions bring to Facebook.
The company has a culture in which ""you don't have to have a huge amount of experience to be able to do big things,"" Zuckerberg told Fast Company in an interview a few years ago.
""That's been helpful in terms of being able to give really talented folks who haven't run big things before big roles in the company, and giving them a chance to either show that they can do it, or not,"" Zuckerberg says.

4,2017-07-18,Mark Zuckerberg: Government social services should 'give people the dignity and confidence to be entrepreneurial'  Group Nine Media CEO: It's still the early innings for companies like Netflix and Facebook  ,"Entrepreneurship has been good to Mark Zuckerberg. At 33 years old, the Facebook founder and CEO is worth north of $66 billion, according to Forbes.
 Perhaps that's why he's on a mission help others become entrepreneurial.
During the most recent stop on his tour of all 50 U.S. states, at the Blackfeet Nation reservation in Browning, Montana, Zuckerberg used the community to illustrate how important comprehensive, smart social services are, as they help give people the support and freedom they need to thrive in business.
 It's important to ""set up these services well to give people the dignity and confidence to be entrepreneurial rather than making them feel helpless and dependent,"" says Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.
On the reservation, economic depression has resulted in an epidemic of drug and alcohol abuse among the people of Blackfeet and a life expectancy 20 years less than the national average, Zuckerberg says. Corruption in the tribal courts hinders outsiders from opening businesses in the area.

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 ""The result is a feeling of helplessness,"" he writes.
Social services could help change that on the reservation, and in the rest of the country, according to Zuckerberg.
 ""A lot of what I saw comes back to the basic idea of freedom,"" explains Zuckerberg.
""If people have the freedom to do what they want — whether that's taking a chance on a new idea or building their community — the inherent creativity and goodness in people will help different parts of society flourish.""
Zuckerberg makes a similar claim  in his graduation speech at Harvard in May. He says part of what allowed him to learn to code as a teenager was that his parents supported him financially (his dad was a dentist). Because of that, he believes on a larger scale, billionaires like him ought to be paying for a social backstop like universal basic income.
 ""An entrepreneurial culture thrives when it's easy to try lots of new ideas,"" Zuckerberg says in the speech.
""I know lots of people who haven't pursued dreams because they didn't have a cushion to fall back on if they failed. … We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new things.""
Also, at a recent tour stop in Alaska, Zuckerberg commended the state's cash handout program, funded by oil revenues.
""Seeing how Alaska put this dividend in place reminded me of a lesson I learned early at Facebook: organizations think profoundly differently when they're profitable than when they're in debt. When you're losing money, your mentality is largely about survival,"" writes Zuckerberg. ""But when you're profitable, you're confident about your future and you look for opportunities to invest and grow further.""
Zuckerberg is not alone in his calling for universal basic income. Elon Musk, for example, has said that he thinks universal basic income will be a necessity in the face of massive job loss as robots replace lower-skilled jobs.

 For one venture capital expert who works with start-ups every day, the lesson from the tweet was important: You don't have to be perfect to get started.
 Michael Carney, an associate at early-stage venture capital firm Upfront Ventures, which has investments in dozens of companies, is talking about a business strategy called minimum viable product — the idea is that once founders create the simplest form of their idea that will work, they should get it out there in the public.
The first iteration of an idea or business ""is never going to be perfect,"" Carney tells CNBC. ""There is never a perfect time to launch, and eventually you have to get something out in the market and get feedback.""

 It's similar to Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's famous ""move fast and break things"" mantra, a very popular mentality in Silicon Valley, and for good reason.
""Ideas don't come out fully formed,"" says Zuckerberg in a recent commencement speech at Harvard. ""They only become clear as you work on them. You just have to get started. If I had to understand everything about connecting people before I began, I never would have started Facebook,"" he says.
LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman notes Zuckerberg's willingness to take quick action in an interview with the executive on his podcast, ""Masters of Scale.""
 ""You just have to get started.""
-Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook
 ""He has no qualms about rushing out an imperfect product,'"" Hoffman says on the podcast. ""If you are Steve Jobs, you can wait for your product to be perfect, but there are almost no Steve Jobs in the world.""
Hoffman himself knows something about starting successful ventures. In addition to co-founding LinkedIn, Hoffman is a partner at technology-focused venture capital firm Greylock Partners, which has invested in companies such as Airbnb, Pandora and Instagram. 
In a LinkedIn post about his interview with Zuckerberg, he writes, ""I've long believed that if you're not embarrassed by your first product release, you've released too late.""
Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, has a similar motto. In her best-selling book, ""Lean In,"" she writes, ""done is better than perfect.""
As for Amazon – while the website was probably pretty well done by 1995's internet standards – Carney says the simplicity of its first offering was the right move.
""If the founding team in 1995 said, 'We are going to be the everything store that sells groceries and books and cloud services,' then they never would have gotten there,"" Carney tells CNBC.

 Cramer Remix: Snap is the No. 1 reason to own Facebook   
 7:26  PM ET Wed, 19 July 2017 |  01:08 
 When a caller asked Jim Cramer for his thoughts on the fate of Snap Inc., he did not hesitate to give the social media company a dooming prognosis.
 ""Snap is the No. 1 reason why you want to own Facebook, because we thought that Instagram would be challenged by Snap. It turns out that's not the case,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
On Tuesday, shares of Snap fell to less than half of the stock's all-time high as analyst downgrades mostly related to the company's ability to improve its advertising platform poured in.
 Challenges from Facebook's Instagram continue to push shares lower, despite Snap's new roll-outs of a Maps feature and a daily news show with NBC.
 Tuesday's Deals: Companies on the Defense?
 Jim Bourg | Reuters
Cooking spices manufactured by McCormick & Co.
 The call came after Cramer reviewed Tuesday's news of two separate deals: a potential merger between Discovery and Scripps Networks Interactive and spice company McCormick buying Reckitt Benckiser's food division.
""While the potential Discovery-Scripps deal, at about $10 billion is more than twice the size of the $4.2 billion food transaction ... these are happening for similar reasons. Companies, afraid of losing their relevance and their clout, are merging with their peers or rivals in order to produce stronger entities with more appeal to their masters, meaning their distributors and their ultimate customers,"" Cramer said.
To understand why these two deals are so similar, Cramer compared the companies' distribution methods: Just like you walk through aisles of a supermarket to find products, you scroll through cable offerings to find things to watch.
 Rekindling Investors' Interest

 Despite various investing outlets inciting fear in the stock market about ""single-stock risk,"" Cramer has seen average investors coming out of the woodwork to buy strong individual stocks.
""I know there are tons of statistics showing an almost inexorable decline in interest in the stock market as a whole,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""But there's something afoot right now, right now after nine straight sessions where the Nasdaq has rallied a total of 4.7 percent.""
Lately, more people have been approaching Cramer not just for photos, but for conversations about his view on the market and on specific stocks he has recommended — a good sign, he said.
 Boring, Un-Sexy, Dull... And a Buy?

Equifax building in Atlanta.
 Investors may worry about what is causing the stock market's monster rally, but Cramer insists that it is all about boring stocks like financial technology player Equifax.
Shares of Equifax, one of the country's three biggest credit reporting agencies, have been on fire, rallying almost 20 percent in 2017 and far outpacing the S&P 500 index over the last five years.
How? Equifax makes money from the fees it collects from banks for checking customers' credit scores, selling software to help banks do that, providing workforce solutions for companies' human resources departments, and selling subscription-based credit monitoring and identity theft protection to individual consumers.
The company also uses data and analytics technologies to provide unique insights on over 820 million consumers and over 91 million businesses around the world.
 Edwards Lifesciences CEO: Surgical Evolution
 Scott Mlyn | CNBC 
Michael Mussallem, Edwards Lifesciences
 Then, Cramer sat down with Mike Mussallem, the chairman and CEO of Edwards Lifesciences, to hear more about how the medical device company is continuing to grow.
""There's been a great evolution in technology, and surgery is still very important. And certain patients, really, their life depends on surgery. But this idea came about now almost 20 years ago and the first implant done almost 10 years ago, and it's really revolutionized the treatment for these patients,"" Mussallem told Cramer on Tuesday.
The stock of Edwards has run up 24 percent so far in 2017, so Cramer dug deeper to find out how Mussallem thought the company, which specialized in artificial heart valves, should best be valued.
""The way you want to think about it is the total cost of the procedure,"" the CEO said. ""It's not very often where we have these incredible technologies where you get better outcomes, right, better mortality, less strokes, you get improved quality of life for these patients, which is a big deal, and you have better economics. This is one of those triple wins.""
 Portola Pharmaceuticals: Takeover Potential
 Having skyrocketed 190 percent so far this year, Portola Pharmaceuticals' stock seems to have regained its strength after Jim Cramer dubbed the biotech a disaster just over a year ago.
After Wall Street fell out of love with biotech stocks as a whole several years ago, the stock fell from the $50s to the teens in late 2015. But since the FDA recently granted its leading drug regulatory approval, the stock has been on fire, climbing to nearly $65 as of Tuesday.
""I don't think it's crazy to speculate about a potential takeover here,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""If you're looking to speculate on a relatively young biotech, you have got my blessing here, although ideally I think you should wait for the next market-wide pullback to give you a better entry point. Oh, and given the dearth of new drugs being created by the big pharmaceutical industry companies, I do believe that if Portola has a huge amount of success, it will garner the attention of the big dogs.""
And even if you are not one for speculation, FDA approval is a game-changer for Portola, as it will give the company more solid footing in a market still wary of development-stage biotechs, Cramer said.
 Lightning Round: I Want More From This Pharma Name
 In Cramer's lightning round, he sped through his take on some callers' favorite stocks, including:
Pfizer: ""You know, it's fine. No one ever got hurt buying Pfizer. I'd like to see some new products out of there or a big acquisition or maybe the split-up that they've been talking about, but it's not going to run away from you, believe me.""
Forterra: ""Yeah, it's a pipe company, and the problem with a pipe company is if you go back over the CSX presentation this morning, they said pipe sales, their actual cargo, are way down. I don't want to be involved with that. Too much pipe involved with infrastructure. Let's see what Nucor says when they report to see if there's hope for infrastructure. I'm not clear.""

 });Ben Gomes, Vice President of Search Engineering at Google, at the Googleplex campus in Mountain View.
 Google is making its mobile app look more like a news feed as it battles Facebook and Amazon for the attention of -- and information about -- online consumers.
 This week the technology giant updated its app to add content from more sources. For example, data on local events, eateries and weather will be available alongside regular search results.
Users will also be able ""follow"" an area of interest with the touch of a button. Having users input this information could help Google further tailor search results and offer better information to advertisers. This could help Google compete in mobile advertising against Facebook, which collects detailed information about users based on their likes and preferences, then uses this information to target ads.
 Google, a unit of Alphabet, also tweaked how it presents this information, especially for users of its Pixel smartphone, who can access the feed by ""swiping left"" from their home screen. It looks more like news feeds from Facebook, Twitter, or Apple News, and features ""cards"" with specific sets of information like sports scores and news headlines. Some of these cards will contain information from other Google services, like YouTube.
The idea is to make the feed ""an extension of Google search,"" said Shashidhar Thakur, vice president of search, in a presentation to reporters earlier this week. The goal is ""to keep you in the know even when you're not searching,"" Thakur said.
The updates to a format Google first unveiled last December come a day after Amazon unveiled Spark, its own feed of product photos and stories designed to help subscribers to its Prime service find products to buy more easily.
And they come more than a year after Facebook first began experimenting with a new shopping tab in its own news feed.
 Mobile requires 'bite-sized answers,' says Google search VP
 All three technology giants are looking for new ways to engage with mobile consumers.
While Google now sells everything from videos to smartphones, it still got 87 percent of its first quarter revenue from selling ads. 
But with more people searching with mobile phones than PCs, Google is feeling pressure to update its core business.
The shift to mobile means Google has to give users ""bite-sized answers to questions,"" says Ben Gomes, vice president of the company's core search product.
""The vast majority of our queries come from mobile phones,"" Gomes said during a demonstration of the new features for the media in San Francisco on Tuesday.
The changes will come first to the English version of the Google app for Android and iOS. International versions and one for browsers will be added eventually, the company executives said.
When a reporter asked if the company has plans to place ads -- in the form of sponsored posts -- into the feed, Gomes declined to comment.
Here's a couple examples Google showed us of the new feed:
 Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Google changed its feed feature, which appears even when users don't actively search for information.

 The stocks to buy ahead of earnings   
 4:40  PM ET Tue, 18 July 2017 |  03:44 
 As earnings season heats up, strategists say two tech stocks set to report could be head and shoulders above the rest.
 Facebook, set to unveil earnings on Wednesday, July 26th, is a top pick for S&P Global portfolio manager Erin Gibbs. The company has a strong history of surpassing analysts' earnings estimates, she said, and is now trading at a relatively reasonable valuation.
This comes during a period in which analysts are not currently forecasting a substantial amount of growth over the next few months.
 ""This period of temporary lowered outlook and lowered valuations seems like a decent place to get in before [Facebook] starts showing Wall Street they have underestimated one of the better-managed companies in tech,"" she wrote Tuesday in an email to CNBC.
Furthermore, ""Valuation has come down to reasonable levels, at 32 [times] forward earnings, given the lowered growth estimate for the next 12 months."" The estimate for earnings per share over the next 12 months ""is only 3% growth, which sets the bar fairly low.""
According to S&P Global, Facebook has beaten earnings expectations handily over the last year and a half; earnings before taxes have surprised by 17 percent, 11 percent, 9 percent and nearly 5 percent over the last four fiscal quarters. Interestingly enough, Gibbs pointed out, the steady decline in the amount by which earnings beat is a ""normal progression"" for a company with continued larger earnings.
The real growth for the company is likely to come in 2018, Gibbs said, when ""double-digit growth"" is expected, adding that ""if they beat it this quarter, they're still on track — well on track — to really achieving what we want for the following year. And this is a good place to get in.""
For Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray, Advanced Micro Devices looks poised to see a strong upward movement after its earnings announcement next Tuesday.
""The stock has been consolidating and tightening up really since the last quarterly earnings release,"" he pointed out.
 He believes that AMD will break out of this pattern to the upside.
""These patterns typically resolve themselves in the direction of the preceding trend, and that direction is up,"" Johnson said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""
""This stock is very well poised to see a nice, strong move upward after this earnings announcement.""
AMD shares have already risen 19 percent year-to-date. Analysts are expecting earnings of 0.

Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook's head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, said at a industry conference in New York that the social networking giant will launch a subscription-based news product later this year, according to a report from The Street. 
 The Street said the feature is set to be built on top of Facebook's ""Instant Articles,"" which aggregate stories from various publishers, depending on a reader's preferences.
It added that Facebook planned to build a paywall that will require readers to become subscribers to the service after accessing 10 free articles. The service will direct readers to news publishers' home pages. Initial tests will begin in October. 
 Facebook's plans, announced Tuesday, come as the news industry is struggling to remain solvent in the face of free distribution of its information through the internet. Online distribution has also blurred the lines between legitimate news and fake news.
Earlier this month, the industry banded together and asked for a limited antitrust exemption from the U.S. Congress in a bid to fend off growing competition from large social platforms like Facebook and Google.
Brown told CNBC previously Facebook was ""committed to helping quality journalism thrive"" on its platform.

 Facebook is adding the option for publishers to lock Instant Articles shared on the social media service behind a paywall later this year, said Campbell Brown, the company's head of news services, at a conference yesterday  according to The Street.
The new feature will reportedly be built on top of the company's existing Instant Articles feature. Publishers will be able to direct users to sign up for a digital subscription or to lock out readers after they've read 10 articles in a month, similar to the limitations that publications like The New York Times already place on their websites.

According to Brown, the new subscription option is in response to requests from publishers who have been lobbying the company for a paywall for shared articles on Facebook. The new subscription service will reportedly begin tests in October, although details are still slim — including whether or not Facebook will share in the revenue from subscriptions purchased through the application.

""When we pitched our model to American investors a few years ago, all of them disagreed,"" Li told CNBC in Mandarin. ""They think that advertisement is the best revenue model and still refuse to admit that there's actually a better model besides that.""
 Started as an online gaming web portal, YY has transformed itself into an entertainment platform featuring music, live game broadcasting, online dating and education. But what makes YY a leading player in China is its live-streaming feature, which helped set off a sensation in the world's second largest economy.
On paper, the platform naturally competes with other live-video providers like Facebook, YouTube, Twitch and Twitter's Periscope, but its robust social element has also led to comparisons with apps less focused on live like Instagram and Snapchat.
YY's live-streaming app stands out because of its virtual-gifting function: To show their appreciation, audience members can purchase and send pictographs to broadcasters that can be converted into real-world cash. So, for broadcasting activities such as singing, dancing or even eating a pizza, a live-streamer can earn cash-convertible flowers, hearts or Lamborghinis.

 What you need to know about live streaming in China   
 11:24  PM ET Wed, 19 July 2017 |  03:22 
 That may seem like a small feature, but YY's revenue is mostly derived from the sale of virtual gifts: The company takes a cut of the proceeds, and that's fueled rapid growth for the past few years.
The company said its 2016 net revenue increased by 39 percent year-over-year to $1.18 billion, while the company's net profit reached $219 million for a 47.5 percent on-year jump.
Statistics from BigOne Lab, a Chinese alternative data firm, show that the top 10,000 active streamers tracked by the firm contributed approximately 44 percent of YY's second-quarter revenue guidance for 2017.
""[The 10,000 streamers] collectively generated around RMB 12 million (about $1.78 million) in revenue per day from virtual gifts through May and June 2017,"" Mu Chen, CEO of BigOne Lab, wrote to CNBC in a note.
The data firm also found that the top 1,000 streamers earned 69 percent of the sample's total revenue, while the top 5,000 contributed more than 95 percent of the total revenue, demonstrating the streaming platform's reliance on the most popular streaming stars.
Many fear, however, that the company might face a growth slowdown this year, with challenges brought by increasingly intensive competition and tougher regulations from the Chinese government.
""Actually, last year [2016] was the year where we saw our slowest growth. In fact, our growth doubled every year during the first nine years of operation and quadrupled during our best year,"" Li said.
""It will definitely be more and more challenging to keep up such an exponential growth rate in the future,"" he added.
 Domestic regulation: The pros and cons
 One of the chief concerns for YY investors is that further restrictions from the Chinese government may stymie the industry's growth.
On December 1, 2016, China's Ministry of Culture implemented a series of regulations regarding live-streaming platforms in an attempt to improve the overall quality of the content — and prevent lewd material from proliferating.
Regulators ordered that streaming platforms and content providers must obtain qualifications, and live-streaming companies are required to censor certain subjects and have the technical ability to immediately end transmissions.
 Meanwhile, authorities have continued to tighten control this year. In the first half of 2017, China closed 73 illegal live-streaming platforms and imposed lifetime bans on nearly 2,000 live streamers for providing pornographic content. From January to June, more than 120,000 accounts were blocked, according to China's National Office Against Pornographic and Illegal Publications.
While many are questioning how stricter regulation would harm platforms' profitability as some streamers may be scared away, Li said he sees it as a positive push instead of a challenge.
""As everyone has access to live streaming, there's bound to be some trouble-makers,"" said Li. ""Before, the most we can do is to ban your account right? But you can always create another one. The benefit from such regulations is that we can now use the law to deal with these people.""
YY, listed on Nasdaq since 2012, saw a year-to-date return of more than 70 percent as of market close on Tuesday. The company reported in its 2017 first-quarter unaudited financial statement that its total net revenues increased by 37.4 percent year-over-year to 2.27 billion yuan ($336 million) in the first quarter of 2017. It said it expected to achieve net revenue between 2.45 billion and 2.55 billion yuan ($362 million to $377 million) for the second quarter, meaning year-over-year growth between 23.7 percent and 28.7 percent.
 Bigo: Li's international ambition
 Live-streaming apps are booming in China on a scale not yet witnessed in any other market, but it's still a fledgling trend in western countries.
Technology giants like Facebook, Snapchat and Twitter have all launched live-streaming services, but few have convinced the market that they have found a path to profitability.
Not until February this year did Facebook announce its plan to open up paid live broadcasting to the general public. Facebook's main video rival, Alphabet's YouTube, has been paying content-providers a 55-percent share of ad revenues for years, but the company didn't start providing mobile live-streaming services until earlier this year. That function is still only available for content creators with over 10,000 subscribers.
And that's why Li founded Bigo Live in Singapore last year. The platform is largely a clone of YY, and it's an effort to bring the China-tested revenue model overseas in order to grasp market share from Silicon Valley giants.
""We estimate that by the end of this year, Bigo will generate an annual revenue of $300 million, which is a very good performance for a start-up,"" Li said, adding that monetization for the platform came at an early stage.
Explaining that he expects users across the globe to be as willing to pay as those in China, Li said the company believes ""overseas users have the same demand, share the same human nature, and follow the same social logic.""

 11:25  PM ET Wed, 19 July 2017 |  04:39 
 Greater purchasing power, along cultures more outgoing than China's, might bolster the company's growth even faster than its Chinese counterpart, according to Li.
""In overseas markets, users tend to broadcast and socialize more,"" he said.
Data provided by Bigo showed that content creators count for more than 30 percent of all active users. In other words: One out of every three users on the platform is live-streaming his or her content.
""We know Instagram and Snapchat's (content creation) numbers are both below 10 percent, around 4 percent, 6 percent or 8 percent,"" Li told CNBC. ""Yet for us, 30 percent of our users are willing to provide content and I think this is a very valuable resource of the community.""
Since its international debut, Bigo has achieved a user base of 30 million users, with the biggest share of users coming from Southeast Asia, followed by India, the Middle East and Brazil.
 A Wikipedia-like compendium
 When asked about the future of the live-streaming industry, Li said he believes short videos and video-centered content will definitely change the way the world.
Li told CNBC he is also working on a project to digitize all human knowledge into videos.
""We hope to build a video version of Wiki, concentrating all the knowledge, ideas and experiences of human beings,"" said Li.
""I often joke with myself, saying that if people were able to record videos in ancient times, and know how to share and store them, probably we would not have invented written languages,"" he said.
""Again, I firmly believe videos will be one of the most important ways to store human beings' knowledge. This era is definitely coming.""

 MKM Partners derivatives strategist Jim Strugger told investors Facebook is his best current earnings options trade idea. The call comes right after he won big on his Netflix earnings recommendation earlier this week.
 Earnings season is among the most volatile times for short-term traders, and this one will be no exception, with many cult stocks expected by the options market to have double-digit percentage swings in any direction. Netflix shares surged Tuesday after the streaming company reported better-than-expected subscriber gains. The strategist recommended investors buy call options on Monday before the company's earnings announcement. ""Netflix Inc.'s almost 13% jump (vs. NASDAQ up 0.5%) following 2Q earnings Monday night is a reminder that even as internet bellwethers have achieved significant scale they remain volatile around events,"" Strugger wrote in the note to clients Wednesday.Here is the specific Facebook options trade the strategist recommends to maximize your returns.

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook Inc., waves after the morning session during the Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S., on Thursday, July 13, 2017.
 Wall Street analysts have spent the last three months cutting their 2017 profit forecasts for Facebook.
 But you wouldn't know it by looking at a chart of Facebook shares, which are up roughly 40 percent year to date, as the company prepares to release second-quarter results next Wednesday.
Just ahead of its much-anticipated financial report and conference call with CEO Mark Zuckerberg on July 26, the average full-year, 2017 Wall Street earnings estimate on Facebook is $4.85 a share.
 In mid-April, before Facebook reported first-quarter results, that consensus number among the 43 analysts who rate the company's stock was $5.44 per share.
In other words, people who are paid to follow Facebook's business closely think it will earn about 11 percent lower profit this year than they did at the start of the quarter. 
 More video means more ads AND more costs
 An expectation of higher capital expenditures may be one reason why Wall Street has pulled back.
""We continue to expect that full-year 2017 capital expenditures will be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, which is up over 50 percent compared to last year,"" CFO David Wehner said on the company's first-quarter earnings call in May.
""As we look into 2017 and beyond, there are going to be a number of initiatives we believe are valuable ... in the long term that are going to be net negative on our operating margin.""
In particular, Facebook is building more data centers to handle an explosion in the video traffic it hosts on its internet pages.
""Over the past year, daily watch time for Facebook Live broadcasts has grown by more than four times,"" Zuckerberg said on the company's first-quarter conference call on May 3.
And Facebook Live is only one of its video products, representing 20 percent of all video, Zuckerberg said then.
Handling all that web traffic means Facebook is building more facilities to house and cool its Internet servers. The company broke ground on its ninth data center in the first quarter,  Wehner said on the first-quarter call.
Video also has other costs: Zuckerberg also said on that same first-quarter call that Facebook is adding 3,000 workers to sift through its content and remove videos that promote acts of terrorism, other forms of violence and fake news articles.
The company made the announcement after YouTube, the video unit of rival Google, lost some advertisers and had to scramble to keep others that were concerned about damage to their brands should their ads be placed alongside objectionable content.
Finally, the company is reportedly working with publishers to acquire rights for TV-style scripted programming, which adds another new expense.
Thanks to Facebook's rising stock price and analysts' lower profit estimates, the company is now trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33.6 (calculated using expected earnings for this year).
That's high even for a Nasdaq stock and a reminder that although the company is a favorite of growth investors, those concerned about value should be leery of owning its shares.
According to data from Birinyi Associates, the most valuable 100 stocks in the Nasdaq Index are trading for an average price-to-earnings ratio of 20.9, as of last Friday.

Out here in the real world, the fate of enterprises big and small hang on understanding the power of technology: For some — those with difficulty adapting — technology is a dangerous weapon, a persistent and evolving threat that ultimately disrupts a company's future. For others — the ones with vision, nimbleness and adaptability — technology is the tool that unlocks new opportunities for growth and value creation.
Understanding these nuances has never been more important than right now: A company's life cycle today is dramatically compressed. According to  Innosight, in the 1920s, companies lasted an average of 67 years on the S&P 500; by 1965, the average lifespan was 33 years; by 1990, 20 years; and now, the forecast is by 2026, 14 years.

 The implications of this are tectonic. Even as the human race has relied on technology, innovation and research to achieve major strides in longevity, companies have suffered dramatic declines in durability. At a macro level, this means greater volatility as market leadership changes hands more frequently. At a micro level, this means companies will need to revisit how they think about everything from strategic planning to investment horizons to executive tenure. Reinvention, it seems, will be just as important as invention.
Companies that sustain will need to be able to harness seven forces that have come to dominate the new physics of business. These forces are:
 Network effects
 The more people who adopt a solution, the more powerful that solution becomes. We saw this with the Windows Operating System, then with Google Search and AdWords, and more recently with iOS and Android. Facebook, too. Critical mass drives adoption, and adoption drives critical mass. Understanding network effects and embracing the power of platforms is key. Small companies may leverage existing platforms as they incubate and establish and then develop their own: Think Zynga, GoFundMe and others. Snap exploited an unmet need in Facebook's platform, and while the jury is still out on its long-term influence, today it's worth about $21 billion.

 7:03  AM ET Fri,  3 June 2016 |  01:15 
 Audience
 Audience is a more valuable asset today than ever before. Once you've accumulated a large audience, you become a channel for other goods and services. Netflix has done this remarkably well. It originally aggregated other providers' content, developed an audience, understood what they wanted, and now offers original content for them. Over the next few years, Netflix expects that as much as 50 percent of its content will be original programming. Similar dynamics are at play in business-to-business, where ""account control"" is a precious asset. IBM, for example, has created tremendous value for shareholders and customers by acquiring small software companies and distributing their innovations through their enterprise license agreements.
 Software
 As Marc Andreessen predicted, software is eating the world. Software has become a kind of connective tissue enabling new levels of automation and business flexibility not previously possible in a hard-coded world. It requires no real distribution infrastructure, while maximizing innovation at minimal cost. Digital goods become extremely high-value, as a product or a service, from fast food, such as McDonald's new mobile ordering and payment app, to Airbnb's disruption of hospitality, to Tesla's re-imagining of the automobile.
 ""As-a-service""
 Fill-in-the-blank ""_aaS"" is arguably the hottest trend in business, as companies rush to adapt products and distribution to a consumption-based model. In a world in which reinvention is key to survival, the flexibility that comes with consuming goods as services is highly sought after. This isn't just about software, either. Cable and satellite providers are doing the same thing with hardware. The same goes for mobile providers like Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile. Uber and Lyft are transforming the auto industry from an owned model to consumption-based, TaaS, or transportation-as-a-service.
 Data
 If software is the connective tissue, then data is the lifeblood of a company. And with the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the value of data, how to collect it, track it, analyze it and monetize it, cannot be overstated. Simply, the more data you own or have access to, the more power you have. Google pioneered this value proposition, and if you were going to connect the dots between all of Google's seemingly disparate businesses, data is the one consistency. Amazon's AWS and Microsoft's Azure are also predicated on data access. In the industrial world, you could say the same thing about GE and its Predix platform-as-a-service. This may also be a sub-narrative behind Intel's $15 billion acquisition of Mobileye. After all, the company says, the car will soon become a valuable data center on wheels.

 Mobility
 Ten years after the launch of the iPhone, the ubiquity and speed of connectivity and the ever-increasing compute capacity in smaller and smaller forms is changing the ways consumers and businesses operate. Typical consumer behavior is now ""mobile first"": 80 percent of all U.S. mobile phone users own a smartphone, and smartphone consumption in the U.S. has doubled from three years ago, according to  comScore. In China, Tencent's WeChat app has attracted 800 million users for messaging, social networking, payments, gaming and more. Such behavior extends to the enterprise, where mobile apps for business-to-business customers are now common. What's more, the ever-shrinking and pervasiveness of technology, from basic sensors to sophisticated computational devices, is behind the explosive growth of the Internet of Things.
 Cyber security
 None of this matters without security. As networks expand, software takes over more core functionality, business models transition to as-a-Service and the value of data is better understood, threats proliferate. We would argue that while all of this innovation seems to be occurring at breakneck speed, these disruptions would occur even faster absent the friction of deep and well-founded concerns over security. Companies that invest, innovate and excel here have the edge. Ask Amazon or Salesforce.com, companies that don't run the risk of slow customer adoption, a tarnished reputation and potentially huge costs.
So what to do, in this brave new world, to strengthen your brand, maintain relevance, grow your business and extend your longevity?
 Embed these seven forces into your strategy to stay ahead of the innovation curve. Regularly review market structure and industry dynamics with a wide aperture; look in every corner to see where disruption may come from next. Reallocate resources to technology, infrastructure improvement, innovation and re-skilling (e.g., software capabilities). Emphasize reinvention, adaptability and embracing change as tenants of corporate culture Implement a modular enterprise structure where you can swap out parts, when necessary, to address new opportunities and improve efficiency. 
These are the forces governing business today, for good and for bad. How they affect your business might just come down to understanding the difference between ""weapon"" and ""tool.""

 The case for buying stock in innovative FANG companies   
 6:31  PM ET Thu, 20 July 2017 |  01:01 
 Some investors wonder how the FANG stocks, Jim Cramer's acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet, can go higher without good news driving their runs.
 ""Is their recent rally just the greater fool theory writ large, where you buy them today, confident that someone will pay even more for them tomorrow simply because they've got momentum?"" the ""Mad Money"" host asked. ""In this particular case, I think the answer is an emphatic no. The truth is that these companies are constantly innovating, always giving you new earnings-additive reasons to buy their stocks.""
Cramer pointed to Thursday morning's news that Facebook would launch a subscription-based news service, working with various media outlets to aggregate content for its users.
 On top of that, the company is also starting to revamp its video advertising capabilities, and a recent analyst report showed Facebook's Instagram outpacing rival Snap at every turn.
""These are all new earnings per share boosters that give you more reason to buy the darned stock,"" Cramer said.
Amazon also had news to share on Thursday when it announced a deal with struggling retailer Sears to sell Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com and integrate Kenmore Smart appliance with Amazon Alexa.
""Sears, its pathetic partner, doesn't have that much left, but it does have one of the best brand names in appliances. They haven't savaged that. Kenmore's still good. You put Kenmore together with Amazon, you throw in Alexa so you can scream at your washing machine all you want to turn on, and voila, you're off to the races,"" Cramer said.
Fresh off of an unexpectedly strong earnings beat, Netflix created buzz and likely boosted international subscriber numbers with its recently released film ""Okja,"" a star-studded picture by famed South Korean director Bong Joon-ho about a giant, genetically engineered pig.
""Okja was Netflix's final release of the second quarter and I think it's the film that put international sign-ups over the top of domestics,"" Cramer said. ""Right story, right publicity, fabulous knowledge of South Korean culture, all things that the conventional studios reject or just don't even know how to do.""
Alphabet's Google also announced the roll-out of a new function on Wednesday that will personalize its mobile news feed to ""keep you in the know even when you're not searching"" and provide more ""bite-size answers"" to users' searches, according to a Google search executive.
""Now, I'm not saying these stocks can't go down — Alphabet and Netflix both declined [Thursday],"" Cramer said. ""I'm saying that they just keep making news, generating actual events and products that are indeed additive to earnings. Raising-numbers FANG. As long as that continues to happen, these stocks can continue to go higher, and you shouldn't feel foolish for pulling the trigger because they seem to introduce needle movers every single day of the week.""

 });Mark Zuckerberg is 33 years old, worth almost $70 billion, according to Forbes, and is running one of the largest, most influential tech companies in the world.
 Why and how is he so successful? Luck has a lot to do with it, he says. 
""You don't get to be successful like this just by being hard working or having a good idea,"" admits Zuckerberg during a Facebook Live on Sunday, which he filmed while smoking meat in his Palo Alto, Calif. backyard.
 ""You have to get lucky in today's society in order for that to happen. And that, I think, is a huge issue.""  
Zuckerberg wants everyone to have the opportunity to be entrepreneurial. ""One of the things that I do feel strongly about, and I know a lot of people in my generation agree with, is that we really want to give everyone the opportunity to go pursue what matters to them and to go make a big difference,"" he says during the Facebook live.

 He acknowledges that one of the reasons he was able to do so is because he was raised with a certain amount of privilege and financial security.
""If I had to support my family growing up instead of having time to code, if I didn't know I'd be fine if Facebook didn't work out, I wouldn't be standing here today,"" says Zuckerberg during a Harvard Commencement address in May. 
 Zuckerberg advocates that a social safety net would give everyone the freedom to try new things. One way to do that, he says, is to give cash handouts to every person in the U.S., regardless of employment status. The idea is known as universal basic income (UBI).

 Billionaire tech titan Elon Musk also says that government cash handouts are a virtual inevitability in the U.S., because robots will rapidly replace low-skilled jobs.
Zuckerberg espoused the benefits of free money when he visited Alaska recently as well. The state has a program that distributes excess oil revenues to every citizen as a cash dividend. 
Though a national universal basic income may require an increase in taxes, it's worth it says Zuckerberg on Sunday's Facebook Live. 
 ""Right now, when there are all these people who don't have the opportunity to go pursue their dreams or go build a new business, we all lose,"" he says via Facebook live.
""If you who are watching this had more opportunity to go build something that would be a historic business or enterprise that could serve people all around the world, that would improve the economy and give services to all of us that we could all benefit from.""

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook has acquired a startup to help it crack down on users who share pirated videos and other content without permission. Source3 builds technology to detect intellectual property that has been shared by internet users without permission.
Facebook is acquiring both the technology and at least some of the team behind Source3, which announced the deal on its website. A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on deal terms, though Source3 has raised just $4 million in venture capital funding, according to Crunchbase.
Facebook has had  a lot of issues with pirated content in the past, and it has been two years since the company first announced ""Rights Manager,"" technology to detect and remove video clips shared by people who don't have rights to the video. YouTube offers something similar, though more advanced, called Content ID.
 More from Recode:  Rob Fishman used to connect young stars with advertisers. Now he's making videos with them at his new startup, Brat.  Google is having trouble pushing its Facebook-like news feed to Android devices  Twitter says it's punishing 10 times more users for being abusive than it was a year ago 
In April, Facebook  added another option for rights holders: Leave the content up, and make money off the views that these pirates are generating for you.
Given the acquisition of Source3, it's clear that Facebook hasn't yet perfected its rights management technology. The company would ultimately like to be home to lots of professionally produced video, which is why it's  paying publishers and movie studios to make videos exclusively for the social network. Video creators won't want to keep giving Facebook their videos if people can easily steal them and profit off them.
""We're excited to work with the Source3 team and learn from the expertise they've built in intellectual property, trademarks and copyright,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement shared with Recode. ""As always, we are focused on ensuring we serve our partners well.""
The employees who join Facebook from Source3 will work out of the company's New York office, though it's unknown how many workers that will be. Source3 will be fully integrated into Facebook and won't operate as a standalone company. It already looks like its website and Twitter account have been taken down.

While waiting for his brisket to slow cook, he delivered an admonition to Elon Musk, his fellow Silicon Valley billionaire, and others who sound alarm bells over artificial intelligence posing a threat to our safety and well-being.
 AI is going to make our lives better in the future, and doomsday scenarios are ""pretty irresponsible,"" says Zuckerberg.
A user submitted a question, which Zuckerberg read out loud: ""I watched a recent interview with Elon Musk and his largest fear for future was AI. What are your thoughts on AI and how it could affect the world?""
 Earlier in July, Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, said that artificial intelligence will cause massive job disruption, that robots ""will be able to do everything better than us."" 
Musk also expressed dire concern over a future shared with robots: ""I have exposure to the most cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned by it,"" Musk said. ""AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.""

 });
 In the Facebook Live, Zuckerberg says he opposes the spread of fear surrounding the potential of artificial intelligence.
""I have pretty strong opinions on this. I am optimistic,"" says Zuckerberg. ""I think you can build things and the world gets better. But with AI especially, I am really optimistic.
""And I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios — I just, I don't understand it. It's really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible,"" he says.
""In the next five to 10 years, AI is going to deliver so many improvements in the quality of our lives,"" adds Zuckerberg. 
 ""With AI especially, I am really optimistic.""
-Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook
 Zuckerberg says artificial intelligence is already helping diagnose diseases, for example. He also points to self-driving cars as a way that artificial intelligence will improve our lives. ""One of the top causes of death for people is car accidents still and if you can eliminate that with AI, that is going to be just a dramatic improvement.""
Not that he's being Pollyanna.
""Whenever I hear people saying AI is going to hurt people in the future, I think yeah, you know, technology can generally always be used for good and bad, and you need to be careful about how you build it and you need to be careful about what you build and how it is going to be used,"" says Zuckerberg.
""But people who are arguing for slowing down the process of building AI, I just find that really questionable. I have a hard time wrapping my head around that,"" he says.

 Elon Musk issues yet another warning against runaway artificial intelligence

 Musk, who also advocates for proactive regulation around artificial intelligence technology, is not the only tech billionaire who is worried about what it will mean for humanity.
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates says that in the near future robots doing more work will be positive, but he does express concern about the potential of artificial intelligence in the long run.
""I am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence,"" Gates  says in a Reddit question-and-answer session.
""First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well,"" he says.
""A few decades after that though, the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.""

 Crypto investors flock to a market where tech giants Amazon, Google and Facebook are absent   
 2:38  PM ET Mon, 24 July 2017 |  00:47 
 Money is pouring into cryptocurrencies at a furious clip. You can call it a bubble, or the Wild West. Some say it's reminiscent of dot-com stocks in 1999, or ""tulip mania"" from nearly 400 years ago. 
 There's plenty of speculation, to be sure, and more risks than we can count.
But for entrepreneurs and tech investors, crypto and the underlying blockchain technology has a particularly attractive quality that's unique in today's tech landscape — it's about the only high-growth area not occupied by the industry giants.
 Think about all the buzzwords like cloud, robotics, internet of things, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. In each case, the names that come to mind are Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft.
Those five companies are worth a combined $3 trillion and have $530 billion in cash. They're big, getting bigger and building the computing platforms of the future.
For Chris Dixon, a partner at venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, their relative absence from crypto and blockchain is a welcome sight.
""A big challenge in the start-up world is that we live in an era of very powerful incumbents,"" Dixon said, in a recent interview with CNBC. 
 show chapters
 Ethereum's drop is making some say the Crypto-bubble is bursting   
 7:11  PM ET Tue, 11 July 2017 |  00:52 
 Dixon has led his firm's investments in Coinbase, a site for buying, selling and storing cryptocurrencies, and Keybase, a cryptographically protected chat service. Andreessen Horowitz also has backed Polychain Capital, a hedge fund that invests in digital currencies. 
In the second quarter, equity investments in blockchain start-ups jumped 44 percent to $232 million, according to CB Insights. The bigger boom is in initial coin offerings (ICOs), which are unregulated sales of digital coins or tokens that crypto projects are using as a new form of currency. More than $1.2 billion was raised through ICOs in the first half of 2017, according to Autonomous Research.
Not to confuse quantity with quality. Most of this stuff will surely go to zero, and eventually, the SEC will have plenty to say about it.
 `On the sidelines'
 But for now, there's a lot of wiggle room, as the tech leaders invest around the edges of blockchain while focusing their time and money elsewhere.
""I can't imagine they view any of what's happening right now as a competitive threat to their business,"" said Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), which invests in an array of blockchain companies, projects and currencies. ""They're not going to be a first mover. They're going to watch innovation happen, they're going to learn, sit on the sidelines and to the extent they see something that plugs in nicely to their business model, they'll acquire.""
It's important to differentiate between blockchain and crypto.
The blockchain is a distributed electronic ledger that allows all transactions such as payments, loans and contracts to be tracked in real time. Cryptocurrencies are an application of blockchain technology that take advantage of its decentralized nature to create alternative forms of money that aren't tied to central banks. Hundreds of crypto projects have created their own currencies.
While the tech giants are practically nonexistent in crypto, they're at least paying attention to blockchain and putting a little money to work.
Microsoft has a product in its Azure cloud called blockchain as a service, which essentially hosts blockchain start-ups and workloads. Amazon Web Services was working on a similar offering with DCG as of a year ago, according to a Forbes story, though no official announcement has been made. 
Most of Alphabet's activity in the market is through its venture arm GV, which has backed start-ups including Blockchain (the company) and Ripple, a distributed payments network used by banks. Google's AI unit DeepMind is using a blockchain-like ledger to track and protect medical data. 
Apple and Facebook, meanwhile, have been near silent on the subject.

 IBM CEO talks 'new collar' jobs in tech   
 9:11  PM ET Mon,  9 Jan 2017 |  04:35 
 The most vocal of the big vendors has been IBM, which said last month that it's building blockchain technology for seven of Europe's largest banks to facilitate international trade for small and medium-size enterprises. CEO Ginni Rometty said at a conference in January that IBM is using blockchain internally to track financing and is also working with large retailers and shippers, implementing blockchain throughout global logistics systems.
It's all early and there remain opportunities for upstarts to create new blockchain platforms.
Crypto projects are even less proven, as there haven't been any breakout use cases other than bitcoin as a store of value, albeit a quite volatile one.
Investors see a promising market where Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg aren't yet lurking. Josh Hannah, a partner at venture firm Matrix Partners, has been buying cryptocurrencies for his own accounts but isn't yet betting his firm's money on any projects or start-ups. 
He's waiting and watching.
""Most of this is much closer to the research end than we usually play,"" said Hannah, who previously helped create betting site Betfair. ""If crypto delivers on its promise, then it could be one of those platform disruptions, which would be great for entrepreneurs and VCs.""
That is, Hannah notes, ""unless this one disrupts VCs.""

 BALI, Indonesia — As an American who relocated to Singapore last year, I often tend to think my life has been disrupted heavily over the past decade by tech companies: Recent technologies allow me to connect with an old friend from years past or have nearly anything delivered to my door in a day or sometimes just hours.
But I recently witnessed how some of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies, from Uber to Facebook, are impacting professional and personal lives for some in far greater ways than myself. Specifically, on an island more than 8,300 miles from California's tech hub.

Bali, Indonesia
 I had just landed in Bali for a weekend trip from Singapore. The guy on the flight next to me was going for two weeks from Paris, making me instantly envious of France's comfortable vacation policy. He asked if I had researched how to get from the airport to the hotels. ""I'm just going to Uber,"" I replied.
Stunned, he asked me, ""You think they have Uber in Bali?""
If there's one thing I've learned during travels, it's that where there are cars and internet, there is usually Uber. I've used it in places from Cairo to Bogota. For North Korea, I assume it doesn't exist. And in Iran, perhaps not yet: The app was usable when I was there, but said ""No Cars Available"" when I opened the app.
While its availability is near-uniform, whether Uber is allowed by various local regulations is another story.
I ordered an Uber and two minutes later experienced something new: The driver wasn't calling me from a phone number to find my exact whereabouts, but rather through Facebook-owned WhatsApp. He added my number to his phone to find I also use the messaging platform. (I appreciated the move since it uses regular internet data as opposed to a mobile network's phone charges.)
After I entered the car, he offered me a bottled water — and later, candy. And then a wifi password. Before I could even ask, he offered me a phone charger  offering both Android and iPhone options.
I nervously wondered if I had chosen the default UberX option or accidentally clicked on an Uber Premium/Exec/Luxury/VIP/Pamper ride?
No, it turned out, it was just UberX.
""Is there Uber in Bali?"" I heard the French guy's voice in my head. If only he knew: He was probably still standing in the airport's taxi line.
Inside the car was a binder with photos showing a monkey on a tourist's shoulder, exotic waterfalls and people riding jet skis. All covered in a nicely, laminated book.
He asked me what my plans were for the next day, offering to be a tour guide and driver. The cost would be $35 for up to 8 hours.
His job as an Uber driver was just the beginning. An ideal ride for him was far less about a nominal fee and a 5-star rating. Rather, it was a chance to upsell a rider to a private tour in later days.
Before driving for Uber, my driver said, he worked in laundry services at a local hotel, but he made a lot more money now and gets to choose his own schedule.
And it's not just him. He told me he's part of a WhatsApp group with dozens of other drivers doing similar work. They're all using Uber to meet tourists, becoming their personal tour guide, and then getting paid directly in cash — of course.
He uses the WhatsApp conversation thread to share and converse with other drivers about best tips for their line or work and recently to share where there are police checkpoints. Bali recently officially banned Uber from the island, but it has had a challenging time enforcing the rules as drivers and passengers alike are still using the service.
At age 26, the driver had a wife (whom he met on Facebook), a 3-year-old daughter and another child on the way. He claimed he made more money than ever before, which made their lives better.
He also had the newest Samsung Galaxy, and his car was quite nice (remember, he was also offering high speed wifi from his vehicle).
The ride took about an hour and cost $6.

 A figure in Alphabet's earnings report may signal Facebook will beat the Street   
 11:41  AM ET Tue, 25 July 2017 |  00:46 
 Facebook shares fell in the premarket Tuesday after the earnings report for internet competitor Alphabet disappointed investors, who sent shares of the Google-parent down more than 3 percent.
 But Citi Research believes these investors are wrong and that actually a figure within the Alphabet's earnings report points to a better-than-expected result from Facebook when the social network reports after the bell Wednesday. 
Citigroup analyst Mark May's Tuesday note to clients points out that Facebook's advertising revenue was 93 percent correlated with Alphabet's ""core sites"" revenue over the last five quarters.
 Source: Citi Research
""GOOG's 2Q17 results imply upside to FB expectations in the quarter,"" May wrote.
Based on that correlation, Citigroup's model predicts a 51 percent year-over-year boost in advertising revenue in the second quarter for Facebook.
We ""view the checks on Google's core search business and Google's reported results as the most reliable indicator of Facebook's revenue trends,"" the analyst added.
So therefore May predicts Facebook earned $1.44 a share in the second quarter, which is way above Wall Street's consensus view. (Analysts are currently expecting EPS of $1.12, according to FactSet, but it's unclear if that figure is exactly comparable to Citi's estimate.)
Facebook's stock has been a leader in internet equities this year, up nearly 45 percent year to date. The social media giant has been propelled by reports of continued innovation and strong advertisement numbers as it looks to monetize its Messenger and WhatsApp platforms.
""We are encouraged by the company's continued strong pace of innovation and view these efforts as supporting our long-term forecasts and Buy rating. We continue to rank Facebook as our top pick,"" stated the report.
Citigroup's 12-month price target on Facebook is $190, representing 14 percent upside from Monday's close.

 Elon Musk: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's knowledge of A.I.'s future is 'limited'   
 9:38  AM ET Tue, 25 July 2017 |  01:00 
 Billionaire Elon Musk said Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's understanding of the future of artificial intelligence (AI) is ""limited"", as the spat between the two tech bosses continues. 
 On Sunday, Zuckerberg took to Facebook Live talking informally to viewers while at a barbecue. A user submitted a question saying how they had seen a recent interview with Musk in which he said his largest fear for the future was AI. 
Musk has been vocal about his fear of AI in the future. Earlier this month for example, he said that AI will cause massive job disruption and that robots ""will be able to do everything better than us."" The Tesla CEO has also advocated a policy of universal basic income to protect people from the fallout of AI disruption.
 Zuckerberg however, doesn't agree with Musk's view. During the Facebook Live, Zuckerberg called doomsday scenarios about AI ""pretty irresponsible"". 
""I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios — I just, I don't understand it. It's really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible,"" Zuckerberg said.
""In the next five to 10 years, AI is going to deliver so many improvements in the quality of our lives,"" added Zuckerberg.
A Twitter user posted an article about Zuckerberg's comments. Musk, responding to the tweet, said that he has already spoken to Zuckerberg about this and that the Facebook CEO's ""understanding of the subject is limited.""
 TWEET
 Another twitter user replied that he should write a blog post, to which Musk responded jokingly that a movie on the subject is ""coming soon"". 
It is an unusually public spat for the two technology CEOs, neither of which have competing businesses. But it highlights the level of debate happening in the technology community over the future of AI.
Musk has previously warned that humans will need to merge with machines or risk becoming irrelevant. And while the two might disagree on the impact AI has, Zuckerberg, like Musk, agrees with the idea of a universal basic income to help cushion any fallout from new technology.

Preisdent Donald Trump speaks during a meeting at the White House
 House Republicans are asking the chief executives of tech and telecom rivals — including Facebook, Google, AT&T and Comcast* — to appear before the U.S. Congress in September and help settle the debate over net neutrality once and for all.
At the moment, the Trump administration is preparing to scrap the U.S. government's existing rules, which prevent internet service providers from blocking or slowing down web traffic, or from charging companies like YouTube or Netflix for faster delivery of their content. The reason: The Federal Communications Commission under its GOP leader, Chairman Ajit Pai, believes they're too heavy handed.
But Pai's plans for repeal — a guaranteed outcome at the Republican-controlled FCC — mark only the latest round of fighting in a debate that's more than 15 years in the making. The constant legal wrangling has left all sides in agreement that  Congress should get involved and craft a law that says what internet providers can or can't do.
 To that end, Rep. Greg Walden, the Republican leader of the tech-focused House Energy and Commerce Committee, has asked the chief executives of top technology and telecommunications companies to testify before his panel at a newly announced, September 7 hearing focused on net neutrality, he said today.
Invitees include Alphabet CEO Larry Page, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, A&T CEO Brian Roberts, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, and the leaders of Amazon, Netflix, Charter and Verizon, according to the committee.
In a letter requesting their appearance, Walden said the open internet rules put in place during the Obama administration — which subject broadband providers to utility-like regulation — ""disrupted the longstanding regulatory balance that for years allowed the internet to grow and thrive.""
As Pai looks to repeal them, however, it gives both sides ""an opportunity to rethink the current regulatory model and build new rules from the ground up"" in Congress, Walden continued.
More from Recode: Rob Fishman used to connect young stars with advertisers. Now he's making videos with them at his new startup, Brat. Google is having trouble pushing its Facebook-like news feed to Android devices Twitter says it's punishing 10 times more users for being abusive than it was a year ago
""With your help, I know we can craft a fair, predictable and sustainable solution that not only benefits edge providers and internet service providers, but also the billions of consumers worldwide that deserve a free and open internet,"" he told chief executives in his letter requesting their help.
At the FCC, Pai's repeal effort marks the third time in recent years that the agency is at the drawing board over net neutrality, after the likes of Comcast and Verizon took the agency to court and blocked its earlier efforts to implement open internet rules.
That vicious cycle has left both sides of the debate pining for Congress, not the FCC, to broker a resolution on net neutrality, so that the government's approach to internet policy doesn't change depending on which party is in power — or who prevails in federal courtrooms.
Even net neutrality advocates in the tech sector -- and repeal-friendly telecom giants — share a reluctance to continue fighting over the issue in wonky FCC proceedings and lawsuits. Companies like AT&T and Verizon told the FCC in official comments earlier this month that Congress should set down the final limits on how they can manage their web traffic. So did Facebook's Zuckerberg, who signaled his  support for congressional action in a note posted during the July 12 online protest of Pai's plans.
Now, those very executives are being asked to come before the House and actually begin the process of legislating, no easy task for the tech and telecom industries, which have long called for Congress to take action — and long have failed to reach any compromise.
Others in Congress share a desire to pursue legislation: That includes Walden's counterpart in the Senate, John Thune,  who wrote in Recode earlier this month that a new net neutrality law is ""obvious and — no, I'm not kidding — within Congress's reach.""
But lawmakers so far have offered few specifics, and for the moment, they don't have much Democratic support. Many in the party have rallied to save the FCC's existing, utility-like rules, preferring the Obama administration's approach.
Others, like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, fear that any attempt to tackle net neutrality with Republicans in charge of the White House and Congress will result in rules that are too weak — and given internet providers too much power to tamper with internet traffic.
""As a guy right now that has listened to Donald Trump, who is the president, who has the power of the pen, I don't want to go to work on legislation that he is not going to approve because he has a very different philosophy than I do,""  Booker told Recode. ""I think we should have net neutrality. [Trump] is saying, let corporations be able to do the kind of things . . . all the kind of things [that] we, who believe in net neutrality, are fighting against.""
Walden, however, expressed a note of optimism. Announcing his plans during a hearing with Pai and the FCC's other commissioners, the leading GOP lawmaker highlighted ""consensus is forming across party lines and across industries that it's time for Congress to call a halt on the back-and-forth and set clear net neutrality ground rules for the internet.""
""With almost everyone in agreement about fundamental principles to prevent anti-competitive behavior such as throttling and blocking, I think we are closer than ever to achieving a lasting resolution,"" he said. ""The time has come to get everyone to the table and get this figured out.""

 Hundreds of Facebook cafeteria workers demand a raise   
 5:04  PM ET Tue, 25 July 2017 |  01:03 
 An individual wage near $20 an hour, or about $41,600 per year, could be the basis of a sustainable working-class life in many cities and regions of the U.S.
But not so in Silicon Valley, where many (non-entry) jobs at established technology companies pay in the low six figures per year or more.
 From San Francisco south to San Jose, anyone earning such an income would be hard-pressed to save enough for a down payment on a home or for a child's college education.
Faced with that daunting reality, 500 or so people who work at the cafeteria at Facebook's headquarters in the city of Menlo Park, California, this month voted to unionize.
Those who voted to join the union, Unite Here Local 19, in hopes of pushing up wages, included a couple named Nicole and Victor, who are living together with their three children in a garage not far from Facebook's campus, according to a report in the The Guardian.
Neither Facebook nor the food service contractor that runs the cafeteria, Flagship Facility Services, opposed the union drive, the report said.

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook
 Wall Street sees Facebook posting a higher quarterly profit when it releases financial results after the close of markets Wednesday, driven by surging sales of video and display ads.
 The company is expected to report second-quarter profit of $1.13 per share, based on the average estimate of 35 analysts who rate its stock.
That's up from 97 cents per share a year earlier, according to the estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters.
 Revenue is seen rising to $9.2 billion, a jump of 43 percent year-over-year.
If Facebook hits those numbers, its revenue growth for the period will be twice that of Alphabet unit Google, its larger rival and primary competitor in the market for online advertising.
Both are trying to rapidly add more video content to take advantage of an explosion in spending on video ads.
The market for digital video (not including traditional TV ads) is forecast to rise 19 percent this year to $11.7 billion, according to data from the research firm eMarketer, cited in a May report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau.
That's the same ad revenue growth rate Google had in the second quarter, based on the results Alphabet released Monday.
 Playing catch-up to YouTube
 While Alphabet has a head start thanks to its YouTube video service, which now has 1.5 billion monthly users and dozens of its own original shows, Facebook is racing to catch up.
The company now has 2 billion monthly users and is adding workers with job titles more familiar to Hollywood than Silicon Valley.
Facebook is also in talks with entertainment and media companies to produce its own original video content.
The company's video push has not been without challenges -- some of which could prove expensive.
Facebook said during the quarter it would add 3,000 workers to help keep violent and offensive material off its site.
That announcement came after leaders in Europe threatened to punish internet companies that allowed terrorists to use their services to plan attacks.
And Wall Street analysts have been lowering their full-year, 2017 earnings estimates for the company, expecting higher costs for producing video content and building more data centers.
Facebook has already alerted analysts that some expenses will grow faster than revenue:
""We continue to expect that full-year 2017 capital expenditures will be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, which is up over 50 percent compared to last year,"" CFO David Wehner said on the company's first-quarter earnings call in May.
 Instagram a new growth driver
 Facebook is also beginning to place ads on its other web properties, including Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram.
Facebook has been using Instagram to pummel smaller rival Snap, and the photo-sharing service CEO Mark Zuckerberg acquired for $1 billion in 2013 is expected to produce sales of $3.6 billion this year.
Facebook shares are up 41 percent this year, twice the gain of the broader market for tech shares, as measured by the Nasdaq Composite Index.

 });If you want a job at one of the world's most sought-after tech employers like Facebook, Google and Amazon, you better hit the books.
 Data analysis site  Paysa looked at over 8,200 job posting and over 70,000 resumes at tech ""titans"" (companies worth at least $100 billion with an IPO more than 10 years ago) and ""tech disruptors"" (companies worth at least $10 billion with an IPO within the last 10 years) to determine how long you need to stay in school in order to snag one of their coveted jobs.
Of these major tech companies, Paysa found that Snap Inc. employees are the most likely to have a master's degree — over 36 percent of jobs at the social media company require one. (For perspective, just 9.3 percent of Americans over the age of 25 have a masters degree.)
 Even though Snap Inc. is the most likely to require a master's degree, they employ people with significantly less work experience than other tech companies. Paysa's research found that Airbnb, Twitter and Uber employees were most likely to have six to 10 years of experience, but Snap Inc. employees were most likely to have less than two years of experience.

 Tech legend Roger McNamee loves Facebook as a stock, but the company has him worried   
 6:30  PM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 |  05:03 
 Facebook reported a much-higher quarterly profit, driven by surging sales of mobile video ads, as its advertising revenue grew at more than twice the rate of larger rival Google.
 The company also said on a conference call to discuss the results that 2017 expenses would rise less than previously forecast -- it's now saying that expenses will go up 40 to 45 percent, instead of 40 to 50 percent.
The stock jumped as much as 4 percent to a record high after Facebook announced that news.
 Here are the key second-quarter metrics:
 EPS: $1.32 vs. $1.13 expected, according to Thomson Reuters Revenue: $9.32 billion vs. $9.2 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters Mobile ad revenue: $8 billion vs. $7.68 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Monthly users (MAUs): 2.01 billion vs. 1.98 billion expected, according to StreetAccount Capital expenditures: $1.44 billion vs. $1.73 billion expected, according to StreetAccount 
Facebook has been adding more video and display ads to the mobile version of its app as more consumers access the internet via their smartphones. The company is expected to add short TV-like programming soon. 
""We are making some early investments to create episodic content,"" Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told CNBC in an interview.
The company has also overhauled its Instagram service over the past year to beat back a challenge from smaller rival Snap.
More than 15 million businesses now have a presence on Instagram, in addition to the 70 million who have Pages on Facebook, Sandberg said.
""Our goal is to be a platform for content creators,"" she said.
 Mobile ad sales top estimates
 Mobile ad sales now provide most of Facebook's revenue and hit $8 billion for the quarter, a jump of 53 percent and more than analysts expected. 
""As content consumption changes, online marketers are saying, 'I want to reach consumers wherever they are, whatever device they're using,"" said David Staas, president of NinthDecimal, which provides location data and other digital marketing tools to 250 ad agencies, brand advertisers and media companies.

 5:09  PM ET Wed, 26 July 2017 |  03:53 
 ""Facebook is well-positioned"" to take advantage of the trend, Staas told CNBC in a phone interview.
The market for digital video (not including traditional TV ads) is projected to rise 19 percent this year to $11.7 billion, according to data from the research firm eMarketer, cited in a May report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau.
Facebook's revenue growth rate is twice that of Alphabet unit Google, its larger rival in the online ad market, which earlier this week reported ad sales growth of 19 percent for the second quarter.
The average price of an ad rose 24 percent, Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said on a conference call with analysts after the results were released.
The number of ads rose 19 percent, Wehner said.
Capital expenditures were $1.44 billion, up 45 percent but less than expected, the company said in its report.
Facebook is building more data centers to handle the surge in video traffic on its websites and is also on a hiring spree.
The company now has 20,658 workers, up 43 percent from a year earlier.
""We remain very solidly in investment mode,"" Sandberg told CNBC.

 });Two of the biggest tech titans in Silicon Valley have been publicly debating the potential of artificial intelligence this week: Mark Zuckerberg is optimistic, while Elon Musk is fearful — and says that the CEO of Facebook doesn't understand the technology.
 Late Tuesday night, Zuckerberg defended his positivity, for the second time this week, in a Facebook post.
""One reason I'm so optimistic about AI is that improvements in basic research improve systems across so many different fields — from diagnosing diseases to keep us healthy, to improving self-driving cars to keep us safe, and from showing you better content in News Feed to delivering you more relevant search results,""  Zuckerberg writes.
 ""Every time we improve our AI methods, all of these systems get better. I'm excited about all the progress here and it's potential to make the world better.""
 On Sunday, while grilling brisket in his backyard in Palo Alto, Calif., Zuckerberg went live on Facebook and responded to a slew of commenters' questions.

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 One, which Zuckerberg read out loud, said: ""I watched a recent interview with Elon Musk and his largest fear for future was AI. What are your thoughts on AI and how it could affect the world?""
 Earlier this month, Musk delivered a scary message while speaking to the National Governors Association: ""I have exposure to the most cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned by it. AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.""
On Sunday, Zuckerberg was dismissive of such warnings. ""I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios — I just, I don't understand it. It's really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible,"" he says.
In response, on Tuesday, SpaceX and Tesla CEO Musk tweeted a rebuke: ""I've talked to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is limited.""
 TWEET
 In the same week that Zuckerberg and Musk spar over the potential for artificial intelligence, another billionaire tech titan, Mark Cuban, says AI ""scares the s--- out of me"" and, at the same time, Cuban says that Canada and China are handily beating the U.S. in their pace of developing artificial intelligence.
On the heels of Musk's dig at Zuckerberg, his post Tuesday night also announced that the Facebook AI Research team and researchers at Cornell and Tsinghua together won an award for their recent paper on ""Densely Connected Convolutional Networks.""

 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants the company to accelerate efforts to make money off its messaging products -- and on the company's Q2 earnings call, he shared a roadmap of how it can do it.
 ""We just started putting ads on Messenger,"" Zuckerberg told analysts on a conference call. ""I want to see us move even faster.""
As part of its long-term planning, Facebook plans to study what overseas rivals have done with their messaging products -- then improve upon those efforts.
 ""We can look at messaging platforms in other parts of the world and use that as a floor,"" Zuckerberg said. ""I think we can do better.""

 The process, according to Zuckerberg, will be the same one the company used to build up its business of selling ads in users' News Feeds.
First, build consumer usage, then build up interactions between users and businesses, then ""make sure it works,"" Zuckerberg said.
If the company executes on its plan, ads in Messenger can be one of the company's biggest growth drivers over the next few years, after its video ad products.
""We need to get to that place"" where the company is now with ads in its News Feed product, which helped drive second-quarter ad revenue up 47 percent from a year earlier.
Facebook said in April that Messenger had 1.2 billion users, up 20 percent from July, 2016.

 Cramer: Facebook's stock looks inexpensive   
 11:06  AM ET Thu, 27 July 2017 |  02:07 
 Facebook's co-founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, looks like he has the next five years planned out, and as a result shares of the social network are cheap, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.
 Facebook stock was up about 5 percent Thursday morning at around $175 per share, a day after the company reported quarterly earnings above Wall Street estimates, boosted by greater advertising revenue for its mobile app. Facebook has been adding more video and display ads to the mobile version of its service as more consumers access the internet via their smartphones. 
Cramer was specifically pleased with Zuckerberg's comments on the earnings conference call about placing ads on the Messenger app. ""We just started putting ads on Messenger,"" Zuckerberg, who is also Facebook's chairman, told analysts late Wednesday. ""I want to see us move even faster.""
 ""I am telling you Zuckerberg has the next five years planned out. This is an inexpensive stock,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street"" on Thursday.
If Facebook can push to monetize Messenger, it'll be key to moving its stock to ""the next level,"" Cramer added. ""[Zuckerberg's] ads are something you want to watch.""
Cramer also addressed Twitter's stock, which was getting slammed about 10 percent in early Thursday trading after the social media company reported a lower-than-expected 328 million monthly active users in the latest quarter.
However, Cramer defended the results, saying the daily average users were ""pretty good,"" adding revenue has been going down less and the company's programming is ""looking up.""
Twitter's latest quarterly earnings and revenue did exceed expectations.

But two of his employees tell The Guardian that they wonder when the billionaire is going to get to know his own community.
 The employees, a married couple named Nicole and Victor, are both contract workers in the cafeteria at Facebook's Menlo Park, Calif. headquarters. And they wish they, and the problems closer to home, could also get a share of Zuckerberg's attention.
""He should learn what's happening in this city,"" Nicole  tells The Guardian.
 The couple says they can barely make ends meet. Together with their three children, Nicole and Victor share a two-car garage adjacent to Victor's parents' home. They borrow money from friends and family to stay afloat and occasionally resort to payday loans.
Although they earn too much to qualify for state benefits, they don't earn enough to afford Facebook's health care plan.

 Here's how much you need to earn to be considered middle class in the biggest cities of the U.S.   
 11:14  AM ET Tue, 28 March 2017 |  00:52 
 Both parents earn well above the  $15 minimum wage Facebook established for all of its contractors back in 2015, The Guardian reports. Victor earns $17.85 an hour and Nicole $19.85.
Before taking jobs at Facebook, both Nicole and Victor earned $12 an hour as managers at Chipotle. But thanks to the rapidly increasing cost of living in the Bay Area, even the higher wages aren't enough.
Nicole and Victor's struggles are compounded by the fact that San Francisco has gotten so expensive even tech workers making six-figures struggle to make ends meet — or refuse to move there at all.
Some Facebook engineers reportedly asked Mark Zuckerberg for help paying rent while Twitter employees earning $160,000 can feel like they're barely scraping by. Even some residents making six-figures can qualify as ""low-income"" and receive housing subsidies.

 And Facebook has taken notice.
In June, the social media giant released plans to turn the 56-acre Menlo Science & Technology Park it bought in 2015 into a company town they're callingthe Willow Campus. The development will include 1,500 new housing units, 15 percent of which will be priced below the market rate. The village won't be comprised of only Facebook employees, either. Facebook will open up the units to the community at large,  Business Insider reports.
Google has similar plans to alleviate Silicon Valley's housing crisis. Google's parent company, Alphabet, is paying about $30 million to provide temporary, prefab housing for 300 of its employees.
 A rendering for Facebook's ""Willow Campus"" development in Menlo Park, California.
 According to  The Wall Street Journal, Alphabet is making a significant investment in modular housing built and shipped in from elsewhere by the start-up Factory OS, because the current local offerings are so overpriced: ""San Francisco rents have jumped by almost 50 percent since 2010, while home prices have increased 98 percent since the bottom of the market in 2009.""
Employees are taking steps themselves as well. On Friday, Nicole and Victor joined hundreds of Facebook cafeteria workers in unionizing in hopes of pressing for higher wages. 
""We're not asking for millions,"" Victor tells The Guardian. ""I just want to not be afraid if I need to go to the doctor. That's the reason we're uniting.""

 Wall Street is buzzing over Facebook's surging ad pricing growth. Analysts are stunned the social media giant is able to charge so much more for its inventory.
Facebook shares opened up 5.5 percent Thursday morning to a new all-time high.
 ""Shares are reacting positively to a strong pricing reflex that suggests the key pricing-driven 2H bull case is realistic,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Samuel Kemp wrote Wednesday. The internet company reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings Wednesday. Its ad pricing grew 24 percent year over year versus 14 percent in the first quarter and 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Kemp reaffirmed his overweight rating and raised his price target for Facebook to $195 from $170, representing 18 percent upside from Wednesday's close.
Facebook has been one of the best-performing large-cap stocks in the market. Its shares rallied 44 percent year to date through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's 11 percent return.  Goldman Sachs explained why Facebook was able to raise its prices. The strong pricing was ""driven by the ongoing shift towards mobile, increasing adoption of video, as well as Instagram,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini wrote Thursday. Facebook ""continues to be well-positioned in one of the best secular markets … we continue to see opportunities for incremental ad load on Instagram, increased engagement from Instagram stories, and (while early) potential for new monetization levers through Messenger and Whatsapp."" Bellini reiterated her buy rating and raised her price target for Facebook to $205 from $180.One Wall Street analyst also predicted Facebook's pricing power will continue to rise going forward. ""We believe Facebook's transition to video-centricity is helping drive incremental demand that can sustain pricing growth for the foreseeable future,"" KeyBanc Capital Markets' Andy Hargreaves wrote Wednesday. ""Further, we see significant opportunities to drive upside to estimates through long-form video and monetization of Facebook's billion-user messaging platforms."" Andy Hargreaves maintained his overweight rating and raised his price target for the internet company to $200 from $155.

David Wehner, Facebook CFO
 As measured by one key number, Facebook CFO David Wehner made Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat look like a profligate spender in the second quarter.
 Facebook's second quarter operating margin, or the percentage of revenue left after deducting expenses, was 47.2 percent.
That was far better than Alphabet's margin of 26.4 percent.
 (The Alphabet figure excludes the impact of the $2.74 billion European fine that was a big drag on its profit growth for the period.)
Wehner tightened down expenses even as Facebook generated revenue growth of 45 percent, more than twice Alphabet's rate of 21 percent.
That combination of surging sales and slowing expenses helped drive Facebook's shares to a record high Thursday.
Alphabet shares, on the other hand, fell the day after its report.
To some degree, the divergence is simply because Alphabet is five years older than Facebook, and books almost 3x as much revenue -- $26.01 billion, vs $9.32 billion for Facebook in Q2. Facebook is starting from a lower base, so doesn't have to spend as much to generate growth as Alphabet does.
But the favorable comparison is not set in stone and could even go negative for Facebook in the second half.
 Adam Jeffery | CNBC 
Ruth Porat, CFO of Alphabet, at the New York Economic Club on May 22, 2017.
 Wehner warned analysts on a conference call late Wednesday that the company's expenses would be higher later this year -- even as he lowered the full-year expense forecast range to 40 to 45 percent from 40 to 50 percent.
""I would note that we expect to accelerate our head count growth rate in the second half of the year, as we remain solidly in investment mode. We also expect that our video content investments will contribute to operating expense growth in the second half of 2017,"" Wehner said in his prepared remarks.
And by another financial metric, Porat did a better job than Wehner in the second quarter.
Operating expenses for Alphabet (again excluding the fine) rose 23 percent from a year earlier, while Facebook's jumped 33 percent.
That performance should help bolster Porat's reputation on Wall Street as the executive who is reining in spending on Google's more experimental businesses.
It also helps further explain what Porat meant when she said on her conference call with analysts late Monday that Alphabet was focused on dollar growth in revenue and operating income, rather than margins.
Since Porat joined Google (now Alphabet) on May 26, 2015, its shares have surged 76 percent, far more than the broader market for tech stocks, as measured by the Nasdaq Composite Index. By way of comparison, since Wehner took over as Facebook CFO in June 2014, Facebook shares are up 150 percent.

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook
 Facebook shares sit on the brink of entering a very exclusive club.
 The company's stock on Friday nudged up 1 percent, even as the broader market for tech stocks slipped, to set a new closing high of $172.45.
The shares rose for a second straight day after the company reported second-quarter sales, profit and user growth that topped Wall Street expectations late Wednesday.
 The stock move up pushed Facebook's valuation to $499.8 billion, or almost half-a-trillion dollars, after briefly touching that lofty level in intraday trading both Thursday and Friday. (According to Yahoo Finance.)
Combined with the drop in Amazon shares, the trading action left Facebook as the fourth-most valuable technology firm at week's end.
If Facebook rises to another high next week to close at or above a $500 billion valuation, it will join Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft as the only U.S. tech stocks to be so valued.

 });It may seem like Silicon Valley is populated entirely with celebrity college dropouts, but in fact, they're the exception to the rule. Going to college pays off, and to land a job at one of the most coveted tech employers, you'll need to stay in school.
 Data analysis site  Paysa looked at over 8,200 job posting and over 70,000 resumes at tech ""titans"" (companies worth at least $100 billion with an IPO more than 10 years ago) and ""tech disruptors"" (companies worth at least $10 billion with an IPO within the last 10 years) and found that employees at these companies are highly educated, not dropouts.
A disproportionate number of employees at these sought-after companies actually have advanced degrees, and one company stood out as employing the highest percentage of workers with Ph.D.s — Google.
 A whopping 16 percent of positions at Google require a doctorate degree. Less than 2 percent of Americans have earned a doctoral degree and an even smaller percentage have studied topics that are relevant to Google's work. Data visualization initiative Data USA reports that in 2015 there were only 34,002 people in the workforce with doctorate degrees in computer science — just 0.01 percent of the total U.S. population.
 Hero Images | Getty Images
 Snap Inc. employees are the most likely to have a master's degree — over 36 percent of jobs at the social media company require one. (For perspective, just 9.3 percent of Americans over the age of 25 have a masters degree.)

 With such a small percentage of Americans holding the degrees that companies like Google and Snap are looking for, many Silicon Valley CEOs are trying to make schools more like start-upsthat will train the workforce they'd like to hire. Marc Benioff, Reed Hastings and Mark Zuckerberg are all spending millions to shake up the American education system and increase computer science training in schools.

 An analyst at a small research firm is doubling down on his negative call for Facebook shares after the social media giant reported blowout earnings results last week.
 Pivotal Research lowered its rating on the internet company to sell from hold, saying it is facing digital ad saturation risk as large companies are ""scrutinizing"" their marketing budgets.  ""We think that the market is looking at upside potential without appropriately considering risks to growth,"" analyst Brian Wieser wrote in a note to clients Friday. ""With every passing year, digital advertising is closer to a point where the market is saturated."" Facebook has been one of the best-performing large-cap stocks in the market. Its shares rallied 49.9 percent year to date through Friday versus the S&P 500's 10.4 percent return.
Conditions around Facebook ""have gotten worse. You have political macro uncertainty. That's not good for them. You have increasing problems with view-ability that marketers were mostly not aware of at all last year,"" Wieser said on CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" Monday. View-ability refers to how many consumers actually read or view internet ads. ""I don't think most large marketers are aware of this,"" he added.  The analyst reaffirmed his year-end $140 price target for the company, representing 19 percent downside from Friday's close. Wieser reduced his rating on Facebook shares to a hold from buy on Feb. 1. Facebook shares have rallied 29.4 percent since his earlier downgrade.The analyst cited how large company advertisers represented 30 percent of Facebook's sales. He noted how P&G recently cut $140 million in its digital ad budget and said it had no impact on its revenue. P&G's ""statement will undoubtedly add fuel to the fire of large brands more carefully scrutinizing their digital advertising choices,"" he wrote. ""There are limits to growth to spending on advertising, as marketers are mostly unable to tap into broader and generally segregated marketing budgets."" Only one other Wall Street analyst out of 40 has a sell or underweight rating on Facebook, according to FactSet through Friday. Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Its stock price was down nearly 2 percent in midday trading Monday.

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
 Facebook on Monday said that it has acquired Ozlo, a start-up that built a virtual assistant app for Android and iOS. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.
 Ozlo launched last year, making its assistant available outside of other apps with assistants, including Alphabet's Google Allo, Facebook's Messenger, and Microsoft's Skype. Ozlo can give you recipes, point to nearby restaurants and show movie showtimes, among other things. But the app hasn't become extremely popular -- on Android the app has 500-1,000 installs.
Messenger's many end users can already talk with many chatbots in the app, and Facebook wants to get even more businesses using the technology to talk with customers. Facebook has also tested a dedicated first-party M assistant for a small group of users, and more recently it has made a few components of M available to everyone on Messenger.
 The majority of the Ozlo team -- 29 employees are listed on LinkedIn -- is joining Facebook, and they all will be working in Facebook's Messenger group, a Facebook spokeswoman told CNBC. The start-up's apps and other offerings ""are winding down,"" the spokeswoman said.

 Facebook reportedly working on voice speaker and video chat device with laptop-sized screen   
 9:58  AM ET Wed,  2 Aug 2017 |  00:50 
 Facebook is currently developing a ""video chat device"" designed for use in the home, according to a  new report from Bloomberg. The product, which could be announced next spring, includes a large touchscreen, wide-angle camera, microphones, and speakers. In concept, this sounds very similar to the Echo Show that Amazon recently released to build out its lineup of home-based hardware. It also lends added credibility to  a similar-sounding rumor that surfaced in July.
Facebook's video chat gadget is said to have a much larger screen than the Echo Show. One version in testing measures between 13 and 15 inches — the size of most laptops. The company is reportedly exploring the idea of running a version of Android on the device. Bloomberg also mentions that Facebook wants to use artificial intelligence for advanced camera features including one that would ""scan for people in its range and lock onto them.""
More from The Verge:
 Microsoft's new Xbox Wireless Adapter is no longer a massive USB stick  Mophie's latest USB-C battery pack is wrapped in fabric and designed to charge a MacBook  Microsoft is now selling Windows Mixed Reality developer headsets 
Several home cameras on the market already offer this type of functionality, including  the Nest Cam IQ, which can be set up to recognize and identify people in your home. But Facebook would likely face a more difficult uphill climb in overcoming privacy concerns and getting consumers comfortable with the idea of an always-on camera in their house. Many people are already convinced that Facebook secretly listens to them via their smartphone microphone, a conspiracy theory that  forced an official company response.
Aside from the video conferencing device, Bloomberg claims that Facebook is also at work on a standalone speaker ""in the low $100 range."" Both the video and audio-only products ""would run a Facebook-built voice assistant service"" according to the report. In his spare time, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been  creating an AI-powered assistant capable of controlling his own own home, and Facebook has also integrated assistant technology  within its Messenger service in an effort to add convenience for users. But the company hasn't yet made official any plans to directly challenge Amazon and Google in the home. Both hardware products are being developed by Facebook's experimental Building 8 lab, which is also rumored to be exploring  the idea of a modular smartphone.
Still, the pair of product rumors hint that Facebook is growing tired of sitting it out as voice-powered devices like the Echo and Google Home rise in popularity. Apple's HomePod speaker is scheduled for release later this year and would also beat Facebook to market if the spring timeframe — coinciding with the company's F8 conference — proves accurate.
The Oculus Rift might not be Facebook's only hardware product for much longer.

Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook's 2017 stock surge has Mark Zuckerberg keeping some much-older company.
 With Facebook shares up nearly 50 percent this year, the company's co-founder and CEO is now the world's fifth-richest person, thanks to a fortune worth roughly $70 billion.
That puts Zuckerberg, 33, between Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu, 77, and billionaire U.S. investor Warren Buffett, age 86, according to a list of the world's richest compiled by Forbes.
 And those aren't the only senior citizens whom Zuckerberg now calls peers.
The average age of the 10 wealthiest individuals is 72.7 years old, excluding Zuckerberg. Even including him, the average is still 68.7, or more than double his age.
He's the only member of the top 10 list below the age of 50. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is next closest at 53.
And among the 20 richest, he's the only member of the list below age 40.
Indeed, among those who have enough hair to judge, Zuckerberg is the only one of the world's 12 richest people not to have a head full of gray (Bezos' bald pate making his current color difficult to ascertain.)
As of March 31, 2017, Zuckerberg owned 410,758,857 Class B Facebook shares, or a whopping 77 percent of the total, according to page 37 of the company's annual proxy filing. 
At Monday's closing price of $169.25, those shares — which control most of the company's voting rights, and thus the company — are worth approximately $69.5 billion.
Zuckerberg then owned a much smaller number of Class A shares, now worth roughly $445 million, the filing says. (The company also has a third class of shares, Class C, that have no voting rights.)
Since then he has continued to sell off his holdings at regular intervals. In July, for example, Zuckerberg sold $42.5 million worth of Class A stock via more than a dozen transactions.

 Artificial intelligence researchers in recent days have been speaking out against media reports that dramatize AI research that Facebook conducted.
 An academic paper that Facebook published in June describes a normal scientific experiment in which researchers got two artificial agents to negotiate with each other in chat messages after being shown conversations of humans negotiating. The agents' improvement gradually performed through trial and error. 
But in the past week or so, some media outlets have published reports on the work that are alarmist in tone. ""Facebook shuts down robots after they invent their own language,"" London's Telegraph newspaper reported. ""'Robot intelligence is dangerous': Expert's warning after Facebook AI 'develop their own language,'"" as London's Sun tabloid put it. 
 At times some of the chatter between the agents did deviate from standard correct English. But that wasn't the point of the paper; the point was to make the agents effectively negotiate. The researchers finished their experiment, and indeed they noticed that the agents even figured out how to pretend to be interested in something they didn't actually want, ""only to later 'compromise' by conceding it,"" Mike Lewis, Denis Yarats, Yann Dauphin, Devi Parikh and Dhruv Batra of Facebook's Artificial Intelligence Research group wrote in the paper.
On Monday evening Batra weighed in on the situation in a Facebook post:
 While the idea of AI agents inventing their own language may sound alarming/unexpected to people outside the field, it is a well-established sub-field of AI, with publications dating back decades. Simply put, agents in environments attempting to solve a task will often find unintuitive ways to maximize reward. Analyzing the reward function and changing the parameters of an experiment is NOT the same as ""unplugging"" or ""shutting down AI."" If that were the case, every AI researcher has been ""shutting down AI"" every time they kill a job on a machine. 
Batra called certain media reports ""clickbaity and irresponsible."" What's more, the negotiating agents were never used in production; it was simply a research experiment.
Other researchers have been critical of the fear-mongering reports on social media in recent days.

 Researchers at Alphabet and Elon Musk-backed OpenAI are among those who have recently explored the field of agent-to-agent chat -- one of many areas where AI is being applied today -- and at times the agents have developed their own styles of communication, which researchers have been able to subsequently modify.
Notably Facebook released the underlying software and data set for its experiment alongside the academic paper. In other words, if Facebook were trying to do something in secret, this wasn't it.

15,2017-08-02,"Facebook on hiring more minorities: 'It's complicated'  The Facebook chatbot controversy highlights how paranoid people are about life with robots and A.I.  WhatsApp just offered another clue as to how it will finally start making money for Facebook  Forget about valuations, tech stocks are still on for a hell of a ride  Facebook reportedly working on voice speaker and video chat device with laptop-sized screen  ","David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images
A group of visitors sit for a photograph in front of the 'Like' logo displayed at the entrance of Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.
 Facebook revealed the latest numbers about the diversity of its workforce Wednesday, and even though the report reveals progress, minorities remain a small percentage of the company's global workforce.
 ""We aren't where we like to be, but we're encouraged that over the past year, representation for people from underrepresented groups at Facebook has increased,"" the company said in its blog post announcing its latest numbers.
Globally the number of women at Facebook has risen to 35 percent this year, up from 33 percent last year, and 31 percent in 2014.  points out how meaningful that change is given that its employee base grew 43 percent in the past year to more than 20,000.
 The percentage of women in Facebook's technical jobs has also risen 2 percentage points in the past year to 19 percent — and women now make up 27 percent of all new graduates hired in engineering. 
Maxine Williams, Facebook's global director of diversity, Williams points out how significant these numbers are in the context of the greater gender gaps in tech, where only 16 percent of computer science degrees go to women, according to the Computer Research Association. And now 28 percent of Facebook's leadership roles are held by women, up 1 percent in a year. And 55 percent of nontechnical roles are held by women, up from 53 percent from last year.
How does Facebook compare to others in tech? As of their most recent diversity reports Google's workforce is 31 percent female, Microsoft's is 25.8 percent female, Amazon is 39 percent female and Twitter is 37 percent female.
 More work to do on hiring minorities
 The pace of change is also accelerating for minorities at Facebook's U.S. operations.
The company has grown its representation of black people at the company by 50 percent, from 2 percent to 3 percent of the company — the first time since the company started reporting these numbers in 2014 that the percentage has moved. The number of Hispanics has grown by 25 percent, from 4 percent to 5 percent. Facebook also publishes LGBTQ numbers, with about 7 percent of its U.S. workforce self-identified as such.
So why are the numbers so low?
""It's complicated,"" said Williams. ""This is a reflection of a lot of societal issues that are not specific to tech."" She also cited how few women earn technical degrees and how much less minorities know about the potential to earn these degrees and work at a company like Facebook.
""There's the question of exposure of the tech industry to people who are traditionally underrepresented – the Bay Area is between 3 percent and 6 percent black.""
Facebook says it's investing in every stage of the pipeline to accelerate the pace of change, from recruiting to inclusion and retention.
""The more attention we bring to this, the more investment, and the more opportunities we provide, the better we'll get as a country at increasing these numbers,"" said Williams.

 });Oh how quickly fear metastasizes. 
 This week, a Facebook research project involving chatbots has become fodder for some dramatic headlines, many alluding to scary versions of what a future with advanced artificial intelligence may hold:
""Facebook AI creates its own language in creepy preview of our potential future""
 ""Creepy Facebook bots talked to each other in a secret language"" 
""Facebook engineers panic, pull plug on AI after bots develop their own language""

 });
 But many of the Facebook chatbot headlines actually mischaracterize what happened. According to a lead researcher on that AI bot project, Dhruv Batra, his Facebook and Twitter news feeds were ""blown up with articles describing apocalyptic doomsday scenarios."" 
""While the idea of AI agents inventing their own language may sound alarming/unexpected to people outside the field, it is a well-established sub-field of AI,"" Batra writes on his Facebook page, noting that research demonstrating this goes back ""decades."" 
 Batra also says the team stopped the bots because the experiment required the chatbots to speak English, not because there was something nefarious going on. 
Yet people are still worked up, some even paranoid about AI.
In fact, people are more afraid of ""computers replacing people in the workforce"" and ""technology [they] don't understand"" than they are about things like ghosts, blood and even their significant others cheating on them, according to the most recent Chapman University Survey of American Fears.

 That the conversation around a bot research project could so quickly spin out of control illustrates what a lightning rod artificial intelligence has become. 
Even tech titans of Silicon Valley are divided about a future integrated with AI. 
Elon Musk recently put forth his own doomsday scenario. ""I have exposure to the most cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned by it,"" says Musk, speaking to a roomful of governors last month.
""AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization in a way that car accidents, airplane crashes, faulty drugs or bad food were not — they were harmful to a set of individuals within society, of course, but they were not harmful to society as a whole,"" he says.
Batra's boss, Mark Zuckerberg, calls such fearful warnings ""irresponsible."" 
""I have pretty strong opinions on this. I am optimistic,"" says Zuckerberg. ""I think you can build things and the world gets better. But with AI especially, I am really optimistic. And I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios — I just, I don't understand it. It's really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.""

 WhatsApp is testing a new feature that could let users communicate with companies via secure messages, part of a broader overhaul to make the service more business friendly.
The tool will allow users to see whether a business account has been verified by WhatsApp before initiating a conversation. Currently, the feature, which has been downloaded by reporters at CNBC through the Google Play store, is in beta on Android and enables WhatsApp itself to communicate with users. 
 WhatsApp, which Facebook acquired in 2014, said in a blog post a year ago that it ""plans to test ways for people to communicate with businesses in the months ahead."" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last week that he wants the company's messaging products -- WhatsApp and Messenger -- to speed up their efforts to generate sales.
Zuckerberg needs diversified revenue streams as growth in Facebook's core ad business starts to slow. He told analysts on a conference call following second-quarter results that the company has to ""move even faster"" on its messaging products.
 Secure chat sessions via text, calls or video
 Facebook bought WhatsApp for $19 billion, nabbing a service with viral consumer usage but no established business model. Offering users and businesses secure, verified communication channels could be a key to realizing that value.
Eventually, this feature could allow verified businesses another way to provide customer support. And not just by text.
WhatsApp founder Jan Koum said last week its 1.3 billion monthly users share 1 billion videos per day, along with 55 billion messages.

FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) apps on a smartphone.
 Tech stock valuations were a big topic of discussion on CNBC last week which was full of earnings from the likes of Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon.
 Expectations were high ahead of the reports from the largest companies in the world, and investors got a mixed bag. Facebook had blowout numbers, Google parent Alphabet beat expectations but saw shares fall, while Amazon had a big miss on earnings, which saw its stock fall slightly.
For Alphabet, it seemed investors were concerned about the rising costs. For Amazon, investors appeared to be worried about the big earnings miss.
 But I'd argue investors weren't concerned at all actually.
Amazon shares fell 3 percent after hours. It was a similar move with Google even though the company beat on earnings per share and revenue. This move is really just investors taking stock, pausing for breath, and seeing a chance to take some profit. It's understandable when you look at the runs the stocks have had. Amazon is up 39 percent year-to-date, while Alphabet is around 20 percent higher. And it's not really surprising given the tech-heavy Nasdaq hit another record high last week.

 If investors were really disappointed, you would have something similar to Twitter, whose stock crashed over 14 percent on Thursday. This is a company which beat earnings expectations but failed to grow users. It hasn't been able to convince its investors that the growth will come in the future.
This is different to the larger giants: Netflix, Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Netflix is planning to spend $6 billion on content this year. Amazon's spending was up 28 percent alone in the second quarter, while Facebook said costs would rise as much as 45 percent in 2017. It's easy to think that these rising costs coupled with worries over the growth rates of some companies, like Facebook for example, should raise questions about valuations.
But as one investor told me last week, ""forget about valuations, just own the damn thing."" It's a mentality that is prevalent across tech investing. The majority of analysts have buy or strong buy recommendations on the large technology stocks and that's because these companies have convinced investors of their long-term prospects.
As investors, everyone knows that Amazon really doesn't care about the bottom line,"" Michael Yoshikami, founder of Destination Wealth Management, told CNBC after the e-commerce giant's earnings last week.

 ""What you're buying it for is top-line growth, revenue growth, market share."" This stands true for many of the largest tech stocks, which have in fairness seen strong revenue growth. With Facebook, you're buying into a promise of never ending revenue growth with a user base of 2 billion people and growing. With Alphabet, investors are hoping that its search dominance coupled with booming areas like cloud and YouTube provide a long-term runway. And with Amazon, well, no sector is out of bounds with this company.
In my last column from May, I made the point that there would be short-term wobbles in tech stocks, but ultimately the rally would continue. It has. And these giants of the world aren't slowing down.

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook
 WhatsApp has a long history of keeping advertising away from its users, and the co-founders of the messaging app once wrote a blog post that called ads disruptive and even insulting.
 Facebook, which bought WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, has a long history of placing ads on its most popular products and services, including the main News Feed, Instagram and, more recently, Messenger.
The first has helped WhatsApp reach 1.3 billion monthly users, while the second is expected to help Facebook get to $39 billion in revenue this year.
 Yet those competing strategies suggest an inevitable collision between WhatsApp's product vision and Mark Zuckerberg's revenue ambition.
 WhatsApp getting ready for business
 WhatsApp took the first steps toward becoming more business-friendly this week when it began testing a new feature that would let users communicate with businesses that have been ""verified"" as legitimate by WhatsApp.
The effort to connect WhatsApp users with businesses on the site is still in its testing phase, though, which means the messaging service has far to go before it starts generating any meaningful revenue.
It may not be able to get there fast enough to suit Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who expressed impatience on the matter on a conference call after the company's Q2 earnings report last week.
""I want to see us move faster"" on Messenger and WhatsApp, Zuckerberg said when talking about new sources of revenue. 
He also said, ""the first thing we need to do on Messenger and WhatsApp is get a lot of businesses using it organically.""
When Jan Koum and Brian Acton founded WhatsApp in 2009, it was never seen as a business app. Instead, WhatsApp has focused its software development on a simple user experience and secure messaging.
It made money by charging users 99 cents a year, while its founders developed a reputation as mavericks with their public disdain for an advertising-based business model.
In a June 2012 blog post, WhatsApp referred to advertising, among other things, as ""the disruption of aesthetics, the insults to your intelligence and the interruption of your train of thought...Remember, when advertising is involved you the user are the product...When people ask us why we charge for WhatsApp, we say 'Have you considered the alternative?'""
But one former Facebook executive questions how long WhatsApp can hold to its no-ads credo.
""If you look at the past, News Feed started as just friends, no ads,"" says Paul Adams, a former product manager and head of global brand design at Facebook who left the company in 2013. 
""Then Pages came along"" for businesses and ultimately ""you saw businesses placing sponsored posts (i.e., ads) -- in News Feed,"" says Adams, who's now a vice president of product at Intercom, a startup that provides messaging services to 20,000 businesses.
Adams says WhatsApp doesn't necessarily have to sell ads to generate revenue. 
Other huge messaging services have been making money in other ways.
China's WeChat, for example, charges companies that want to interact with its users a set-up fee and in some cases another fee for each interaction. It also takes a portion of some financial transactions users conduct on the site.
Zuckerberg himself hinted at this approach when he said last week:
""We can look at messaging platforms in other parts of the world and use that as a floor.""
 How long will Jan Koum carry the torch?
 The same day Zuckerberg expressed his desire for new sources of revenue -- July 26 -- Koum wrote a blog post announcing that WhatsApp had reached 1.3 billion monthly users.
In the post, Koum said WhatsApp was ""reinventing"" one of its first features, the ability for users to share photos and videos with friends via simple, secure status updates.
""Even your status updates are end-to-end encrypted,"" Koum wrote.
The post made no mention of any upcoming features for businesses.
Analyst Patrick Moorhead, from Moor Insights & Strategy, thinks WhatsApp will eventually capitulate on selling ads, but it might take a while.
""It will be the last thing they try,"" because it risks interfering with the user experience, he said.

Whatsapp CEO Jan Koum
 Koum was richly compensated for selling his company, and he's still on Facebook's board.
When Facebook completed the acquisition of WhatsApp in October 2014, Koum received 76.357 million shares of Facebook stock and $1.97 billion in cash, according to the company's regulatory filing that detailed the transaction. In addition, as compensation for remaining as WhatsApp CEO, Koum received 24.85 million Facebook restricted stock units, which vest over a four-year period.
But he's been selling large amounts of that Facebook stock at regular intervals. In the last 20 months, he's sold or given away shares worth more than $6.5 billion, according to regulatory filings. 
While such sales are a prudent way for a wealthy tech executive like Koum to diversify his financial holdings, they also mean he'll have less at stake if a showdown with Zuckerberg over WhatsApp's business model finally comes.
Facebook declined to comment on Koum's share sales.

 Google, Facebook dominate digital ad space: WWP CEO   
 7:11  AM ET Fri,  4 Aug 2017 |  03:22 
 Advertising mogul Martin Sorrell told CNBC on Friday his company plans to double its investment in Snap this year.
 ""But it's at very low levels. It's $200 million versus $6 billion or $2 billion for Facebook. So, you're talking about a flea on the elephant's backside,"" the CEO of WPP said in a wide-ranging interview on ""Squawk Box.""
""I think (Snap is) potentially more competitive as the third force,"" Sorrell added, saying he still likes Snap over Facebook.
 Last year, WPP spent about $100 million on Snap, and Sorrell said that could grow to $200 million this year. But WPP's spending on Facebook was about $1.7 billion last year and will be ""well over"" $2 billion this year, Sorrell said.
Snap shares were higher in premarket trading Friday but the stock hit a new all-time low Thursday amid a number of market jitters, including Facebook eating Snap's lunch. The stock is down 42.76 percent over the past three months, according to FactSet.
Snap's ""lockup"" period has also expired, allowing company insiders and early investors to unleash their shares into the market. The company is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report later this month.
Sorrell on Friday also spoke about social media companies fighting the rise extremist content. He said Facebook and Google are making significant steps but must be ""as vigilant as you possibly can."" Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Snap.

17,2017-08-07,"UK consumers will be able to force social media giants to delete embarrassing posts under new data law  Alphabet, Facebook and Twitter price targets hiked as analyst sees double-digit gains  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly hires Democratic pollster Joel Benenson  ","Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images
 British consumers will soon be able to request that their data is erased and force social media giants like Facebook to delete embarrassing posts under new data protection legislation.
 The law, which will enshrine the European Union's General Data Protection Rule (GDPR), is intended to give the public more control over what happens with their personal data – including the ""right to be forgotten.""
Plans to update the country's data protection laws were announced in a statement of intent on Monday. Digital Minister Matt Hancock said that the new law would support U.K. businesses and consumers alike.
 ""Our measures are designed to support businesses in their use of data, and give consumers the confidence that their data is protected and those who misuse it will be held to account,"" Hancock said in a statement on Monday.
 Data protection law to 'prepare Britain for Brexit'
 The digital minister added that the law would prepare the country's data protection rules for Britain's departure from the European Union.
""The new Data Protection Bill will give us one of the most robust, yet dynamic, set of data laws in the world. The Bill will give people more control over their data, require more consent for its use, and prepare Britain for Brexit,"" he said.
A legal expert told CNBC last month that U.K. businesses would still be forced to comply with the EU's data sharing rules.
""Brexit won't change how consumer data is handled in the U.K. - there won't be any reduction of rights or protection,"" Stewart Room, a legal expert on data protection at professional services firm PwC, told CNBC in July.

 'Trust is rotten' on data protection: EU's Reding   
 5:47  AM ET Fri, 24 Jan 2014 
 ""Data protection law has never before been so specific and directly prescriptive about what is expected of data controllers and processors. Organizations will be required to be much more transparent with consumers about what they're doing with their data, even before they collect it and if something goes wrong.""
The bill was first announced in July as part of the Queen's Speech, which opens parliament. It will move through U.K. parliament when lawmakers return from the summer break in September.
The EU's GDPR will come into effect as of May next year.
 Punishment for breaking data protection laws
 Firms that don't comply with the policy could face hefty fines. The new legislation would give the Information Commissioner's Office the power to fine companies that break the law up to £17 milllion ($22.2 million), or 4 percent of global turnover.
The current maximum fine companies can incur for breaching data protection laws is £500,000 ($652,500).
Proposals included in the bill would:
 Make it simpler to withdraw consent for the use of personal data Allow consumers to request for the deletion of their data Let parents and guardians give consent for their child's data to be shared Expand the definition of 'personal data' to include things like IP addresses and internet cookies (data which is stored when you browse the internet) 
The legislation would also create new criminal offences for organizations that ""either intentionally or recklessly"" allow users to be identified from encrypted data.
""We are pleased the government recognises the importance of data protection, its central role in increasing trust and confidence in the digital economy and the benefits the enhanced protections will bring to the public,"" Elizabeth Denham, information commissioner said in a statement.
The law allows consumers the right to force social media companies to remove information which they may have posted as a child.
Facebook told CNBC that it is already in compliance with EU data protection laws, and that it would be ready for the implementation of the new data sharing framework.

 MKM analyst Rob Sanderson hiked his price targets for three popular stocks, Alphabet, Facebook and Twitter, on Monday, forecasting double-digit gains over the next 12 months.
 Alphabet
 On Alphabet, Sanderson said the stock is a buy and is going to reach the $1,210 a share within 12 months based on a forecast for higher revenue.
 He said YouTube's contribution to the bottom line was probably unnaturally low last quarter due to advertising disruptions as large corporations voiced concerns over some of the videos where their ads were running.
The $1,210 price target is 28 percent above Alphabet's current price, at $945 a share.
MKM, however, said there are risks associated with this trade, including ""potential for further fines from the European Commission."" In June, the EU smacked a $2.7 billion fine on the internet search giant for antitrust practices.
 Facebook
 The analyst also said investors should buy Facebook. He hiked his 12-month price target to $200 from $180 a share — 18 percent higher than Facebook's opening price of $169 on Monday morning.
""Valuation has improved through the year as investor concern over a sharp second half growth deceleration has shifted to an expectation of a more manageable decline in growth rates,"" he said. MKM believes slower growth for advertising on Facebook is a reality but it ""will be manageable"" and offset by different pricing models.
 Twitter
 On Twitter, Sanderson kept his neutral rating but upped the price target from $16 a share to $18. In early trading Monday, the stock was at $16.38. ""The stock dynamic is becoming more interesting,"" the note to investors says. ""User engagement appears to be improving.""
MKM also said Twitter is too conservative in its guidance. Sanderson said there is a good chance the company will deliver earnings above estimates.

Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, hired a Democratic pollster and former top advisor to President Barack Obama as a consultant, according to a report from Politico. 
 The report, citing a person familiar with the matter, said Joel Benenson and his company, Benenson Strategy Group, will conduct research for the couple's philanthropy — the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. 
Hiring Benenson is the latest sign that Zuckerberg and Chan are pushing their philanthropic work more heavily into the political and policy world, according to Politico. The report pointed out that the couple previously hired Obama's 2008 presidential campaign manager David Plouffe and brought on Amy Dudley, who was a former communications advisor to Democratic senator Tim Kaine.
 Still, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC after the initial report that the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is working with Benenson Strategy Group on a single project, and that it does not have any long-term consulting contract with them.
There has been public speculation that Zuckerberg could be aiming to one day enter politics, or even run for U.S. president.
Most recently, Benenson was the chief strategist to Hillary Clinton's unsuccessful 2016 presidential campaign. 
""As a philanthropic organization focused on a number of substantive issues including science, education, housing and criminal justice reform, any research efforts we undertake is to support that work,"" a spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative told CNBC in response to a query about the implications of hiring Benenson as a consultant.

18,2017-08-08,"Billion-dollar neighborhood social network Nextdoor moves against Zillow, Redfin  ","After raising more than $200 million in venture funding and surpassing a $1 billion valuation, the social network Nextdoor is finally figuring out how to make money: real estate ads.
 The start-up, which was founded in 2010 as a way for neighbors to communicate online, launched a section on Tuesday that aims to connect real estate professionals with residents in a particular neighborhood.
Agents and brokers can create official business pages on Nextdoor to build their reputation as a local expert. They can also pay to sponsor a neighborhood section and buy branded listings so their Nextdoor profile shows up alongside their listings when someone searches for homes in the area.
 ""It's an opportunity for real estate agents to sponsor a dedicated section where they can connect and build relationships with neighbors,"" Nextdoor CEO Nirav Tolia said in an interview.
According to research from Borrell Associates, the real estate industry spent $26.8 billion on advertising last year in the U.S., making it one of the largest local advertising categories. Nextdoor sends postcards to people when they move into a new place, inviting them to set up a profile, and then links them in a semiprivate group of their neighbors.
The company has been called the ""anti-Facebook"" because it verifies users by address and connects people in their immediate vicinity. But the site has gained notoriety for allowing neighbors to stir up paranoia about crime on their streets. Last year, Nextdoor released tools to curb racial profiling within its groups.

 Nextdoor: Connect with neighbors online   
 9:45  AM ET Fri, 23 June 2017 |  03:25 
 The company has built a massive user base in the U.S. and has begun to expand to the U.K., the Netherlands and Germany. According to Tolia, Nextdoor is now used by homeowners in 80 percent of the U.S., and in hot real estate markets like the Bay Area, at least half of homeowners use the social network.
Revenue has remained elusive despite Nextdoor reaching a $1 billion valuation more than two years ago. The company said in a blog post in June that until this year the business has been funded by its investors including Benchmark, Greylock Partners, and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, but it recently started surfacing sponsored content from select businesses. 
""We have always believed that there is a tremendous opportunity to connect neighbors with businesses that serve the local community,"" the post said.
Even though it's not a listings engine or a marketplace, Nextdoor's new real estate section puts it in competition with sites like Zillow, Trulia (owned by Zillow) and Redfin. Its launch also follows Facebook's rollout of ad units for the real estate industry, which allow listings to appear in users' feeds on Facebook or Instagram.
""Our product is not an in-feed ad, and is not focused on listings,"" Tolia said.
Nextdoor didn't originally set out with the idea of serving the real estate industry, according to Tolia. Instead, the company observed which industries were creating profiles most on the site. Real estate offices claimed the most, followed by pet sitters.
Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly described how the company recognized interest from real estate professionals.

Mark Zuckerberg introduces a messenger platform at the F8 summit.
 The technology industry is infatuated with automated software programs powered by artificial intelligence.
 Alphabet's YouTube is using bots to recommend music videos, Amazon's are recommending online purchases and Facebook's are making it easier for businesses to communicate with users of its Messenger app.
The consulting firm Accenture even said in a report that the technology ""will double economic growth rates in 12 developed countries and boost labor productivity by up to 40 percent"" by the year 2035.
 There's just one problem: ""Bots are dumb and rudimentary,"" said Paul Adams, vice president of product at Intercom, a San Francisco-based start-up that sells bot-powered messaging services to businesses.
This week, Intercom is trying to do something about the shortcomings of such automated software.
On Wednesday, the company is unveiling what it calls Operator, an update to its bot operating system that Intercom claims can do what no other bot technology can: teach bots to be polite.
""Today's bots don't have manners,"" said Adams, a former product manager and head of global brand design at Facebook. ""They don't take 'no' for an answer, they keep spamming and are frustrating"" for their users, he said in a phone interview.
Today, Intercom bots handle simple, repeatable tasks such as collecting contact information, setting response time expectations and automatically answering questions by sharing relevant articles.
Operator will make sure Intercom's bots are more polite by enforcing the following rules:
 Don't interrupt when a customer is typing. Don't suggest articles if a customer has tried to self-serve. Don't spam customers or leads with more messages if they don't engage initially. Withdraw from a customer conversation after a human gets involved. 
The software will sit in the background of its various bot products for functions like sales, marketing and support.
The innovation comes 18 months after Microsoft was forced to end an experiment with a bot called ""Tay"" that was led into making racist statements by users, and just weeks after Facebook caused confusion with a paper about how it taught bots to negotiate — some reports concluded incorrectly that the researchers shut the experiment down because the bots were communicating in their own made-up language.
Founded in 2011, Intercom has 350 employees, 20,000 customers and has raised $116 million in funding, according to its website.

 Financial Times Op-Ed: Why Facebook should pay us a basic income   
 4:57  PM ET Wed,  9 Aug 2017 |  00:58 
 The idea of guaranteeing a basic income for everybody has many obvious flaws but one overwhelming virtue. It enshrines the principle that every citizen is a valued member of society and has a right to share in its collective wealth.
That conviction has animated radical thinkers for 500 years since the argument was first sketched out in Sir Thomas More's Utopia. The idea has gained renewed resonance in our own times as we fret about the erosion of living standards, the concentration of wealth and the possible threat of mass unemployment caused by technological change.
But for half a millennium universal basic income has remained little more than a utopian dream because it has always crashed up against the rocks of reality. The chief objections are ones of principle and practicality, encapsulated in two questions.  
 Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. 
Why should people be paid to do nothing? And how could we possibly afford it?
Yet it is possible to design a basic income scheme that retains its main attractions while minimising its flaws. By default, a good working model has been operating in Alaska for more than 30 years.
In 1976 Alaska's voters approved a constitutional amendment to create a permanent investment fund, financed by revenues from the state's incipient oil boom. A few years later, the Alaska Permanent Fund began paying out a dividend to every registered resident.
Depending on the fund's performance, the annual payout has ranged from $878 to $2,072 a head over the past decade. It is, in all but name, a universal basic income paid irrespective of social contribution or wealth.
The scheme has not led to mass indolence, as the critics of basic income fear. The clue lies in the adjective — basic. The scheme, which has commanded bipartisan support, has also proved increasingly popular and been described as the ""third rail"" of state politics because it electrocutes any politician who touches it. In a recent telephone survey, Alaskans described the fund's top three advantages as being its equality of treatment, its fairness of distribution and its assistance to struggling families. Some 58 per cent of respondents said they would even be prepared to pay more state taxes to preserve the fund, although Alaska has been knocked by lower oil prices.
In spite of its natural resources, Alaska does not rank among the richest of US states in terms of gross domestic product per head. Yet, partly as a result of its annual dividend, it is one of the most economically equal states and has one of the lowest poverty rates.
Last month, Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, visited Alaska and praised the state's social programmes saying they provided ""some good lessons for the rest of the country"".
Like other Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Mr. Zuckerberg believes that thousands of jobs are going to be swept away by new technologies, such as driverless cars. In such a world, he says, we need to invent a new social contract. Basic income could be part of the answer.
 ""His shareholders would hate the idea. But from Facebook's earliest years, Mr. Zuckerberg has said his purpose has been to make an impact rather than build a company.""
 Some argue that Alaska is a special case as it has just distributed the fruits of an oil bonanza. But it may be possible to find other sources of revenue to fund similar schemes elsewhere. Some have suggested a land value tax. Others have argued for a financial transactions tax.
But there is one other potential source of revenue that Mr. Zuckerberg knows all about: data. If, as the saying goes, data are the new oil then we may have found a 21st-century revenue stream. Data could do for the world what oil has done for Alaska.
Mr. Zuckerberg's concern for the marginalised in society is commendable, as is his commitment to building strong communities. Unlike most of the rest of us, he has the personal influence to help tackle the problems of our age. He runs one of the world's most valuable companies and has a ready-made digital pulpit from which he can make his case to Facebook's 2 billion global users.   He should now live up to his rhetoric and launch a Facebook Permanent Fund to cover a broader universal basic income experiment. He should encourage other data businesses, such as Google, to contribute too.
The most valuable asset that Facebook possesses is the data that its users, often unwittingly, hand over for free before they are in effect sold to advertisers. It seems only fair that Facebook makes a bigger social contribution for profiting from this massively valuable, collectively generated resource.
His shareholders would hate the idea. But from Facebook's earliest years, Mr. Zuckerberg has said his purpose has been to make an impact rather than build a company. Besides, such a philanthropic gesture might even prove to be the marketing coup of the century. Facebook users could continue to swap cat pictures knowing that every click was contributing to a greater social good.
Such a data-for-basic income swap is simple and clear. It should appeal to the solutionist mindset of Silicon Valley. Many tech entrepreneurs are suspicious of government intervention. But there is no rule to say that only governments can be in the wealth redistribution business. 
We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new things,"" Mr. Zuckerberg told Harvard graduates in his Commencement address in May.
Quite right, Mark. Give it a go.

 Facebook just announced a YouTube competitor called Watch   
 9:07  AM ET Thu, 10 Aug 2017 |  00:40 
 In a blog post on Wednesday, Facebook revealed that it will soon offer users a new way to watch videos on its social network called Watch.
 Facebook had been rumored to be getting into TV-like shows for months now, but Watch looks more like YouTube. It will let users discover videos outside of their own feed more easily, while also giving them a way to create Watchlists, and an easier means of following the videos made by a favorite artist, brand or publisher like those from Tastemade or Major League Baseball.
The feature will roll out to a limited number of users, and video creators, in the U.S. first. But Facebook did not disclose specific dates.
 According to a TechCrunch report, some users will have access to the Watch content and tab starting on Thursday this week. TechCrunch also reports that partners who make original videos exclusively for the social network will make 55% of ""ad break revenue"" via Watch, giving a 45% split to Facebook.
Following its last quarterly earnings update, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told CNBC in an interview, ""We are making some early investments to create episodic content.""

Sundar Pichai
 Google CEO Sundar Pichai faces an all-hands meeting on Thursday afternoon that could come to define his leadership of the Alphabet unit.
 Two years into his tenure in the top post and after 13 years of service at Google, Pichai must calm and unite a workforce divided over the firing of former engineer James Damore.
Damore lost his job of 3 1/2 years after criticizing the company's diversity-building efforts in a memo that also contained sexist comments.
 Pichai made the decision to fire Damore even while crediting him with raising important issues.
Damore's memo is so radioactive that it reportedly even divided the ranks of top executives who report directly to Pichai.
The fact that Pichai has elevated the discussion to a company-wide forum -- and has cut short a planned vacation to lead the meeting -- indicates how seriously he takes the decision to fire one worker out of tens of thousands.
That's especially the case because the CEO has a lot on his plate that has nothing to do with the diversity of the company's workforce:
 Facebook, its fiercest rival in the online ad market, just unveiled an online video service to take on YouTube. Google's cloud computing unit, despite making strides, still trails rivals Amazon and Microsoft in an important growth market. In Canada, the company lost a lawsuit in a ruling that could have major global impact on how the company collects and maintains information about its users. In Europe, regulators have already levied a $2.7 billion fine on the company over business practices they ruled were anti-competitive. Along with EU political leaders, they're also threatening tougher laws to punish internet companies that violate the privacy of EU citizens -- or don't do enough to protect them from terrorist propaganda. 
 Given the company's agenda, Pichai could have used a vacation.
But he didn't get the one he was expecting.
All-hands meetings at the company are usually brutally frank, Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in May.
Whether cutting short his time off -- along with that of other Google executives who were supposed to be on vacation this week -- turns out to be worth it will depend on how well he can unite the company's global workforce later today.

 Bucking the Street's worries about overvaluation   
 6:44  PM ET Thu, 10 Aug 2017 |  00:59 
 With analysts and strategists concerned that the stock market is overvalued as the Dow plunged 200 points on Thursday, Jim Cramer had to step in and add his voice to the largely bearish mix.
 ""Every few weeks some old-timer or hot hand comes on air and yells 'fire' in the theater,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""I get it. Look, these statements about the market being too high roll off the tongue so easily. ... The bears sure were right today, right? They could be right again tomorrow. But that doesn't mean they could be right over the intermediate term, which is the term that I like to think about.""
Cramer said that some fears, like those of the tensions between the United States and North Korea, are legitimate. But the slew of illegitimate worries about stocks being overvalued and on the verge of collapse need to be addressed, he said.
 First, Cramer acknowledged that some stocks are overvalued. Many of the big consumer products names sell at 20 times earnings, a costly price even for stocks with good dividends.
""But their dividends are often much higher than Treasurys and Treasurys give you no upside whatsoever, so what are you supposed to do? If you choose to hide in Treasurys while these stocks, I'm talking about Clorox, Procter & Gamble, frolicked higher, you've missed out a big run. Where I come from, you know what they call that? A mistake,"" Cramer said.
Some of the expanding technology sector is overvalued, too, but almost every facet of tech, whether it be biotech, semiconductors, or cloud, has taken a turn at being pricey, Cramer said.
Consider the trajectory of two of the four FANG stocks, Cramer's ubiquitous acronym for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet.
Two years ago, Facebook traded at $98 a share. One year ago, it was at $126. As of market close on August 10, 2017, the stock was priced at $167 a share.
Amazon's run was even more dramatic. The stock was said to be expensive in 2015 at $478 a share, in 2016 at $790 and now, at $956 as of Thursday's close.
""Hey, maybe 'expensive' doesn't mean 'sell, sell, sell,'"" Cramer said. ""The most disciplined thing you could've done with these stocks was to stay long through all the jeremiads by the graybeards to get out of them. You had to tune out the sirens of skepticism who said they were dangerous.""
And, to be frank, Cramer said he feels like an idiot having missed the monster runs of Apple, Amazon and others because his CNBC contract prevents him from investing in stocks.
The ""Mad Money"" host owns Treasurys instead, which might seem like a smart move to the bears, but has just made Cramer feel like he sat out on some of the market's greatest runs.
""I keep coming back to one major issue, even as I expect the market to go down [on Friday]. Almost every winning stock I've mentioned was overvalued, classically overvalued before its run,"" he said. 
Cramer recalled to when Apple, at $93 a share, was possibly the most overvalued stock of all time.
""I can show you analyst after analyst who told you that stock was going to get crushed because earnings were going to be down in 2017,"" he said. ""Oh yeah, that's right, the stock went to $160. But they were smart.""
So as Wall Street's serial worriers speak out about the market's ""dangerous"" areas and the forces threatening the bull, Cramer stressed the importance of choosing your own winners.
""Listen to yourself,"" he said. ""Do your own work. But understand that it takes a ton of discipline and conviction to own a Facebook or an Amazon or an Apple through these runs, and you aren't an idiot if you do. You're smart. In fact, I have one word for you: congratulations.""

 Two newly public tech companies reported earnings on Thursday, and both were ugly for their investors.
 Meal-kit preparer Blue Apron missed earnings expectations by a wide margin in its first earnings report since going public in late June. It reported a 47 cent per share loss instead of the expected 30 cent loss, blaming high customer acquisition costs and staffing a new distribution plant in New Jersey. 
The stock dropped 17 percent and is now trading at about half its IPO price.
 In its second earnings report as a public company, Snap disappointed Wall Street with its user growth numbers for the second consecutive time and fell short on earnings.
The stock dropped about 17 percent after hours. It's now off about 33 percent from its IPO price.
Blue Apron and Snap have a lot in common. They're consumer focused. They have devoted followers. They're losing money hand over fist.
And both were targeted directly and aggressively by two of tech's biggest companies.
Between the time Blue Apron filed for its intial public offering, on June 1, and when it went public, on June 28, Amazon announced that it was buying Whole Foods. The speculation that Amazon would use the purchase to improve its home delivery service sent demand for Blue Apron's IPO down, and the company slashed its IPO range from $15-$17 down to $10-$11.

 1:51  PM ET Thu, 10 Aug 2017 |  03:41 
 Then, reports emerged that Amazon had already launched a meal kit, which was on sale in Seattle.
In the case of Snap, it was Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg and company had been fighting to blunt Snap's growth ever since its co-founder, Evan Spiegel, rejected his buyout offer in 2013. It began to see progress with the launch of Instagram Stories in August 2016, which duplicated Snapchat's own Stories feature. Over the next year, it gradually copied nearly every major Snapchat feature in its own products.
Less than a year after launch, Instagram Stories has 250 million daily users and is growing at a rate of around 50 million every three months. Snap has 173 million and grew only 7 million during the quarter. 
The experiences of these companies are discouraging for start-up investors and founders who dream of someday creating an Amazon or Facebook of their own.
The five big tech companies — Alphabet (Google), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft — have attained unprecedented wealth and power, with trillions of dollars in combined market value and tens of billions of dollars in free cash flow. 
They also need to satisfy Wall Street's appetite for growth, which means they have to get new customers or earn more money from existing customers, quarter after quarter, year after year. One way to do that is to expand into new markets. 
 They'll gladly outspend their smaller competitors on product development and hiring while undercutting them on price.
That doesn't mean curtains for Blue Apron or Snap. Both companies could come up with a leapfrog innovation that catapults them (for a while). Young nimble companies overtake older and slower companies all the time — that's how the Big Five started. Microsoft disrupted IBM. Google and Apple disrupted Microsoft. And so on.
But companies and tech investors need to be wise about the risks of betting on upstarts that are going up against these giants.
If you hope to make money through online advertising, you'll be challenging Google and Facebook. If you're doing anything in e-commerce, logistics or delivery, you'll run into Amazon. In cloud computing, get ready to see Amazon, Microsoft and Google. If you're building hardware, Apple likely stands in the way. 
It might be better to focus on the niches that the Big Five don't yet dominate. Their health-care efforts are still in early stages, and none is playing heavily in financial tech, drones or robotics. Microsoft's power in enterprise software is blunted to some degree by other old giants like IBM, Oracle and SAP, plus newer players like Salesforce.
It's always been hard to build a successful start-up. With the increasing dominance of the Big Five, it's harder than ever.

Daniel Loeb, chief executive officer of Third Point LLC, speaks at the Skybridge Alternatives conference in Las Vegas, May 18, 2017.
 Activist hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, who has more than doubled the S&P 500's return over the last two decades, is finding himself in hot water outside the investing world.
 The hedge fund manager reportedly criticized a black New York state senator, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, on social media by referring to the Ku Klux Klan.
""Thank God for [New York state Sen.] Jeff Klein and those who stand for educational choice and support Charter funding that leads to economic mobility and opportunity for poor knack kids,"" Loeb wrote on Facebook in an apparent typo for black. ""Meanwhile hypocrites like Stewart-Cousins who pay fealty to powerful union thugs and bosses do more damage to people of color than anyone who has ever donned a hood.""After The New York Times reported on the comments, Loeb deleted the post Thursday night and sent a statement to the newspaper. ""I regret the language I used in expressing my passion for educational choice,"" Loeb said. ""I apologize to Senator Stewart-Cousins and anyone I offended. I have taken down the post from Facebook.""The investor is one of the few big-name hedge managers outperforming the market this year. He explained last week it was partly due to luck.Loeb's firm Third Point had $18 billion of assets under management as of late June. Loeb declined to comment to CNBC.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, center, talks with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, right, as Lu Wei, left, China's Internet czar, looks on during a gathering of CEOs and other executives at Microsoft's main campus in Redmond, Wash.
 Facebook and many of its apps have been blocked in China for years. To change that, Mark Zuckerberg has made a big point of meeting with Chinese politicians, reading stodgy Communist Party propaganda, studying Mandarin and — perhaps more daunting — speaking it in public.
Now the social network is trying a different way into China: by authorizing the release of a new app there that does not carry the Facebook name.
Facebook approved the May debut of a photo-sharing app, called Colorful Balloons, in China, according to a person with knowledge of the company's plans, who declined to be named because the information is politically sensitive. The app, which has not previously been reported, shares the look, function and feel of Facebook's Moments app. It was released through a separate local company and without any hint that the social network is affiliated with it.

The stealthy and anonymous release of an app by a major foreign technology company in China is unprecedented. It shows the desperation — and frustration — of global tech companies as they try to break into the world's largest online market. It also underscores the lengths they are willing to go, and their increasing acceptance of the idea that standards for operating in China are different from elsewhere.
China's internet censorship has left big players like Facebook and Google on the sidelines of a major boom there. The country boasts an audience of more than 700 million internet users who buy $750 billion of stuff online a year, but they are served by local tech companies that have developed their own way of doing business that can seem exotic to Silicon Valley.
Facebook hopes it can learn and potentially assimilate those ways. Yet the social network was banned in China in 2009, followed by its photo-sharing app Instagram in 2014, and its messaging app WhatsApp was partially blocked last month. While the company has more than two billion users around the world, Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, has often asked where its next billion users will come from.
Now Colorful Balloons gives the Silicon Valley company a way to see how Chinese users digitally share information with their friends or interact with their favorite social media platforms.
""We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,"" Facebook said in a statement.

 Facebook announces new platform called 'Watch'   
 4:06  PM ET Thu, 10 Aug 2017 |  01:37 
 It is unclear whether China's various internet regulators were aware of the app's existence. The under-the-table approach could cause Facebook new difficulties with a Chinese government that has maintained strict oversight and control over foreign tech companies.
""It's not a mere business thing,"" said Teng Bingsheng, a professor of strategic management at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. ""It's politics.""
The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a faxed request for comment.
Before the release of Colorful Balloons, Facebook had taken an unusually high-profile approach to courting China.
Mr. Zuckerberg had paid a series of visits to the country in recent years and become something of a celebrity there. Videos of him speaking Mandarin have gone viral, as did a photo of him jogging on a dangerously smoggy day through Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
Colorful Balloons represents the opposite approach — one that is low profile.
The app was released in China by a company called Youge Internet Technology, according to a post in Apple's app store. It is registered to an address in eastern Beijing, yet the room number listed in company registration documents could not be found amid a series of shabby, small offices on the building's fourth floor.
According to the documents, Youge's executive director is a woman named Zhang Jingmei. She appeared in a photo of a recent meeting between Facebook and the Shanghai government, sitting next to Wang-Li Moser, a Facebook executive whose responsibilities include building up the company's relationship with the Chinese government. Ms. Zhang's presence at such a high-level meeting indicated she is likely a Facebook adviser or employee.
Facebook declined to comment on Ms. Zhang's relationship to the company, and Ms. Zhang did not respond to phone calls requesting comment.
If Facebook did little to promote Colorful Balloons in China, it did work to tailor the app to a local audience. In the rest of the world, the company's Moments app connects users through Facebook. Colorful Balloons instead links users through China's biggest social network, WeChat.
The app, which is designed to collate photos from a smartphone's photo albums and then share them, does so in China with the use of a QR code, a sort of bar code that is widely used by WeChat and other apps in the country.
While photos can be shared, Facebook appears to have taken steps to ensure the app could not spread widely. For example, people who post photos from Colorful Balloons on WeChat will see a link that lets other users download Facebook's Chinese app. But the link does not work, meaning people have to seek out Colorful Balloons in an app store instead of grabbing it from their friends, which may limit its distribution.
The risk Facebook is taking with the new app is high. The company appears to have handed over a fully functioning product to Youge for release, and has done so without indicating in any public way that it is connected to Facebook. Coming just ahead of a key meeting of the Chinese Communist Party this autumn, the secretive release of Colorful Balloons could also undermine trust between the company and the Chinese government.
Such tactics underline the degree to which Facebook is willing to experiment and break precedent to get into China. Last year, The New York Times reported Facebook had also quietly been at work on a censorship tool that could be used on a version of the social network in a place like China, where the government demands control over what is shared. The tool could suppress posts from appearing in people's news feeds in specific geographic areas.
Yet even if Facebook is able to use Colorful Balloons to keep up with the Chinese market, a recent intense internet crackdown in China suggests the political winds may not soon blow in favor of the company further entering the country.
Mr. Zuckerberg's attention to China also appears to have waned. And China's former internet czar, Lu Wei, who had visited Facebook's offices in 2014, has been removed from his position, making things harder for the company.
""The government's control and surveillance of media is strict, and it is almost impossible for them to open that door,"" said Mr. Teng, the Cheung Kong professor. ""Although Mark Zuckerberg has visited China many times and practiced his Chinese very hard, I don't foresee any major breakthroughs for Facebook.""

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
 Facebook's mini-network initiative is part of the company's aggressive push into video. 
 The Watch video platform, announced Wednesday, is Facebook's new home for episodic shows and live events. Publishers include Group Nine Media, Hearst, Condé Nast Entertainment, Refinery 29 and NASA, with more companies to be announced. CNBC spoke to several media companies who have signed deals to produce at least one paid Facebook Watch show. Here's what the company was telling them about Watch, and what viewers can expect.
Facebook paid to have first-rights to series
 Two companies said they were paid between $10,000 to $25,000 per episode for their shows. They'll also receive 55 percent of the ad revenue while Facebook takes the rest. 
In a move that could be seen as a direct competitive move to YouTube, paid series have to debut episodes on Facebook, according to the publishers. However, they are allowed to move episodes off-platform to their own owned-and-operated players or YouTube after a certain period of time. Though Facebook was encouraging publishers to use their player off-site, the goal is to get as many people watching Facebook shows on Facebook itself, multiple sources said.
If Facebook succeeds in getting more people to watch its original series on its platform, it could help the company solve a major issue they are facing: Having too many ads. The company has acknowledged its NewsFeed is growing overstuffed with ads. If people watch shows, they'll be spending more time on Facebook. That would allow the company to charge more for ads because users are more engaged, without having to increase the number of ads on the platform. 
Compelling shows could also encourage more people to use Facebook, especially in light of reports teen use is declining as more users migrate to Snapchat.
Facebook is looking for something resembling traditional TV
All the media companies CNBC spoke to said Facebook is looking for traditional shows, where producers could submit episodes ahead of time. Each show will get a dedicated show page where old episodes will be kept. Facebook had a range of topics of shows they wanted, and came to specific media companies specialized in those niches to fill their order, according to some publishers. 
There were no restrictions on episode length, with the requirement being the shows lasted between two and 240 minutes an episode, one source said. Most producers are making shows within the 5 to 10 minute range. How Watch shows are different from videos that are already on Facebook
Many companies already produce original videos for Facebook. But while you may happen on these short clips while scrolling through your NewsFeed, Watch shows are meant to be tuned into regularly. The Watch platform itself is more curated, with editors deciding which content to feature rather than recommendations just based off user likes and dislikes.
Quartz, for example, will be producing three documentary-style shows for Watch with two expected to roll out later this month. ""Machines with Brains"" looks at what it means to be human in an age of artificial intelligence and robots, while ""Because Science"" will be a narrative explainer that mixes animation and live footage. Another series will tackle exploration.
""The main goal is not something that will catch their eye as they are scrolling through their feed, but create things people will watch,"" said Quartz executive producer Solana Pyne.
Watch shows aren't likely meant to compete against Netflix or Snapchat; their typical length and style suggests instead the company wants to compete with YouTube. 
Media companies have come to rely on YouTube as the primary means of reaching an audience -- but if Facebook is paying them, they're more open to using it first.
The two platforms can potentially coexist. One source said YouTube was a better home for its existing community, where Facebook's NewsFeed could help them connect with a new audience. 
There's one more glaring question: Are audiences willing to watch lengthier content on Facebook as opposed to YouTube, where people are used to watching longer videos? Facebook may have been quietly training its users to watch longer videos to prepare for the change. One producer noticed Facebook's algorithm began favoring videos over two minutes as opposed to shorter clips about five months ago.
Facebook said it ranks content based on how relevant it is to the user, which can include factors like how long a user watches a video, how many they watch to the end, and whether or not they watch with sound.

And though it's unclear that he will make a bid for to be the next U.S. President in 2020, he could certainly afford it.
 The clues
 According to Politico, some of the signs that he does plan to run are there.
Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan have hired Joel Benenson, a Democratic pollster, adviser to former President Barack Obama and chief strategist of Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, as a consultant for their joint philanthropic project, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
 The pair also hired David Plouffe, campaign manager for Obama's 2008 presidential run; Amy Dudley, former communications adviser for Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.;  and Ken Mehlman, who directed President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign.
Zuckerberg is on a yearlong ""listening tour,"" where he is traveling to all 50 states and meeting with leaders and constituents in each — and, to document the trip, he has hired Charles Ommanney, a photographer for both the Bush and Obama presidential campaigns.

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive officer of Facebook Inc., speaks during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 2016 CEO Summit in Lima, Peru, on Saturday, Nov. 19, 2016. APEC aims to create greater prosperity for the people of the Asia-Pacific by promoting balanced, inclusive, sustainable, innovative and secure growth and by accelerating regional economic integration.
 The denials
 Zuckerberg denies that he has presidential aspirations. He wrote in a May 21 Facebook post, ""Some of you have asked if this challenge means I'm running for public office. I'm not."" He said the same thing to BuzzFeed News in January.
But it sure looks like he might be. And he wouldn't be the first politician to try to mislead the public.
 The costs
 If he does run, it would cost only about one percent of his net worth to match the amount spent on Hillary Clinton's presidential bid of 2016, which some predicted at the time would be the most expensive ever.
Overall, the bill for last year's presidential and congressional elections came to a record $6.5 billion,  according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The presidential race alone cost $2.4 billion. Of that, Clinton's campaign spent $768 million and Donald Trump's spent $398 million.
Zuckerberg's net worth, made mostly through Facebook, is $71 billion as of Aug. 14, according to Forbes. That makes him one of the richest people in the world.
It's hard to know exactly how much a presidential campaign could cost Zuckerberg. That would depend on how much he would shell out himself and how much he could collect from super PAC contributions and donations from supporters, as well as the price of advertising, travel, housing and staffing. However, the 2016 race could provide a template.
Deadlines vary by state on when a presidential candidate must declare their candidacy, but there are 1,175 days until ballots are cast in 2020, and according to CNBC calculations, Zuckerberg, so far, has made $4.4 million for every day he's been alive.

 The issues
 He hasn't revealed any kind of political platform, but the CEO has spoken in favor of a universal basic income.
The idea, whichZuckerberg discussed in Alaska during his listening tour, would guarantee citizens a set income regardless of age, class, job status and other criteria.
Supporters of the idea, like Elon Musk, say a basic income could be especially necessary as automation could replace lower-skilled jobs. Critics, however, say it does not address larger economic issues and, regardless, would be impossible to institute on a grand scale.
Zuckerberg also raised the idea during his May 25 Harvard commencement speech. ""We should have a society that measures progress not just by economic metrics like [gross domestic product], but by how many of us have a role we find meaningful,"" Zuckerberg told graduates. ""We should explore ideas like universal basic income to give everyone a cushion to try new things.""

 Snap shares have tumbled since its March initial public offering. One Wall Street firm believes there will be no turnaround for the social media company's stock anytime soon.SunTrust Robinson Humphrey on Tuesday initiated coverage of Snap shares with a sell rating, citing the competitive threat of its larger rivals copying its innovations.
 Snap's ""challenges around bringing advertisers onto the platform at scale, and getting a sizable portion of their ad spend short term are likely to take time to overcome, causing the stock to underperform,"" analyst Youssef Squali wrote in a note to clients. ""We also note a massive lock-up expiration of shares in the last two weeks, intense competition from Instagram/Facebook for users and advertisers.""Squali started his price target for Snap at $10, representing 22 percent downside from Tuesday's close. Despite the call, Snap shares rose 1.7 percent in early trading Wednesday. The stock bounced off its all-time low set Monday as some on Wall Street speculated the worst is over. The analyst cited how Facebook has added Snap-like features to many of its properties such as Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Facebook site itself. He noted 200 million people already use Instagram Stories, which is now larger than Snapchat's user base. ""Facebook/Instagram and YouTube are quick followers, constantly improving their value proposition as well, at materially greater scale,"" he wrote.
Snap's share price is down 57 percent from its high, reached days after the company went public on March 2. It is also down 25 percent from the $17 IPO price. The stock has fallen significantly from its high on weaker-than-expected second-quarter earnings, big insider selling lockups, increasing competition from Facebook and big-name hedge funds dumping the stock.  Nearly 70 percent of Wall Street does not have buy ratings on Snap shares, according to FactSet. Such a mixed view after a large technology IPO is a rarity.
 Snap did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Speculation is mounting that Mark Zuckerberg is running for president — here's how much it would cost him to run   
 1:48  PM ET Tue, 15 Aug 2017 |  00:56 
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence on Wednesday after a white supremacy rally in Virginia over the weekend that resulted in one death. 
 Zuckerberg said that while the process might not be perfect, the social media company is actively monitoring for threatening posts celebrating terrorism after the rally in Charlottesville.  He also noted that the public discourse today lacks depth — at a time when Facebook is being accused of creating echo chambers of discussions.
His comments come a day after a raucous press conference, where President Donald Trump was pressed to condemn the white supremacists more firmly. 
 ""The last few days have been hard to process,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""I know a lot of us have been asking where this hate comes from. As a Jew, it's something I've wondered much of my life. It's a disgrace that we still need to say that neo-Nazis and white supremacists are wrong — as if this is somehow not obvious. My thoughts are with the victims of hate around the world, and everyone who has the courage to stand up to it every day."" 
Zuckerberg echoed the words of former president Barack Obama, who broke records on social media with a Nelson Mandela quote that ""people must learn to hate.""

 An online group formed to discuss internal Facebook issues morphed into a pro-Trump forum that attracted hundreds of company workers before CEO Mark Zuckerberg shut it down, according to a report in Business Insider.
 The anonymous group, called Facebook Anon, gave Facebook employees the chance to candidly complain about the company's policies and culture, the report says.
At the start, it was used to talk about mundane issues, like the ethics of taking home extra food from the company cafeteria.
 Yet the tone of the discussions became increasingly political and heated as the 2016 presidential campaign season went on, as right-leaning Facebook employees began to see the group as a safe haven. Facebook pulled the plug on the group in December, shortly after Trump was elected president.
Later, at an all-hands meeting in early 2017, Zuckerberg reportedly said the group was shut down because it had been used to harass fellow workers.
An email to Facebook seeking comment wasn't immediately returned.
Shortly after Zuckerberg's explanation, a poster was reportedly seen on the Facebook campus with the group's beginning and end dates and the words: ""Silenced, but not silent.""

 });In the wake of the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally, which left an activist dead and many injured, some leading tech companies are taking a stand against extremist views.
 Last week Friday, right-wing blogger Jason Kessler organized a rally to protest Charlottesville's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a city park.
The rally ended in violence as supporters and counter-protesters chanted and threw punches and newspaper stands, according to the Associated Press.
 In the midst of the weekend brawl,  female activist Heather Heyer was killed when a car plowed into a crowd of people protesting the white nationalist rally. Far right websites have since come out supporting this act of domestic terrorism.
Here's how GoDaddy, Google, Paypal, Reddit, Twitter and Facebook have responded:

 });
 GoDaddy
 The domain name provider severed ties with the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer after the site verbally attacked Heyer. A recent post from the site mocked the deceased 32-year-old, calling her ""fat"" and ""childless."" It added that ""most people are glad she is dead, as she is the definition of uselessness.""
GoDaddy tweeted on Sunday that it had given The Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain because the site had violated the company's terms of service.
 TWEET
 In an interview with CNBC, the company's CEO Blake Irving said that the Daily Stormer crossed the line from exercising freedom of speech to provoking further mayhem.
""We always have to ride the fence on making sure we are protecting a free and open internet,"" says Irving. ""But when the line gets crossed and that speech starts to incite violence, then we have a responsibility to take that down.""
 Google
 The Daily Stormer moved its domain registration to Google after hosting firm GoDaddy cut ties with the site.
Customers can transfer domains to Google through an automated, online process that takes up to 20 minutes, according to the Internet company's domain registration site.
But shortly after making the transition, Google promptly canceled the registration for the white supremacist website.
""We are cancelling Daily Stormer's registration with Google Domains for violating our terms of service,"" the company representative said in a statement to CNBC.

 In June, the company released a blog post in which it denounced the use of Google platforms for terrorist activity. ""There should be no place for terrorist content on our service,"" said Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel of Google.
He added: ""While we and others have worked for years to identify and remove content that violates our policies the uncomfortable truth is that we, as an industry, must acknowledge that more needs to be done. Now.""
 Paypal
 The online payment platform vowed to pull its services from sites linked to hate, violence and intolerance, after reflecting on the tragic events in Charlottesville.
Paypal had previously been accused of playing a prominent role in raising money for the deadly white supremacist rally.
""We've been working directly with PayPal for months to cut off a number of hate groups that they allowed for years to generate revenue using their platform,"" says Rashad Robinson, the executive director of Color Of Change, the nation's largest online racial justice organization, in a statement to CNBC.
 Source: CNBC 
 In a lengthy post published on Tuesday, PayPal says that it has a longstanding acceptable use policy and that the company strives to navigate the balance between freedom of expression and the closing of sites that advocate intolerant views.
""Regardless of the individual or organization in question, we work to ensure that our services are not used to accept payments or donations for activities that promote hate, violence or racial intolerance,"" said the post.
""This includes organizations that advocate racist views, such as the KKK, white supremacist groups or Nazi groups.""
 Reddit
 The social news aggregation site  confirmed to CNET that it will ban pages and groups linked to far-right extremists.
Reddit's action was reportedly prompted by a subreddit, which was flagged for making inflammatory remarks and threats. The thread included calls for a return to segregation and expressed hopes that someone would ""bomb CNN and kill people.""
 TWEET
 Reddit users quickly  called on the website to take steps in combating the hate speech.
""We are very clear in our site terms of service that posting content that incites violence will get users banned from Reddit,"" a company spokesperson  told CNET.
 Twitter
 The social networking service joined other Silicon Valley companies on Wednesday in suspending accounts linked to the Daily Stormer.

 At least three accounts that were associated with the neo-Nazi website led to pages saying ""account suspended,"" according to Reuters.
Although Twitter did not discuss individual accounts, the company released a statement saying that the social network will take action on accounts that violate its policies prohibiting violent threats, harassment and hateful conduct.
 Facebook
 The social media platform, which has doubled down on its war against fake news, confirmed to CNET that it has removed and banned group pages that violated hate speech policies.
 Facebook also confirmed that it had removed the Charlottesville Unite the Right event page and was currently removing all links to the aforementioned Daily Stormer post.

 Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg spoke out against the violence in Charlottesville on Monday.
She says: ""Along with millions of others, I was so heartbroken this weekend.

Let's honor her by teaching all of our children how to honor and respect those values.""

 Right now — with emotions running high days after white extremists violently clashed with counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, leaving one woman dead — that's a painfully delicate task.
And it's one that Zuckerberg admits Facebook won't get right all the time.
 ""It's important that Facebook is a place where people with different views can share their ideas. Debate is part of a healthy society,"" Zuckerberg says in a post he published on his personal Facebook page Wednesday night.
But that does not mean Facebook is granting carte blanche for anyone to post anything he or she professes to believe in.

 Facebook and severalother tech companies have taken a decidedly active role in blocking white supremacists from operating on the internet. For example, both GoDaddy and Google canceled the domain registration of a Nazi website, The Daily Stormer. Online payments processor PayPal cut off service to white supremacists groups and Airbnb canceled bookings of people who traveled to the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville. 
 ""There is no place for hate in our community. That's why we've always taken down any post that promotes or celebrates hate crimes or acts of terrorism — including what happened in Charlottesville,"" Zuckerberg says.
And, Facebook will continue to do so. ""With the potential for more rallies, we're watching the situation closely and will take down threats of physical harm.""
But even with an army of more than 20,000 employees, Facebook can not possibly individually monitor the activity of more than 2 billion monthly active users.
Zuckerberg knows there will be mistakes.
""We won't always be perfect, but you have my commitment that we'll keep working to make Facebook a place where everyone can feel safe,"" he says.
It's not the first time Zuckerberg has addressed the challenge of monitoring what users publish on Facebook. In an epic  manifesto published in February, Zuckerberg said that Facebook had made some mistakes in taking down content it shouldn't have.
 ""[T]he complexity of the issues we've seen has outstripped our existing processes for governing the community,"" the post reads.
""We saw this in errors taking down newsworthy videos related to Black Lives Matter and police violence, and in removing the historical Terror of War photo from Vietnam. We've seen this in misclassifying hate speech in political debates in both directions — taking down accounts and content that should be left up and leaving up content that was hateful and should be taken down.
""Both the number of issues and their cultural importance has increased recently,"" says the post.
""This has been painful for me because I often agree with those criticizing us that we're making mistakes. These mistakes are almost never because we hold ideological positions at odds with the community, but instead are operational scaling issues.""
His apology was largely seen as a courageous and necessary move as a leader.
Going forward, Zuckerberg says Facebook will allow and encourage discourse on the behemoth social media platform, within limits.
""When someone tries to silence others or attacks them based on who they are or what they believe, that hurts us all and is unacceptable,"" he says.
""There's not enough balance, nuance, and depth in our public discourse, and I believe we can do something about that. We need to bring people closer together, and I know we can make progress at that.""

 Alibaba's rally continues following strong earnings   
 2:46  PM ET Thu, 17 Aug 2017 |  01:50 
 This year may finally be the year that global investors put Chinese internet companies alongside American giants like Facebook and Amazon.
On Thursday, Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce giant, said its profit for the three months that ended in June almost doubled, while its revenue rose more than half. But just as impressive a jump was its stock price, which has increased more than 80 percent so far this year. Now Alibaba and its biggest Chinese rival, Tencent Holdings, have valuations that hover around $400 billion.
By contrast, Amazon.com has a valuation of about $470 billion, while Facebook is at about $490 billion.

Investors are becoming more aware that Alibaba and Tencent have become central to the day-to-day entertainment, shopping and spending habits of China's middle class. Tencent, which offers  extremely popular video games and social media services, reported on Wednesday its own surge in quarterly profit, sending its shares higher still.
But like its American peers, high valuations lead to high expectations.
 The numbers
Alibaba said its fiscal first-quarter profit rose 94 percent to $2.2 billion, thanks to strong sales. Sales across its e-commerce businesses rose 56 percent.
Alibaba's sales have surged as Chinese statistics show consumers in the country continue to do more and more of their shopping online. In that sense, Alibaba's growth is tracking China's efforts to transform its economy to rely more on American-style consumption and less on government spending.
That does not make it infallible. Alibaba's results rely on its online marketplaces, which face growing competition and could someday be hit by a slowdown in growth either from the Chinese economy or from internet adoption in a still-developing country. To diversify, Alibaba has been expanding into entertainment and cloud computing and looking for new opportunities overseas, where it faces competition from its American peers.
 The technology
The strong growth also cloaks a more complicated picture. Over the past year, Alibaba's increase in revenue has outstripped the actual value of the goods being sold on its e-commerce websites. That means that the company has been able to earn more off the vendors who sell everything from name brands to knickknacks on its sites.
Alibaba makes money from vendors by charging them for advertising on its platforms, among other services. New technology and  some of its  corporate deals have given it access to new and better data that give it more power to target those vendors.
That approach has kept Alibaba's results strong despite a slowdown in growth of the total value of goods being sold on its platform. But it is not clear how long it can keep that phenomenon going, fueling its effort to find new consumers and expand into new businesses.
 Jack Ma goes to Washington
As part of that push, Jack Ma, Alibaba's charismatic founder, has been barnstorming across the American political landscape over the past year. A sort of ambassador for the company, Mr. Ma met with President Trump and held a conference in Detroit. His goal has been to persuade more American vendors to get on Alibaba and sell to a Chinese middle class that craves foreign goods.
By attracting more vendors from overseas, Alibaba is able to bring in more big advertising spenders, and support its revenue growth.
Helping his cause was  a settlement announced this month between Alibaba and Kering, the luxury goods giant that owns the Gucci brand and had filed a lawsuit in 2015 charging counterfeit goods had been sold from Alibaba's e-commerce websites.
 The Amazon aspect
As Alibaba looks abroad, it may finally directly compete with that other e-commerce giant, Amazon. In Southeast Asia, where Alibaba owns an online commerce platform called Lazada, it will probably face a new Amazon initiative in the region.
Some have wondered whether Mr. Ma is simply following Amazon's game plan. Just as Amazon has done, Alibaba has started a cloud computing business, bought into a high-profile newspaper, worked to begin creating its own entertainment content, and more recently made bold predictions about unmanned retail stores that will use smartphones to automatically charge customers.
Still, there are some ways in which Alibaba is different. The biggest one is its financial affiliate, Ant Financial, which is responsible for trillions of dollars in money transfers each year. As it looks to expand the business overseas, it has bid for MoneyGram, a remittance company that would give it new exposure to America. As American regulators review that deal, much will depend on Mr. Ma's political maneuverings.

 Conservatives plan attacks against tech giants in net neutrality fight   
 6:53  PM ET Fri, 18 Aug 2017 |  00:42 
 A leaked memo written by the president of a conservative lobbying group shows how the right could attack Facebook, Google and Twitter over alleged political bias, according to a new report in Axios.
 The report highlights a brewing battle over how much control internet providers and platforms should have when it comes to unpopular political viewpoints.
For instance, Google revoked domain registration services for the online neo-Nazi publication Daily Stormer this week, effectively kicking it off the internet until it could find a new provider. Cloudflare, which provides defense against hack attacks, also canceled service for the Daily Stormer, in a move that Cloudflare's CEO admitted could set a dangerous precedent. And Facebook reiterated that it would remove posts that celebrate ""hate crimes or acts of terrorism,"" in the wake of a neo-Nazi demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia, last week.
 Now, one conservative activist has floated the idea of forcing internet platform companies to declare themselves editorially neutral, or lose protection against liability for what their users post on their platforms. 
 The net neutrality battle
 The impetus for the memo is the ongoing battle over net neutrality.
Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and a Republican, is preparing to scrap rules on net neutrality put in place by his Democratic predecessor, Tom Wheeler, during the Obama administration.
The net neutrality fight pits online content providers such as Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix against broadband service providers such as AT&T, Verizon Communication and Comcast.
In broad terms, telco and cable companies argue that tech companies' web traffic uses their networks, and they'd like more freedom to set prices. 
One way they could do this would be to create tiered packages or bundles of content, based on business deals with content creators — similar to the way cable networks package TV channels today — and restrict or slow access to content that isn't in those packages. Providers haven't explicitly said they want to create tiered services or packages, but they argue they should have the freedom to experiment. Wheeler's rule prevented this experimentation, they argue.
The tech giants and their allies, however, argue that all traffic should be treated equally, or neutrally, as has been the case since the beginning of the internet. The internet's innovation would be curtailed if providers could favor certain traffic, they argue.
The latter argument won the day the last time the net neutrality fight was in court, when a federal appellate court upheld the rules Wheeler put in place.
Pai's move to reverse those rules is likely to trigger another round of fights in Congress, the courts, or both.
 What the memo suggests
 The memo, written by Phil Kerpen of an activist organization called American Commitment, suggests that conservative lawmakers could reframe the battle over net neutrality into a larger battle over neutral speech on the internet. 
""Social media (Facebook, Twitter) and search (Google) companies with dominant market position represent themselves as politically neutral while systematically promoting liberal views and limiting or even banning conservatives,"" begins the letter.
Right now, online platforms are protected under the Communications Decency Act from liability for material their users post. For instance, while a newspaper can be sued for libel if it prints something untrue written by a reporter, Facebook cannot be sued because a user posts something libelous.
Kerpen's memo suggests that the government should make internet companies promise that they're going to treat all content equally or lose this protection.
""Platforms that represent themselves to the public as neutral would be subject to enforcement actions if they violate those representations (of neutrality) through a consumer-protection framework.""
The political calculus here seems to be that Google and Facebook would look like hypocrites if they oppose this kind of regulation while at the same time arguing for regulation of internet access providers.
""By simply proposing this framework, the Trump administration would make clear that the asymmetry of companies identified with conservative causes risking regulatory retaliation while companies identified with liberals are given a free pass is over.""
Kerpen told Axios that the memo represented only ""preliminary thoughts.""
But it's an interesting glimpse into a possible political attack from the right on Silicon Valley companies.

 Alphabet unseats Facebook as favorite stock among hedge funds   
 3:50  PM ET Fri, 18 Aug 2017 |  00:57 
 Google parent Alphabet recaptured its place as hedge-fund darling in the second quarter this year, breaking a recent tie with Facebook.
 In a rating of hedge funds' top 10 holdings, 16 held Alphabet in the most recent quarter, topping the 15 hedge funds holding Facebook, Citi Research analyst Tobias Levkovich wrote in a note Thursday.
Facebook lost its tie among hedge-fund favorites with Alphabet from the first quarter of 2017, when 13 funds held shares of both tech companies in their top 10. The social media behemoth was gaining momentum from a dip after tying in the second quarter of 2016, but ceded ground most recently to Time Warner and NXP Semiconductors.
 ""Six of the top seven names owned by hedge funds are in the Information Technology sector,"" Levkovich said.
Mutual funds overwhelmingly love Microsoft, the reigning champion for the last five quarters, but the blue chip stock is less favored among hedge funds. Apple ranks even further behind, as a top 10 holding for only five hedge funds.

 The corporation Mark Zuckerberg founded to solve big problems is growing like a tech start-up, not a charity   
 10:53  AM ET Fri, 18 Aug 2017 |  00:53 
 The entity started by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, to tackle big global problems is growing more like a tech start-up than a typical charitable organization.
 A review of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's website and other online pages indicates it has just over 160 employees, with open positions for 38 — numbers confirmed by a source close to the organization.
That's just 20 months after its founding in December 2015.
 The number of engineers has exploded during the past year, surging from just three people to nearly 100. 
And Chan Zuckerberg looks set for another fresh infusion of cash, after Mark Zuckerberg sold a large amount of Facebook shares this week earmarked for his these efforts.
He sold at least $25.5 million worth, according to a company securities filing, on top of the $32.5 million sold last month for the benefit of the Chan Zuckerberg Foundation and CZI Holdings.
That's a drop in the bucket compared with the billions of dollars Zuckerberg and Chan have pledged toward the organization, whose mission is ""advancing human potential and promoting equality.""
The couple pledged to donate $1 billion a year toward it, and last year created a new investment vehicle, Chan Zuckerberg Science, that will put $3 billion toward the lofty goal ""to help cure, manage or prevent all disease by the year 2100.""
That's not the only big problem Chan Zuckerberg has taken on.
In an 'Ask Me Anything' session on the discussion website Reddit this week, a group of Chan Zuckerberg scientists said they're working on the Human Cell Atlas project.
That's a global effort to map all 30 trillion cells in the human body, similar to how the human genome project identified genes.
Its ambitions and deep pockets aren't the only things that make the Chan Zuckerberg organization unique.
It's also organized as an LLC, not a nonprofit foundation. While that eliminates any tax benefits for Zuckerberg — one of the world's wealthiest people — it also gives the initiative more flexibility on how to spend it, as he explained in this post. Zuckerberg has pledged to plow any profits from investments back into the initiative to advance its mission.
Zuckerberg devotes one day a week toward the effort, while Chan spends more time there.
All of which means something may have to give if, as has been widely speculated, Zuckerberg should decide to use another portion of his fortune to finance a political career.

 });Priscilla Chan (R) and her husband Mark Zuckerberg announce the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to ""cure, prevent or manage all disease"" by the end of the century during a news conference at UCSF Mission Bay in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 21, 2016.
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in an online post that he will take two months' paternity leave later this year.
 Zuckerberg's wife, Priscilla Chan, is expecting the couple's second child by year's end.
""Studies show that when working parents take time to be with their newborns, it's good for the entire family,"" Zuckerberg said.
 Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Chief Financial Officer David Wehner will be highest-ranking executives in his absence. He could have taken up to four months off under Facebook policy.
Facebook shares are up more than 40 percent this year, far outpacing gains in the broader market for tech stocks.
The company's market value has risen more than eightfold since it went public in May 2012, making it the fourth-most valuable U.S. tech firm.

Deborah Liu of Facebook
 Facebook has big plans for  Marketplace, the Craigslist-like section inside its app where people can sell used goods to others in their neighborhood.
It's just not sure what those big plans should look like.
So to figure that out, Facebook is throwing a bunch of products inside Marketplace to see what people want, including more professional products and services offered by actual retailers, not just regular Facebook users.
 Facebook now shows job postings inside Marketplace, and  recently started offering ""daily deals"" as part of a new arrangement with eBay. But Facebook has more categories coming to Marketplace, including ticket sales and products from retailers' shopping Pages, said Deb Liu, the Facebook VP who oversees Marketplace, in an interview with Recode.
Until now, Facebook has limited postings inside Marketplace to individual users, not business Pages. But that's changing as the company expands into more areas. Facebook hopes to learn what kinds of stuff people want to find inside Marketplace, then push deeper into those areas.
""We'll kind of look and see what's popular, what people want to engage with,"" Liu said. ""So if people are searching or looking for something, we want to make that available to them.""
One popular area has been auto sales, so Liu says Facebook will soon feature cars for sale inside Marketplace from local car dealerships. It plans to do the same with real estate listings to increase inventory for apartment hunters.
Facebook did not share details about who, specifically, it was planning to partner with for these categories. And the company did not highlight any specific retailers during our conversation.
So Facebook wants higher-quality options inside Marketplace, but it's unclear where they will come from.
Still, some of these more traditional retail options, like  ticket sales and  shopping pages, already exist inside Facebook. They're just scattered throughout the app, and it's possible most people don't even know they exist. Which is one of the reasons Facebook is bringing them all into  one central location, Liu said.
More from Recode:
 Uber investor Shervin Pishevar claims Benchmark wants to remove Arianna Huffington from the board SoftBank's Plan B: Win over Uber investors who aren't Benchmark Some startup founders are 'nervous' about dealing with Benchmark after it sued Uber 
One area it doesn't plan to push into: Payments. Right now, Facebook connects buyers and sellers, but the actual transactions still happen off site. Facebook isn't making money from any transactions it helps facilitate, and that's not going to change anytime soon.
""Eventually, we could go in a number of different directions [with payments],"" Liu said. ""But right now we're really trying to figure out, 'how do you actually drive engagement between people and businesses, people and other people locally?' That's how we really think about the product.""
Facebook has tried to get commerce to stick inside the social network for years without much success. It  closed a gifts service, and dabbled with ""buy buttons"" that never took off.
Marketplace is Facebook's latest hope — and the changes raise the question of whether they are being made because the initial version of Marketplace hasn't taken off. But Liu says Marketplace has had ""tremendous growth,"" with 18 million items listed inside Marketplace in the U.S. alone back in May. But  not all of the items are high quality.
Given Facebook's ambitions here, and its willingness to get more established retailers and businesses using Marketplace, that could start to change.

27,2017-08-21,How to watch the eclipse from the comfort of your Facebook feed  ,"Getty Images
A solar eclipse is seen from Palembang city on March 9, 2016 in Palembang, South Sumatra province, Indonesia.
 Authorities in Oregon are warning people not to watch Monday's solar eclipse from the side of the road, concerned about jammed freeways and car crashes caused by distracted drivers.
 In California, officials who run the state's electric grid are preparing for a loss of solar power that could reach 67 percent. North Carolina could see a 90 percent drop in solar power supply.
Elsewhere across the U.S., consumers who bought special sunglasses are being urged to make sure they are truly 'eclipse-proof,' lest they risk severe eye damage. 
 As Americans from coast to coast await the coming total eclipse with a mix of excitement and dread, there is an alternative place to watch the solar spectacle: Facebook.
NASA will have a page dedicated to showing the event from a broad range of vantage points — including on the ground, aboard aircraft and even from the International Space Station.
The NASA coverage will feature a live, high-resolution, 360-degree view of the eclipse, using Facebook's Live 360 video tool, from Charlestown, South Carolina, starting at around 1:15 p.m. EDT until around 4:15 p.m. ET. 
Consumers can access the event either directly on the Facebook website or on their TV using the Facebook app.
And NASA isn't the only group getting charged up for the social media version of the event.
The American Astronomical Society, based in Washington, has a helpful map of the path of the eclipse on its Facebook page, which has 106,000 followers. (CNBC will also be streaming the eclipse on CNBC.com and on Facebook live from noon until 4 p.m. EDT.)
The Los Angeles Astronomical Society has helpful links on its Facebook page.
One points to a ""Precision Eclipse Computation"" page designed by mathematician and computer scientist Stephen Wolfram of Wolfram Research. It includes a detailed guide of what to expect based on where and when a person views the event.

 Astronomy Magazine has instructions on how to submit photos to its Eclipse Megamovie Project, whose first images will be available Monday night.
The Las Vegas Astronomical Society has information on optimum camera settings for capturing great photos of the event.
Monday will see the first full solar eclipse to cross the U.S. mainland in 99 years.

 Banks are faced with more competitive disruption from tech behemoths than financial technology (fintech) start-ups, according to a report by the World Economic Forum (WEF).
 Contrary to concerns surrounding small fintech firms drawing business away from the financial services sector, the report concluded that start-ups had less of an impact than expected.
""Fintechs have changed the basis of competition in financial services, but not the competitive landscape,"" Rob Galaski, co-author of the report and Canadian lead for financial services at Deloitte, said in a statement Tuesday.
 ""Fintechs now define the tempo and direction of innovation in financial services, but high customer switching costs and the rapid response of incumbents has challenged their ability to scale"".
Drawing on interviews with finance and tech industry experts, the report found that banks were significantly lagging behind tech giants in the development of technologies like cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data analytics.
Lenders have instead been turning to tech corporations to provide these functions, the report said. It singled out Amazon, Google and Facebook as three companies dominating the market in these areas of innovation.

Attendees stand near Amazon.com Web Services signage during the Station F startup campus launch party in Paris, France, on Thursday, June 29, 2017.
 One example the report referred to was Amazon Web Services, which has lured several financial institutions including Aon, Capital One and Nasdaq to Amazon's cloud computing business.
""The ability to be a fast follower has proven more important than being first for large financial institutions,"" Deloitte's Galaski added.
""Agile incumbents have used the fintech ecosystem as a supermarket for capabilities, making the ability to nurture and rapidly form partnerships a critical ingredient to banks' competitive success.""
 Not an isolated view
 Comments expressed in the report are far from unique to the WEF.
Today a blockchain specialist at IBM weighed in on the subject, arguing that some start-ups lacked a full understanding of the industry they were trying to disrupt.
""Some of the start-ups that are coming in don't necessarily understand the scope of the transactions that are running all the time, and when you think about banking as an $8-9 trillion industry – that's a lot of transactions,"" Brigid McDermott, IBM's vice president for blockchain business development, told CNBC via phone call.

 Blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, is a secure, decentralized network that records transactions. IBM revealed its ""Blockchain-as-a-Service"" platform earlier this year, to be used by several of Europe's largest banks.
McDermott added, ""When you come at it as a start-up and you're trying to look at a small part, do you really have a sense of what the transformation is that needs to happen?""
Big banks, however, are now trying to emulate the lending models of fintech leaders, says Jesse McWaters, financial innovation lead at the World Economic Forum.
""Fintech is making inroads in defining what the user experience of the future is,"" McWaters said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Tuesday. ""Lending Club and OnDeck have really defined what a lending experience should look like, and then you're seeing banks try and copy that as effectively as possible."" 
Two weeks ago Daniel Döderlein, CEO of Norwegian fintech startup Auka, claimed that various ""niche verticals"" — smaller vendors that cater to specific markets — could be bought up by larger players.
""There's a ton of companies out there that have more or less great technology, but they don't have the marketing muscle, they don't have consumer customers, and they don't have any financial traction,"" he said.

 USA Today: Facebook may have a grown-up problem   
 11:27  AM ET Tue, 22 Aug 2017 |  00:44 
 SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook will see a decline among teenagers in the U.S. this year, says market research firm eMarketer.
EMarketer predicts 14.5 million people ages 12 to 17 will use Facebook in 2017, a decline of 3.4% from the previous year, as they migrate to Snap's Snapchat and Facebook's Instagram.
Monthly Facebook usage among those under 12 and ages 18 to 24 will grow more slowly than previously forecast, too, according to eMarketer.
 The forecast suggests young people are turning away from the world's most populous social network, which reached 2 billion users this year.

 Facebook is losing its appeal among teens: eMarketer analyst

 More from USA Today:Bro culture is under attack, but women say it's far from tamedHow to prevent creeps from using Apple's AirDrop to 'cyber flash'Samsung's battle with Amazon and Apple heats up
It's a grown-up problem for Facebook which needs young users to develop the habit of checking Facebook so it can show them ads well into adulthood.
EMarketer forecasting analyst Oscar Orozco says teens and tweens, seem less engaged on Facebook, logging in less frequently and spending less time there. Instead, he says, they are migrating to Snapchat and Instagram.
What's more: There are now ""Facebook nevers,"" children becoming tweens who are skipping Facebook altogether.
Snapchat usage is expected to increase this year, with the U.S. user base to grow 5.8% to 79.2 million monthly. EMarketer increased growth projections for all age groups except the oldest, with the biggest jump in young adults, ages 18 to 24 increasing nearly 20%.
Similarly, monthly Instagram usage in the U.S. will grow 23.8% in 2017 to 85.5 million. Within that figure, Instagram will expand its user base among those under 12 years old by 19% and those ages 12 to 17 by 8.8%.
Facebook declined to comment.
""Both platforms have found success with this demographic since they are more aligned with how they communicate – using visual content,"" Orozco said in an eMarketer blog post.
According to eMarketer, this marks the first time eMarketer has ever predicted a decline in Facebook usage for any age group.
For years there have been warnings that Facebook was losing its cool with young people.
Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion in search of the fountain of youth.
In 2013, Facebook's former chief financial officer David Ebersman admitted that young teens were hanging out on Facebook less frequently.
Subsequent surveys found that Facebook was still alright with kids.
When Facebook's $3 billion-plus takeover offer was rebuffed by Snap, the parent company of Snapchat that is popular with teens, it opted for the next best thing: cloning the buzzy chat app's features on Facebook and Instagram.

 On Monday, more than 66 million people commented, posted and reacted to the solar eclipse on Facebook, according to data from the social media giant. That's about 2 million more than the  64 million people who were talking about the 2017 Super Bowl on the site.
Billionaire Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was no exception. He shared three beautiful shots from atop the Prineville, Ore., data center, taken with a time lapse camera. The center was in the path of totality.
 The 66 million people had 240 million ""interactions,"" which includes posts, reactions, shares and comments. That was roughly the same number of ""interactions"" seen during the Super Bowl.

Snap cofounders Evan Spiegel (C) and Bobby Murphy ring the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with NYSE Group President Thomas Farley shortly before the company's IPO in New York, U.S., March 2, 2017.
 Wall Street may finally be warming a bit to Snap.
 On Tuesday, the stock price rose more than 6 percent — if Snap holds those gains, it will have ended in the green for five of the past six sessions.
The jump came amid a forecast that fewer teens would use Facebook this year, opting for Snapchat and Instagram (which is owned by Facebook) instead. Data from eMarketer, released this week, project 14.5 million consumers ages 12 to 17 will use Facebook this year, a 3.4 percent year-over-year decline — which would be a first for Facebook.
 The data also suggest that this year Snapchat could overtake Instagram and Facebook itself in terms of total users in the coveted 12 to 24 age group.
Still, trading volume was light and choppy: About 27 million shares of Snap changed hands mid-afternoon Tuesday, below the 30-day average of about 33.5 million.
The new report comes amid the end of Snap's so-called lockup period at the end of August. Although insiders are now allowed to sell their shares, many have opted to stay long the company, according to SEC filings and comments from executives.
History indicates that the end of August should lift pressure from Snap: LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook all bottomed within a week of their lockup expiration, according to MKM derivatives strategist Jim Strugger.
The stock had a nasty selling streak for much of the summer, and shares are still down more than 28 percent over the past three months as two disappointing quarterly reports weighed on shares.

 Advertising mogul Martin Sorrell told CNBC on Wednesday his company is poised to increase its investment in Facebook to ""well over"" $2 billion this year.
 WPP, the world's largest advertising group, will keep Google as its top media investment in 2017. However, Sorrell suggested the firm's client portfolio could be set to see Facebook move ahead of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in second place.
""Google ranks number one in terms of the destinations of our media investments. Facebook ranks third (but) may this year actually become second,"" the CEO of WPP told CNBC on Wednesday morning.
 Sorrell explained WPP's investment in Google amounted to approximately $6 billion, while the amount put in to Mark Zuckerberg's social media network is set to increase to more than $2 billion in 2017, up from $1.7 billion in 2016. Google's parent Alphabet has a market capitalization of about $646 billion and Facebook $492 billion.
 Snap a 'flea on the elephant's backside'
 When asked about WPP's decision to double its investment in Snap from last year despite a number of market jitters, Sorrell described the group's commitment as a ""flea on the elephant's backside"".
""Our spending on Snap for example which last year was $100 million and our spending this year is projected at $200 million pales in to relative insignificance to the investment that is made in to Google…or in Facebook.
""That doesn't mean, I have to say, that Snap does not present an alternative in the long term,"" he added.
Wall Street appeared to show signs it may finally be warming to Snap on Tuesday. The stock closed 7 percent higher after an industry report projected that fewer teens would use Facebook in 2017, opting for Snap or Instagram instead.
Snap has endured a prolonged selling streak for much of the summer and despite closing higher for five of the past six sessions, the stock is still down around 28 percent over the past three months.

 Facebook is bringing live football to its redesigned video tab this fall — just not the NFL games that it had originally hoped for.
Facebook announced a deal on Wednesday with Stadium, the 24/7 digital sports broadcaster, to stream 15 college football games exclusively on the platform. Stadium owns the rights to the games, and will produce them specifically for the social network, meaning they won't air on TV or anywhere else online.
Facebook has been trying to collect sports rights and livestreams for the past year, but  most of what it's secured has been either niche or not exclusive to Facebook.

The company has streamed some NBA and  MLB regular season games, but those were available in other places. It also recently inked its most high-profile deal, an agreement with Fox Sports to  stream some Champions League soccer matches, arguably the top soccer tournament worldwide outside of the World Cup. But those streams are also not exclusive.
The good news about Wednesday's deal is that Facebook is getting exclusive video of a sport people actually want to watch: College football.
The bad news is that unlike the  NFL games Facebook made a run at earlier this year, the games it's getting won't be very high-profile.
Facebook will stream nine Conference USA games and six Mountain West games, which means you'll be able to watch schools like Idaho State, Utah State and North Texas. Unless you're an alum from one of the schools playing, or you like to bet on football, you probably won't have much incentive to watch. (Although, Wyoming will play twice on Facebook, and Wyoming quarterback Josh Allen could be a  top-five NFL draft pick next year.)
Still, the deal gives Facebook more live sports to put inside its  redesigned video tab, which it unveiled earlier this month. The premise of the tab is to get more professionally produced videos and shows onto Facebook so that users have a good reason to treat the social network as a video destination akin to YouTube or TV. Facebook hopes to ultimately sell ads against those higher-quality videos.
Facebook declined to share financial details about its arrangement with Stadium, but a spokesperson did say the company is ""investing in the content,"" which makes sense given Stadium owns the rights and is producing the games. Facebook won't sell ads or commercials against these games ""at the outset,"" the spokesperson added.
Here's a look at the schedule of games, all of which will stream globally.

 But it's his mentality as an engineer and hacker that he suggests his employees can learn from today.
While the self-made billionaire probably no longer pulls all-nighters coding,  Zuckerberg discusses what he's learned from transitioning from an engineer to CEO in an interview with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman for his podcast, Masters of Scale. 
 ""This is a really interesting shift, from being an engineer to running an organization,"" he says. ""One of the great things about being an engineer is that you can actually go build something yourself,"" Zuckerberg tells Hoffman.

 ""When you switch to building an organization, what you learn is that you're doing a bunch of different things, and that you can't do things yourself,"" says Zuckerberg. 
Now, he says, it's important to delegate.
""If I want to accelerate the development of something,"" he says, ""the best thing that I could do is not go work on it myself, but make sure that a really good person is working on it full-time.""

 At Facebook, Zuckerberg tries to share this mindset with other employees. 
 ""When I do performance reviews with folks, a lot of the review is not just based on what they do over the period of the performance review,"" he says. Instead, he asks: ""Do you have a good successor? Are all your key positions filled?"" 
Zuckerberg says he values those who are doers to help grow Facebook for the future: ""I think good engineers and good technical entrepreneurs have that instinct where, when there's something they want to build, just go do it.""
""Be entrepreneurial about it,"" he adds, ""and be a hacker and go do it.""

 Facebook has put long-time executive Andrew Bosworth in charge of all consumer hardware efforts as it readies a video calling device for release next spring, according to a new report in Business Insider.
 Bosworth, who was most recently vice president of the company's ads and business platform, has worked at Facebook since 2006.
A close confidant of CEO Mark Zuckerberg,  he has previously led efforts on other vital Facebook products, including the News Feed and mobile ads.
 The report comes as Facebook tries to play catch-up with fellow tech giants Alphabet and Amazon, which have launched home-assistant devices that also allow voice calling, and Apple, which is reportedly readying something similar.
""Hardware has hardly been an area of strength for Facebook,"" says Scott Kessler, a financial analyst with the firm CFRA, who has a buy rating on its shares. ""They are far behind"" rivals, Kessler says.
The new hardware device, code-named 'Aloha,' will reportedly allow Facebook users to make video calls and use facial recognition. It's due out next spring, says the report.
Bosworth's new role will put him in charge of any hardware being built by Building 8, the company's skunkworks unit led by former Google executive Regina Dugan, and other consumer products including Oculus virtual reality gear.

 To do this, Zuckerberg says his company mostly hires people who, even if they are already executives at their previous jobs, take on smaller roles at Facebook before hiring them for leading positions.
 ""Everyone who's going to be a VP or product group lead here really needs to earn that,"" Zuckerberg tells Hoffman.
 Zuckerberg adds how proud he is of the company's product groups — the teams that oversee ads, News Feed, Instagram and WhatsApp, for example — that have leaders who were promoted from other jobs at Facebook and now report directly to him.

 Executive Edge: Palihapitiya creating new tech holding company   
 12:22  PM ET Tue,  5 Sept 2017 |  02:02 
 Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya is about to try his hand at being Warren Buffett. Or something like him.
 Palihapitiya, the founder of Social Capital and former member of the senior executive team at Facebook, is listed as CEO of a new ""blank check company"" called Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. 
The holding company is aiming to raise $500 million in an IPO to then go out and acquire emerging private businesses that have little incentive to go public themselves — because of the hassle of quarterly earnings, gyrating stock prices and the constant questions over how they'll compete with Amazon and Facebook.
 For reference, just check out the stock charts of Snap and Blue Apron.
 ""Our mission is to create an alternative path to a traditional IPO for disruptive and agile technology companies to achieve their long-term objectives and overcome key deterrents to becoming public,"" the filing said.
Palihapitiya has long criticized the traditional venture model and expressed his admiration for Buffett, who has spent more than 50 years building Berkshire Hathaway into a giant publicly-traded holding company, filled with food businesses, insurers and industrial brands. 
At a StrictlyVC event in 2015, Palihapitiya said that Social Capital is going to be more like a ""bastard stepchild of Berkshire Hathaway and Blackstone and BlackRock"" than a traditional venture firm.
One big difference, though, is that Buffett has largely avoided tech companies because he's struggled to figure out how to value them. Palihapitiya's endeavor is all about uniting ""technologists, entrepreneurs, and technology-oriented investors,"" the filing said.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter, that Palihapitiya's team is planning to meet with investors early next month and launch the offering by mid-month on the New York Stock Exchange.
Hedosophia is a venture firm with offices in Hong Kong and London. Ian Osborne, CEO of Hedosophia, will be president of the new holding company. The rest of the management team comes from Social Capital and the board includes former Skype CEO Tony Bates and former Twitter executive Adam Bain.

 Facebook shuts down 1 million accounts per day but can't stop all 'threat actors,' security chief says   
 4:58  PM ET Thu, 24 Aug 2017 |  00:59 
 Facebook turns off more than 1 million accounts a day as it struggles to keep spam, fraud and hate speech off its platform, its chief security officer says.
 Still, the sheer number of interactions among its 2 billion global users means it can't catch all ""threat actors,"" and it sometimes removes text posts and videos that it later finds didn't break Facebook rules, says Alex Stamos.
""When you're dealing with millions and millions of interactions, you can't create these rules and enforce them without (getting some) false positives,"" Stamos said during an onstage discussion at an event in San Francisco on Wednesday evening.
 Stamos blames the pure technical challenges in enforcing the company's rules — rather than the rules themselves — for the threatening and unsafe behavior that sometimes finds its way on to the site.
Facebook has faced critics who say its rules for removing content are too arbitrary and make it difficult to know what types of activity it will and won't allow.
Political leaders in Europe this year have accused it of being too lax in allowing terrorists to use Facebook to recruit and plan attacks, while a U.S. Senate committee last year demanded to know its policies for removing fake news stories, after accusations it was arbitrarily removing posts by political conservatives.
Free speech advocates have also criticized its work.
""The work of (Facebook) take-down teams is not transparent,"" said Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which advocates for free speech online.
""The rules are not enforced across the board. They reflect biases,"" says Galperin, who shared the stage with Stamos at a public event that was part of Enigma Interviews, a series of cybersecurity discussions sponsored by the Advanced Computing Systems Association, better known as USENIX.
Stamos pushed back during the discussion, saying ""it's not just a bunch of white guys"" who make decisions about what posts to remove.
""When you turn up the volume on hate speech, you'll get more false positives, (and) catch people who are just talking about it,"" rather than promoting it, Stamos said.
The company also must operate within the laws of more than 100 countries, some of which use speech laws to suppress political dissent, he said.
""The definition of hate speech in some countries is problematic,"" Stamos said.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said the company will hire 3,000 extra workers to monitor and remove offensive content.
That effort continues apace, according to Stamos, who said the company is ""massively expanding our team to track threat actors.""
Still, ""you can't do all that with humans,"" he said, which is why Facebook also relies on artificial intelligence software to judge whether someone trying to log in is a legitimate user.
""The number of accounts turned off every day is (in the) seven figures or eight figures,"" Stamos said from the stage, with some fraudsters attempting to create thousands of accounts at once.
After the event, Stamos confirmed to CNBC that the number of accounts it closes is in excess of 1 million every day.

 ""TWTR's push to be a digital live video provider is interesting, but we note that bigger competitors such as FB & GOOGL have much stronger digital video propositions for advertisers with much larger and more engaged user bases, deeper granular data for targeting, and proven return on advertiser investment,"" Thill said.
Twitter has ""seen a steady improvement in engagement from its core users, but has yet to translate this into revenue growth,"" Thill said, noting that advertising revenues in the first half of the year for Twitter are down 6 percent versus the 15 percent gain for the industry.
Twitter year-to-date performance
 Thill and his team also cut their price target on Twitter to $16 from $20. 
Twitter shares closed 0.4 percent lower at $16.89 Thursday. The stock had shot up more than 40 percent from a 52-week low in April to a more than 9-month high in July amid reports of improved advertising revenues.
However, shares plunged in late July after the social media company's second-quarter earnings report disappointed in the number of new users and showed an 8 percent decline in advertising revenue to $489 million.
That said, the Jefferies analysts still gave Twitter the benefit of the doubt. 
Thill said he didn't downgrade the stock to sell because of its recovery in the last two years. 
""We believe recent management changes could help improve the declining [average revenue per user] in the near term,"" he said. ""We will pay close attention to advertiser sentiment over coming months and effectiveness of live video.""

Brandon Stanton, is the creator and photographer of Humans of New York which is to become a Facebook Watch TV Show.
 Humans of New York, a blog that features photos and short as-told-to biographies of everyday people, is getting its own TV show on Facebook's Watch platform.
 The project, which has more than 17.5 million followers on its Facebook page, is being turned into a 30-minute episodic TV show of the same name. The series will include interviews from over 1,200 interviews from over 400 days of filming, Facebook said in a statement. The show will debut next week, with episodes to be released weekly. (The news was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter.)
 The show is one that Facebook is paying to have on its Watch platform, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Humans of New York has also inspired two New York Times best-selling books, and includes stories outside of the New York area.
 Other Watch producers said Facebook was paying between $10,000 to $25,000 per episode for their programs. Companies including Group Nine Media, Hearst, Condé Nast Entertainment, Refinery 29, Quartz, Tastemade and NASA are creating content for the TV project. Watch is only available to a select group of U.S. users, but will roll out to more people eventually.
The series was created by Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton and executive produced by Julie Goldman, best known for her work on ""Life Animated"" and ""Weiner.""

The company has been trying to do that a lot more since it was widely criticized for  enabling the proliferation of so-called ""fake news"" during last fall's U.S. presidential election. Even before that, it was wrangling with allegations that the company suppressed conservative content from its trending news section, a troubling accusation considering Facebook has become  one of the world's largest news sources.
As part of its effort to look and feel more open to its user base, Facebook has talked a lot about its efforts to fight fake news, and recently launched a blog post series titled ""Hard Questions,"" where the company talks a bit about hot-button issues like hate speech or terrorism.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also been traveling the country meeting with regular people in America's heartland to better understand life outside of the Silicon Valley bubble.
Zuckerberg has talked publicly and also  wrote a massive blog post about Facebook's broader mission and responsibility to use technology like artificial intelligence to help fight things like fake news, but also encourage more people to have conversations about controversial topics.
He and other Facebook execs have been debating internally how best to communicate this and more, although it is unlikely we will get the down and dirty on every decision that impacts users.
(Suggestion: One thing we could use some transparency on is how Facebook seems to be so specific when  suggesting people for you to connect with.)
Still, Facebook plans to expand from the ""Hard Questions"" blog to do more, including posts from guest commentators who disagree with the company (egads!) and how things like its algorithm work. It is also considering related events, studies and more.
While not an exact comparison, since it is more limited, Google has tried to do similar things related to its news offerings, such as the Google News Lab. That unit works on things like data journalism and immersive storytelling.
Spayd is an interesting choice for the job. She had been the latest to pen an independent column about the newsgathering process at the news organization, representing its readers. But the position was eliminated altogether by the Times brass earlier this summer.
Spayd has also been one of the more controversial public editors to have served at the Times, attracting criticism for a number of columns. She noted that in  her last column:
 I leave this job plenty aware that I have opinions — especially about partisan journalism — that don't always go over well with some of the media critics in New York and Washington. I'm not prone to worry much about stepping in line with conventional thinking. I try to hold an independent voice, to not cave to outside — or inside — pressure, and to say what I think, hopefully backed by an argument and at least a few facts. In this job, I started to know which columns would land like a grenade, and I'm glad to have stirred things up. I'll wear it like a badge. 
She arrived at Facebook only weeks ago and is working in a consulting role from its Silicon Valley HQ and also from New York, where she lives.
Interestingly, she is unlikely to write a lot on Facebook's blog, said the spokesperson, who noted she is not meant to have a highly visible role — such as recently hired former TV journalist Campbell Brown, who was hired as the company's  head of news partnerships in January.
Instead, Spayd's role will be as an outsider who is inside, one who pushes boundaries at Facebook.
Presumably, we'll see how hard she is allowed to do that in the months to come. It is clear that Facebook is also doing this to be more thoughtful about its major impact on society, but also because it looks good to do so.
(Full disclosure: Spayd and Kara Swisher worked together at the Washington Post's business section almost 25 years ago, where Swisher was a nascent but already annoying reporter and Spayd was a patient top editor. Remarkably, they still get along.)

Zuckerberg says he and Chan are doing ""everything we possibly can to make sure the world is a better place for you and all children in your generation.""
Zuckerberg and Chan are not just paying lip service, either. Their Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has pledged to raise billions, including Zuckerberg's personal fortune from Facebook, to solve major global problems in the areas of health and education. One of the stated goals is to help cure, prevent or manage all human disease by the end of the century.
 Here's the letter:
 Dear August, Welcome to the world! Your mom and I are so excited to see who you will become.  When your sister was born, we wrote a letter about the world we hoped she and now you will grow up in — a world with better education, fewer diseases, stronger communities, and greater equality. We wrote that with all the advances in science and technology, your generation should live dramatically better lives than ours, and we have a responsibility to do our part to make that happen. Even though headlines often focus on what's wrong, we still believe these positive trends will win out. We're optimists about your generation and the future. But rather than write about growing up, we want to talk about childhood. The world can be a serious place. That's why it's important to make time to go outside and play. You will be busy when you're older, so I hope you take time to smell all the flowers and put all the leaves you want in your bucket now. I hope you read your favorite Dr. Seuss books so many times you start inventing your own stories about the Vipper of Vipp. I hope you ride the carousel with Max until you've tamed every color horse. I hope you run as many laps around our living room and yard as you want. And then I hope you take a lot of naps. I hope you're a great sleeper. And I hope even in your dreams you can feel how much we love you. Childhood is magical. You only get to be a child once, so don't spend it worrying too much about the future. You've got us for that, and we'll do everything we possibly can to make sure the world is a better place for you and all children in your generation. August, we love you so much and we're so excited to go on this adventure with you. We wish you a life of joy, love and the same hope you give us. Love, Mom and Dad 
Zuckerberg has said that he would take two months paternity leave from Facebook, in keeping with the company's policies.

 });Saying ""happy birthday"" can be as simple as a few clicks. On Facebook, in fact, ""more than 45 million people give birthday wishes"" every day, according to the social media website.
 Now, you can add a dollar amount to those good wishes.
 A new feature announced Aug. 16 allows your Facebook connections to send you money on your birthday — but that money must be donated to a charitable cause or nonprofit.
 ""People often dedicate their birthday to support a cause, and we've seen people using Facebook to raise money for causes they care about,"" the site says in a news release.
""For those in the [United States], we're now making it easier to do this by giving you the opportunity to create a fundraiser for your birthday directly on Facebook.""

 Facebook
Donate through Facebook on your birthday for a charitable cause or nonprofit.
 Two weeks before your birthday, Facebook will show a prompt in your news feed that gives you the option to create a fundraiser for 750,000 available nonprofit organizations.
You'll set a goal amount and create a custom message, and, on your birthday, your friends will receive a notification inviting them to donate to that cause. The fundraiser will end at midnight.
After friends donate, they'll receive a receipt by email, according to the release. Their names and the amount of their contribution will be shared with the charity as well as with the creator of the fundraiser.
If a nonprofit is registered with  Facebook Payments and has received at least $100 in donations, it becomes eligible, Facebook says. If the organization has not received at least $100, the funds will roll over until it has.
For nonprofits not registered with Facebook Payments, donations are distributed electronically via the online fundraising platform  Network for Good. And if the nonprofit isn't registered with that network, a check is mailed to the organization.
 Facebook
Donate through Facebook on your birthday to a cause like an animal rescue or autism.
 Facebook charges a five percent operational fee on donations. Three percent covers payment processing and two percent covers the cost of fraud protection and payment support.
In addition to donating to nonprofits, users can also set up fundraisers for a personal cause. They must follow Facebook's community standards and abide by the personal fundraiser categories policy. For personal-cause donations, Facebook charges 6.9 percent, plus $.30 of the donation for fraud protection.
""Birthdays have always been a part of Facebook,"" the site says in the release. ""We hope to continue providing you with a variety of experiences that make celebrating on the platform fun and meaningful for you and your friends.""
The ability to donate on Facebook is not offered in every area. For more details on making and receiving donations, visit the site's fundraisers and donations page.

 To productively sort through your email, you may want to take a pointer from Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, who says she can't imagine her life  without email.
Sandberg's top timesaving hack is to ""try to answer emails immediately,"" she tells LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman in his podcast, Masters of Scale.
 Staying on top of messages that come into her inbox is part of how Sandberg is able to help manage a 20,658-person company.
""I would rather give a short, quick, incomplete answer than wait and do it better,"" Sandberg says.

""'Done' is better than perfect,"" she says. ""People underestimate how opening up your emails again is so time-consuming because you read it again.""

Lavar Ball and LaMelo Ball look on from the audience during week eight of the BIG3 three on three basketball league at Staples Center on August 13, 2017 in Los Angeles, California.
 Basketball's current most famous family, the Balls, are headed to Facebook.
 ""Ball in the Family"" -- which features father LaVar Ball, mother Tina Ball and their three sons, Los Angeles Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball, UCLA freshman LiAngelo Ball and Chino Hills High School player LaMelo Ball — is a reality TV series about the basketball crew as their sons prepare to go professional.
The first two episodes of the series will debut on Thursday on Facebook Watch, with subsequent episodes posted every Sunday starting on Sept. 10. 
 Facebook Watch is Facebook's new TV platform, which lives as a tab on its main Facebook app. Companies including Group Nine Media, Hearst, Condé Nast Entertainment, Refinery 29, Quartz and Tastemade are creating content for the project. It will also be home to live events including MLB games. Shows range in length, with most creators saying their episodes are about five to seven minutes.

 Cramer Remix: This is the only company that can stop Facebook   
 7:09  PM ET Thu, 31 Aug 2017 |  01:25 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer has been known to take fantasy football way too seriously, and on Thursday, he took it to the next level.
 ""It's time for me to show my reality, not fantasy, but reality stock team, the one I drafted in my head last night while I was busily putting together what could be a championship Skidaddy Ski team, which, of course, competes in the Mad Money Schlumpadicka league,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Alphabet and Facebook were Cramer's choices for running backs because even though their stocks seem overvalued, investors won't regret paying those prices later, he said.
 ""Facebook's a stud. I don't even know if there's an analogue in the NFL as I've never seen anything like this company,"" Cramer said. ""Facebook's one of those backs that gets all-purpose yards for doing nothing but being a platform for two billion people. No NFL player has ever had that kind of pull. The only company that can stop Facebook is Instagram and Facebook owns it!""
 Ingevity CEO Sees Resurgence in Oilfields

 As commodity watchers mark every turn of the crisis in Houston, the nation's energy capital, Ingevity President and CEO Michael Wilson offered CNBC a promising take on the state of the oil market.
""When we saw the collapse in oil prices back in 2015, we saw demand destruction. What we did is we went back to the laboratories, reformulated products to take cost out but to keep the efficacy of those products for our customers. And we've been very successful at that,"" Wilson told Cramer on Thursday. ""And then since the beginning of this year, we've seen a real resurgence in our oilfield business. So it's definitely coming back.""
Wilson pointed to the number of oil rigs as a loose measure for the comeback. They peaked in 2014, when there were about 2,000 rigs in place, the count bottomed at 400 rigs and has since been climbing. As of last Friday, there were 940 rigs in the United States.
 Analog Devices' 'Mosaic' of Growth Drivers

 To counter the rising interest in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, Cramer wanted to explain why individual companies do still matter to these funds and the overall market.
""What was behind the incredible rally in non-FANG tech yesterday?"" the ""Mad Money"" host asked on Thursday.
Cramer argued that it wasn't Warren Buffett's endorsement of Apple or the small jump in shares of Netflix.
""No, it was all about a little company called Analog Devices,"" Cramer said. ""Of course, it's not really little anymore. It's a $30 billion semiconductor company, and it reported a terrific quarter and held a brilliant conference call.""
 Informatica CEO on Serving Top Tech Giants
 Then, Cramer spoke with Anil Chakravarthy, the CEO of privately-held data management company Informatica.
Chakravarthy told Cramer on Thursday that even though Informatica helps integrate and bring data to companies including Amazon, Salesforce and Microsoft, it isn't affected by competition.
""We partner very well with Salesforce, with Amazon, with Azure, with Google, so we partner really well with anybody who is in the analytics space. We don't do that. We bring data to them,"" the CEO said. ""We like to call ourselves 'from mainframe to the internet of things and everything in between,' and that's how agnostic we are.""
And as Amazon develops artificial intelligence for its voice-enabled devices, Informatica is working on a slightly different AI application of its own, Chakravarthy said.
""We use artificial intelligence to find what data you have where,"" he told Cramer. ""A lot of customers deal with so much data. They don't even know basic answers to basic questions, like how many databases do I have? Where do I have customer data? What data is secure? And this is all over the place, in their own enterprises, in the cloud, and it's growing every day. And AI is a great way of answering those basic questions.""
 FMC Corporation: The Right Chemistry?
 Finally, Cramer turned to FMC Corporation, a diversified chemical company with a stock that has climbed almost 50 percent since the ""Mad Money"" host recommended it in January.
""From the beginning, ever since I started recommending FMC, I've argued that this is an overlooked company with a stock that simply doesn't get the respect it deserves from Wall Street. Even after its recent run, that's still true,"" Cramer said.
From its fast-growing lithium business to its deal with DuPont for that company's crop protection business, FMC has a lot going for it, Cramer contended.
Pierre Brondeau, FMC's president, chairman and CEO, responded to CNBC's request for comment on Cramer's piece in an email.
""We're excited about where we are today and more importantly about the opportunities ahead of us,"" Brondeau wrote. ""Our transaction with DuPont crop protection will fundamentally reposition our Agricultural Solutions business as an innovation-led tier-one Agricultural technology company. The acquisition will significantly enhance our portfolio with strong IP protection, world-class innovation capabilities, and a strong pipeline of active ingredients that will feed new product introductions over the next decade and beyond. We expect FMC to be one of the fastest growing crop protection companies in the years to come.""
Brondeau added that it was gratifying to see investors and commentators support management's initiatives.
""We are equally excited about our Lithium business, which is a leading supplier of high-value specialty lithium products. FMC is investing across our product lines to increase capacity in order to respond to strong market demand for our products. Additionally, we believe that spinning off this business as an independent company in 2018 will unlock shareholder value. We think the next several years promise to be among the most exciting in FMC's nearly 135 year history,"" the CEO wrote.
And for now, Cramer was on board with FMC's prospects.
""Just because FMC's stock has climbed relentlessly higher, that doesn't mean you've missed a thing. I'm not kidding,"" Cramer said. ""[There's] a lot of value creation still to come. If you don't already own FMC, I suggest waiting for the next big market-wide pullback, and then do some buying.""
 Lightning Round: I Struggle With UAA
 In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
Under Armour Inc.: ""I struggle. I struggle. I struggle. Because I was on the Foot Locker call, and then I've done a lot of work in this group, whether it be Finish Line, whether it be what's going on with the Hibbetts of the world, and, of course, Dick's, and I have to come back and say no thank you. I don't want to touch that stock.""
Chesapeake Energy Corporation: ""No, you know, look. With that, you've got to hope for a cold winter. We did not get the summer that they needed to be able to get the thermostat going so that people would buy it. And don't forget, the oil patch is no place to be right now.""

 ""Snapchat could see financial success not by necessarily gaining share from Facebook or Instagram but rather by carving out a space for itself as a mobile-first, youth-focused digital video network,"" says Brandon Verblow, an associate forecast analyst at Forrester and author of the research company's latest social media advertising forecast.
Verblow suggests that Snapchat could compete with the likes of Viacom's networks such as VH1, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central, which generated $4.8 billion in ad revenue last year, says Forrester's report.

Snapchat and Facebook logos pictured on smartphones
 While some of Facebook's young audience is tiring of advertising on the platform, Snapchat users seem to have a higher tolerance. More than a quarter (26 percent) of US Facebook users aged 12 to 17 think it has too many ads, versus 11 percent for Snapchat, according to Forrester's online research which surveyed more than 3,000 young consumers in the U.S.
Still, Facebook grew the most of all the social platforms in 2016, with 75 percent of global social ad dollars spent on it, and it is likely to start making serious money from video advertising. ""While Facebook video runs the gamut from user-generated animated GIFs to slickly-produced news videos from CNN, we expect that ad spending will be skewed toward the latter TV-style videos,"" Verblow states. Forrester expects that commercials within TV networks' content will provide most of the video ad growth.
Earlier this month, Facebook launched Watch, to help users discover videos outside their news feed more easily, and in July announced higher than expected Q2 earnings driven by sales of mobile video ads. Its revenue for the quarter was $9.32 billion, versus an expected $9.2 billion.
Snapchat meanwhile launched daily news service ""Stay Tuned"" with NBC in July, with revenue split between the two. Snap did not immediately respond when contacted by CNBC.

 Facebook has mapped the entire human population of earth as it prepares to build an internet in space   
 2:33  PM ET Fri,  1 Sept 2017 |  01:02 
 Facebook doesn't only know what its 2 billion users ""Like.""
 It now knows where millions of humans live, everywhere on Earth, to within 15 feet.
The company has created a data map of the human population by combining government census numbers with information it's obtained from space satellites, according to Janna Lewis, Facebook's head of strategic innovation partnerships and sourcing. A Facebook representative later told CNBC that this map currently covers 23 countries, up from 20 countries mentioned in this blog post from February 2016.
 The mapping technology, which Facebook says it developed itself, can pinpoint any man-made structures in any country on Earth to a resolution of five meters.
Facebook is using the data to understand the precise distribution of humans around the planet.
That will help the company determine what types of internet service — based either on land, in the air or in space — it can use to reach consumers who now have no (or very low quality) internet connections.
""Satellites are exciting for us. Our data showed the best way to connect cities is an internet in the sky,"" Lewis told about 150 people gathered in San Francisco this week for a Space Technology and Investment Forum sponsored by the Space Foundation.
""We're trying to connect people from the stratosphere and from space,"" using high-altitude drone aircraft and satellites, to supplement Earth-based networks, said Lewis.
Facebook hired Lewis, a former intellectual property lawyer with extensive experience in international aerospace law, about one year ago.
Her job, as she told the forum, is to work with partners in the aerospace industry to build a multi-pronged network to serve the entire planet.
The data is used ""to know the population distribution"" of Earth to figure out ""the best connectivity technologies"" in different locales, Lewis said. ""We see these as a viable option for serving these populations"" that are ""unconnected or under-connected,"" she said.
In addition to Lewis, Facebook is also hiring aerospace engineers to help it crack this market.
The mapping technology is part of a much broader effort by U.S. companies to take advantage of a slew of data now available from the hundreds of satellites orbiting the earth.
""All this satellite data is coming from space, so people are trying to figure out what the business opportunities are,"" says Edward Swallow, senior vice president for civil and commercial systems for the Aerospace Corporation, an entity set up by the government in 1960 to protect America's pre-eminence in space.
Facebook rival Google, for example, sold its satellite-imaging business, formerly called Skybox, earlier this year ""because they figured out they could get the data without having its own satellites,"" Swallow told CNBC in an interview.
 Cheaper launches, more data
 Space-related investment and market development are being driven by two things: the plummeting cost of launching satellites and the wealth of data they produce.
New aerospace companies, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and Virgin Orbit, have driven down the cost of launching a satellite into low Earth orbit dramatically.
Thanks to companies founded by this ""billionaire boys club"" — as some at the space investing confab referred to them — a company can now get a payload into space for as low as ""tens of thousands of dollars per kilogram,"" said Monica Jan, senior director of strategy and customer experience for Virgin Orbit.
Before these companies entered the market, satellite launches typically cost millions or even billions of dollars, said Jan, who has worked in the aerospace industry for decades.
Virgin Orbit, based in Long Beach, California, was spun out of Virgin Galactic earlier this year to focus on small-satellite launches.
When asked by CNBC what she took away from Lewis' earlier presentation, she said ""it sounds like they [Facebook] want to create a multi-tier system,"" or one that uses networks based on Earth, in the stratosphere and in space.
 A space-based internet
 All of this activity has been spurred by the increasing commercialization of space, which was formerly an expensive realm inhabited by nations alone.
Of the 576 U.S. satellites now in orbit, 286 — or roughly half — were launched for commercial reasons, according to Steve Butow, the West Coast military lead for the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, or DIUX.
The DIUX was set up during the Obama administration to speed the deployment of new technologies into the U.S. armed forces.
The end result of all this investment will likely be a ""space-based broadband data network"" that will be the basis of ""a new space economy,"" Butow told the space investing confab in San Francisco.
If and when that becomes a reality, Facebook will be ready for it.
Correction: A Facebook spokesperson clarified that the company has mapped population densities in 23 countries, and is exploring the idea of using satellites to expand internet access.

 });We start each year laser focused on the goals we set for ourselves, yet  research shows that about 80 percent of people fail to reach them.
 But Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has a different approach to goal-setting, which can help you succeed. She calls them non-goals, or secondary goals employees should focus on only after the main goal has been met.
In order to achieve these ""non-goals,"" Facebook's leaders ""talk a lot about ruthlessly prioritizing,"" Sandberg tells LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman  in an interview for his podcast,  Masters of Scale. Despite overseeing a 20,658-person company, Sandberg says doing this is vital because Facebook has only ""so many resources.""
 Sandberg has championed this rule of ""ruthless prioritization"" for years now, going back to a conference in 2011.
She poses a common situation: Say you have three really great ideas, but you can only do two. Which one do you settle on not doing?

 });
 ""You have your goals and non-goals,"" Sandberg says.""The non-goal is the next thing that you would do, because it's a really good idea.""
Separating the good ideas from the bad ideas is easy, Sandberg says, and is commonly mistaken for how you can get your priorities straight. What's tougher is actually narrowing down the good ideas you plan to take action on, she adds. That's where non-goals can help, she says.

 A prime example: Facebook's advertising business. Sandberg had been at Google for seven years, developing its successful online advertising program, before she was brought on to Facebook to help it  scale globally and develop its  advertising network.
Sandberg tells Hoffman that for a long time, Facebook's non-goal for advertising was that ad network, which most recently earned the company $9.16 billion in the second quarter of 2017.
""It was a good idea,"" Sandberg says, but before Facebook could get to the ad network it ""had to build [its] own ad systems and targeting and measurement systems first.""
A non-goal can still be a great idea, Sandberg notes, adding: ""It set a floor for what we were going to invest in that everyone could understand, and it made it theirs.""

 Facebook's WhatsApp unit will eventually start charging companies to contact its users, a person close to the company says, as the social media firm looks to make money from its chat products.
 WhatsApp, which said in August it has 1.3 billion users, has begun testing tools that could allow businesses to offer sales and support services to its users who agree to be contacted.
The features include a separate WhatsApp application for businesses that are verified by the company.
 In a blog post Tuesday, WhatsApp wrote that business chat services are coming in various tiers.
""We're building and testing new tools via a free WhatsApp Business app for small companies and an enterprise solution for bigger companies operating at a large scale with a global base of customers, like airlines, e-commerce sites, and banks,"" the company wrote.
Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014 and has yet to focus on turning the popular chat app into a money maker.
WhatsApp said last year it would eventually begin testing tools that could let users communicate with companies via secure messages, part of a broader overhaul to make the service more business friendly.
The features are being tested by companies in Brazil, Europe, India and Indonesia, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier, citing an interview with WhatsApp's chief operating officer, Matt Idema.
Idema didn't describe the paid features to the paper or say when they would be rolled out. 
""We don't have the details of monetization figured out,"" Idema told the Journal.

 Facebook: $50,000 in election ad spending from Russia   
 4:19  PM ET Wed,  6 Sept 2017 |  00:46 
 An internal Facebook investigation has found it is ""likely"" Russian operatives spent $100,000 on ads with ""divisive messages"" between June 2015 and May 2017. 
 A blog post on the issue, which was published on Wednesday, said the operation involved 3,000 separate ads over a two-year period and was likely to have been run out of Russia. In addition, Facebook found 470 affiliated fake accounts and pages. 
About $50,000 of the funds — about 2,200 ads— were potentially related to impacting U.S. politics. The majority of the ads did not reference the U.S. presidential election, voting or a specific candidate. However, the ads focused on ""divisive social and political messages"" about hot-button topics including LGBT rights, race issues, immigration and gun rights. Facebook has shared its findings with U.S. authorities.
 Facebook previously said in April it found evidence some groups used its platform to sway the outcome of the recent election. It did not specify targets or who was behind the attack, but said its own findings did ""not contradict"" a U.S. Director of National Intelligence report in January about Russian efforts to influence the election.
The company has introduced technology improvements like machine learning to detect fake accounts, in addition to more tactics to stop the spread of misinformation and fake news. Some solutions also include decreasing the influence of ""spammers"" who spread false news links, lowering the number of articles with ""clickbait"" headlines that exaggerate information or do not present a full picture, and blocking pages from advertising if they share stories that have been flagged as being false.

 });It's de rigeur for the many of the richest of the rich to tout the benefits of giving cash handouts to all American citizens, in part as a way to end poverty. The idea, called universal basic income (UBI), is for every individual to be paid a regular sum of money regardless of employment status. 
 One of the tech elite who has an interest in universal basic income is self-made multimillionaire and Y Combinator President Sam Altman. ""Eliminating poverty is such a moral imperative and something that I believe in so strongly,"" Altman tells CNBC Make It.
""There's so much research about how bad poverty is. There's so much research about the emotional and physical toll that it takes on people.
 ""I think about the amount of human potential that is being wasted by people that are not doing what they want to do. I think about how great it would be to undo that. And that's really powerful to me,"" he says.
 ""I think about the amount of human potential that is being wasted by people that are not doing what they want to do.""
-Sam Altman, President of Y Combinator
 Indeed, poverty affects how children's brains develop and how well children perform on tests, according to a 2015 study published in the medical journal, JAMA. Poverty is also a cause of poor physical health. According to the World Bank, this is because poor people don't have the resources they need to learn about good health or the access to health care.

 });
 So under Altman's leadership, Y Combinator, a top start-up investment and mentorship program, is doing an experiment to better understand UBI — giving the residents of Oakland, Calif. cash handouts to see how the money affects individuals' behavior. Y Combinator has hired a program director and the study is underway, but but Altman declines to share any further updates.
In recent months, tech billionaires Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Richard Branson have all publicly talked about universal basic income as a possible solution to both poverty and impending mass of unemployment as a result of automation and artificial intelligence.

 Some have taken umbrage with the idea that titans of industry, from their thrones of extreme wealth, are taking pity on those whom they may well have exploited to get to the pinnacle of capitalism.
Altman himself sold his first company, Loopt, for more than $43 million. Since 2014, he has been running Y Combinator, which has the likes of Aribnb, Dropbox and Stripe in its portfolio. The combined valuation of the start-ups Y Combinator has funded is north of $80 billion.
He has noticed the increased attention universal basic income is getting and has been surprised by it. Unlike the skeptics, he's encouraged — eliminating poverty is a goal that should be a priority for everyone, he says.
""Why is it okay for somebody that's in the middle class to say, 'Hey, I think we should eliminate poverty' but not okay for Zuckerberg to say that?"" says Altman to CNBC Make It. ""I am happy to hear people in poverty talk about it. I am happy to hear billionaires talk about it.""

 Mark Zuckerberg: Alaska's cash handout program ""provides some good lessons for the rest of the country""   
 12:40  PM ET Wed,  5 July 2017 |  01:07 
 In his commencement speech at Harvard, Zuckerberg said that growing up in a financially stable household (his father was a dentist) meant that he had the freedom to try launch Facebook, which currently has a market capitalization of $488 billion. Zuckerberg himself, at 33 years old, is worth  $70 billion, according to Forbes.
Altman does not begrudge Zuckerberg his billions, nor does he find his comments on cash handouts tone deaf.
""I don't like to blame the wealthy for all the problems. I would be more willing to blame the politicians than Zuckerberg, but I don't think Zuckerberg has done anything wrong. In fact, I think he's created a product that he deserved to get really rich for,"" Altman says to CNBC Make It.
""He was born, as he has said, into a lucky circumstance, which allowed him to take a risk and that's not fair. Everybody should be allowed to take a risk, whether they were born to rich or poor parents. That's part of what something like a basic income might do. So again if people are saying, 'Hey, I really benefited from not growing up in poverty, and I was able to take a risk and it paid off but I wouldn't have been able to take that risk if I was in poverty. So I think we should eliminate it for everybody else,' that feels really consistent to me. It's something that I respect.""
Altman also has a 10-point agenda for improving his home state, California, in addition to his UBI efforts.
Says Altman: ""I think if we can eliminate poverty for all Americans, that's a really good thing to do.""

 An analyst at a small research firm is reiterating his negative call on Facebook shares alleging the company may be overstating its ad reach for certain age demographics in the U.S. and other countries.
 Pivotal Research reaffirmed its sell rating on the social media giant, also predicting its profitability will decline as it transitions to more video content advertising. 
Facebook shares declined 0.4 percent midmorning Wednesday after the report.""Facebook is establishing itself as a destination for premium video content, and demonstrating a willingness to pay significant amounts of money for that content. Facebook can likely drive revenue growth to offset content costs, albeit at lower margins than what the company currently generates,"" analyst Brian Wieser wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.
 ""However, because of measurement issues the company has faced in the past (and possibly a new one identified by a trade publication in Australia and replicated by us within the United States), we think the primary winner of Facebook's expansion in video will be third party measurement firms,"" he added. Facebook has been one of the best-performing large-cap stocks in the market. Its shares rallied 48.4 percent year to date through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 9.8 percent return. ""Measurement issues at Facebook have been top-of-mind for many of those same marketers over the past year given revelations around over-stated average video viewing time, video viewing completions, miscalculations of organic page reach and other data which impacts how budgets are planned,"" he wrote.
Facebook apologized for overstating video viewership times in September of last year. The company said a metric for average user time spent on videos was artificially inflated. Wieser cited Australian trade publication AdNews, which revealed last week ""Facebook's claims to reach 1.7mm more 16-39 year-olds in Australia than exist in the country according to its census bureau."" The analyst also potentially found a similar issue in the U.S.:
 ""Specifically, through Facebook's Ads Manager we can see that Facebook claims a potential reach within the US of 41mm 18-24 year-olds, 60mm 25-34 year-olds and 61mm 35-49 year-olds. By contrast, US Census data indicates that last year there are a total of 31mm 18-24 year-olds, 45mm 25-34 year-olds and 61mm 35-49 year-olds."" 
As a result, Wieser reaffirmed his year-end $140 price target for the company, representing 18 percent downside from Tuesday's close. ""Conversations with agency executives on this topic indicate to us that the gap between Facebook and Census figures is not widely known,"" he wrote. Wieser reduced his rating on Facebook shares to a hold from buy on Feb. 1. Facebook's stock has rallied 28.1 percent since his earlier downgrade. Facebook sent the following statement in response to this story:
 ""Reach estimations are based on a number of factors, including Facebook user behaviors, user demographics, location data from devices, and other factors. They are designed to estimate how many people in a given area are eligible to see an ad a business might run. They are not designed to match population or census estimates. We are always working to improve our estimates.""

 Estimated 'likely' Russian election spending on Facebook a 'very small' $150,000   
 9:26  PM ET Wed,  6 Sept 2017 |  01:37 
 Facebook has turned over all information about ads ""likely"" purchased by Russian operatives to special counsel Robert Mueller, according to a report.
 A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that the social media giant had sent the former FBI director data including copies of the ads and the identity of the buyers. That report followed news that an internal Facebook investigation found it is agents of the Kremlin may have spent $100,000 on ads with ""divisive messages"" between June 2015 and May 2017.
A Facebook blog post published on Wednesday said the operation involved 3,000 separate ads over a two-year period and was likely to have been run out of Russia. In addition, Facebook found 470 affiliated fake accounts and pages.
 Mueller is investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin. The investigation has dogged and frustrated President Donald Trump, who has called it a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax.""

Facebook founder and chief Mark Zuckerberg receives the Axel Springer Award in Berlin on February 25, 2016 Facebook announced it was donating computer servers to a number of research institutions across Europe, starting with Germany, to accelerate research efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
 Facebook's ad sales team is hitting up the drug industry.
 On Thursday, the company's New York-based health unit hosted an invitation-only breakfast for pharmaceutical marketers to learn about targeting users for their clinical trials.
CNBC viewed a copy of the invitation, which asked participants to attend a presentation on the company's ""new clinical trials strategy.""
 Facebook is already widely used by clinical trial recruiters. The sector is a massive revenue opportunity for the company.  Research firm eMarketer estimates that pharma and health-care marketers will spend $3.1 billion on digital advertising by 2020, up from $1.9 billion last year.
According to a person who attended Thursday's event, Facebook detailed how drug marketers can and can't target users. The source requested anonymity because Facebook did not make the details public. 
 Facebook's health team explained that users can't be targeted based on health conditions like insomnia. This is not limited to clinical trials. 
Marketers can target people by demographics and their expressed interests, or likes. Millions of health groups have organically popped up on Facebook for people with a variety of health conditions, though marketers can't use that data in their outreach.
Some drug companies have been reluctant to use Facebook due to concerns that patients will share sensitive information like medical side effects and adverse events. Pharmaceutical companies are required to monitor and report these comments.
This wasn't Facebook's first event for drug marketers. CNBC reported in May that the company was hosting a summit the following month to pitch its platform as an alternative to traditional television and print media ads.

 Facebook is blocked in China, but it is feeling comfortable enough there to look for its own place.
The social media giant in recent months has quietly scouted for office space in Shanghai, according to two people with knowledge of its efforts there. Those offices would house employees working on Facebook's effort to make hardware but could also help with its broader ambitions in China, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the plans.
Facebook's plans are tentative, the people said, and would depend on approval from the Chinese government. But if successful, it would be a symbolic victory for the social network, which has long worked to get into China despite being blocked there for nearly a decade.
 ""We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,"" a Facebook spokeswoman said in response to questions about the office plans.
More from The New York Times:
 In China, Facebook Tests the Waters With a Stealth App Silicon Valley Giants Confront New Walls in China Facebook Tells Advertisers It Can Reach Many Young People. Too Many. 
Facebook has been looking for momentum in China, home of the world's largest population of online users. Earlier this year, it quietly authorized the release by a small local company of a Chinese version of its Moments photo-managing app.
Despite being obstructed in China, Facebook has many reasons to continue pursuing business there. The social network sells advertising to Chinese companies hoping to reach the rest of the world. The Chinese ad sales, supported from its office in Hong Kong, are some of the largest in Asia. Even China's government propaganda organs use it.
Facebook's new hardware ambitions would require a Chinese presence as well. The initiatives would require plugging into China's electronics supply chain, which helps build some of the world's most popular gadgets, like Apple's iPhone. The office would first be used by employees of Facebook's hardware effort, called Building 8, according to the people with knowledge of the plans. Anything from an internet-connected medical device to a drone requires coordination with dozens of Chinese producers and assemblers, mostly located in the southern part of the country.
Facebook has for years entertained the idea of a Chinese office. In late 2015, it obtained a license to open an office in Beijing, but the permit lasted only three months and it could not establish a space in that time. Oculus, the virtual reality company Facebook bought three years ago, already has a Shanghai office.
At the moment, Facebook uses third parties and its own employees to sell ads in China. Because of cybersecurity concerns, Facebook employees run special security software on devices when they travel in China and do not have access to secretive or critical business information.
Opening an office in Shanghai allows more support for its employees when they are in China, but also raises security questions. The Building 8 teams, which focus on their own hardware projects, would have less need to access sensitive Facebook data when in China, one person said. The office could also help Facebook work more with local Chinese companies.
If it opens a Shanghai office, Facebook would not be the only Western internet company banned in the country to have some space there. Google, which pulled its servers out of China in 2010 after it decided to stop censoring search results, retained offices in Beijing and Shanghai that support both advertising and research and development. Google still maintains extensive advertising sales and research facilities there.
Facebook over the past three years has pulled out all the stops to court the Chinese government and gain approval for its network. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder and chief executive, has showed off his Mandarin at one of the country's top universities and has directly courted Xi Jinping, China's president.
The office search comes just months after Facebook released the Chinese-language version of Moments. That app, called Colorful Balloons, originally went largely unnoticed but briefly rose into the top 50 in the photo and video section of China's iPhone app store after The New York Times reported its release last month, according to app research company App Annie.
Like other cities in China, Shanghai has been eager to attract technology start-ups and other internet-related investments.
Earlier this year, a woman listed as the executive director of the company that released Colorful Balloons on Facebook's behalf was photographed at a meeting between Shanghai government officials and Facebook. In order to open an office in Shanghai, Facebook will likely have to register a branch company in Shanghai as well.
That the Colorful Balloons app has not come down could be a sign that Facebook has done something right with the government, said Teng Bingsheng, a professor at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business. Opening an office, if it happens, would be another sign.
""It has symbolic meaning,"" Mr. Teng said, ""because it must be the result of good communication with the government.""

39,2017-09-08,Facebook will spend as much as $1 billion on original TV in the next year  ,"David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook
 The Wall Street Journal reports that Facebook is going into the next year ""willing to spend as much as $1 billion"" on original video content, building out the roster of exclusive TV on its revamped video tab Watch.
In June, the WSJ reported that Facebook was willing to pay up to $3 million per episode for centerpiece shows, and was also interested in original sitcoms with episodic budgets in the six-figures. At the time, VP of media partnerships Nick Grudin told The Verge in an email, ""We're funding these shows directly now, but over time we want to help lots of creators make videos funded through revenue sharing products like Ad Break."" Eventually, Facebook wants to pay nothing for the original shows, instead offering the creators a 45 percent share of their ad revenue.
Even a $1 billion investment is still a fraction of what Facebook's digital competitors, like Netflix ($6 billion in 2017) and Amazon ($4.5 billion) shell out, and WSJ reports that the number could fluctuate based on the success of the first crop of shows. However, it's an aggressive hike from previous investments.
 Last year, Facebook put up $50 million to pay celebrities and brands (including The Verge's parent company Vox Media) to make content for its then-new Live platform. As of April, the company has been touting this as a success, announcing that one in five videos shared on the platform are live-streamed. In May, Facebook announced a new partnership with several media brands — including Vox Media and BuzzFeed— in which it would pay up to $35,000 for episodes of 5- to 10-minute shows that the companies would own and Facebook would get a 45 percent cut of the ad revenue from. The same week, Facebook announced a deal to stream one Major League Baseball game per month. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reportedthat the company was offering ""hundreds of millions"" to music publishers in exchange for the rights to songs in the background of user-generated content.
Facebook's plan is that Watch, and all of the original content it buys for it, will make TV, like everything on its platform, a social experience. Product management leader Daniel Danker said last month, ""You discover videos through your friends. You often find yourself discussing videos with friends. Video has this amazing power to bring people together and build community."" All of Watch's shows have comments enabled and some are incorporated into Facebook Groups.
This news comes a month after WSJ reported that Apple would spend $1 billion on original content in the next year.

 Snap's user growth will be weaker than expected, according to one Wall Street firm. Deutsche Bank on Monday lowered its rating on Snap to hold from buy, citing the competitive threat of larger internet firms. ""After broad conversations across the ad ecosystem over the last month, feedback was decidedly mixed,"" analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note to clients. ""Facebook's efforts to copy Snap's product (on a best-in-class ad platform) has also somewhat obviated the imperative some had around Snap a year ago; many feel they can get the key younger audience via Instagram."" Snap shares have been extremely volatile since its IPO. The stock declined 48 percent from its high, reached days after the company went public on March 2. It is also down 10 percent from the $17 IPO price, but up 36 percent from its all time low in mid-August. Walmsley reduced his price target on Snap to $17 from $20, representing 11 percent upside from Friday's close. The analyst cited how he talked to Snap's content and technology partners, along with advertisers in recent weeks. ""Marketers are just not as interested in Snap. The exciting new platform buzz seems to have shifted to Amazon of late,"" he wrote. As a result, Walmsley lowered his net daily active users (DAU) quarter-over-quarter growth estimate for the September quarter to 4.5 million from 7.5 million. ""We continue to see an attractive LT opportunity given product innovation and improving ad tech,"" he wrote. ""But we believe new products may take longer to improve the DAU trajectory, and note a reduced imperative for advertisers to experiment with Snap advertising."" Snap did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 The Campaign Legal Center is urging Facebook to release the content of political ads purchased by Russian nationals and displayed on Facebook, most notably during the 2016 presidential campaign cycle.
 CNBC obtained an advance copy of a letter sent Tuesday to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg from CLC President Trevor Potter. The nonprofit watchdog group accuses Facebook of having been ""used as an accomplice in a foreign government's effort to undermine democratic self governance in the United States.""
The letter urges Zuckerberg to release the ads and ""allow the country to better understand the nature and extent of foreign interference with our democracy.""
 Facebook  recently announced that more than 3,000 ads were purchased by approximately 470 fake users between 2015 and May of this year. The company has so far refused to release the content of the ads, which it said, ""appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum — touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.""
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.
The letter marks the latest sign of growing pressure Facbeook faces from Washington, where members of Congress are demanding more information into how the Russian bots managed to purchase the ads and what Facebook will do in the future to prevent foreign influence campaigns.
One congressional critic is the ranking member of the powerful Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who recently said he believes the Facebook announcement was merely ""the tip of the iceberg.""  Speaking at a security conference, Warner also signaled that he expects more transparency from companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google about who is purchasing ads.
The Campaign Legal Center is a nonprofit watchdog group in Washington, D.C., that monitors adherence to campaign finance laws and disclosure requirements. It recently hired Walter Shaub, a former director of the Office of Government Ethics who resigned in July after repeatedly clashing with the Trump administration.

 Martin Shkreli apologizes for bizarre Facebook post offering cash for Hillary Clinton's hair   
 11:47  AM ET Wed, 13 Sept 2017 |  00:59 
 Martin Shkreli apologized Tuesday for a bizarre Facebook post about Hillary Clinton's hair that threatens to land him in jail , saying he used ""poor judgment"" with ""my awkward attempt at humor.""
 Shkreli's mea culpa was attached to a letter that his lawyer sent a judge asking her not to revoke the $5 million release bond of the bombastic ''pharma bro.''
And it came just 24 hours before Wednesday's scheduled hearing on a request by prosecutors to lock him up, and just days after Shkreli taunted those prosecutors and their request online.
 Shkreli, 34, last week encouraged followers of his Facebook page to grab samples of Clinton's hair from her head and said he would pay them $5,000 per sample.
The post sparked an inquiry from the U.S. Secret Service – and led federal prosecutors to ask Judge Kiyo Matsumoto to jail Shkreli as a potential danger to the community.
""His recent public conduct demonstrates that he cannot meet his post-trial burden to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that he does not pose a danger to the community,"" the prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York wrote.
Prosecutors noted that Shkreli pulled this latest stunt just weeks after being convicted of three securities fraud-related counts in Brooklyn federal court, crimes for which he has yet to be sentenced.
""I wanted to personally apologize to this Court and my lawyers for the aggravation that my recent postings have caused,"" Shkreli wrote in the letter.
""I understand now that some may have read my comments about Mrs. Clinton as threatening, when that was never my intention when making those comments.""
""I used poor judgment but never intended to cause alarm or promote any act of violence whatsoever,"" he wrote, adding that he had quickly amended his post to make clear he had just been joking.
""I want to assure Your Honor that I am not a violent person, have never personally engaged in any violent behavior, nor have I ever intentionally encouraged anyone to do so,"" Shkreli wrote.
""I apologize for my behavior and ask you respectfully not to change my bail status so that I may continue to assist my attorneys to prepare for my sentencing.""
Last week, Shkreli took a very different stance toward prosecutors after they complained to Matsumoto about his Clinton hair bounty.
In a Facebook post, he wrote: ''F--- the government. I will never kiss their ring or snitch. Come at me with your hardest because I haven't seen anything impressive yet.''
In the past several days, however, Shkreli has spoken to his lawyers, and apparently changed his tune, according to a letter from his high-powered defense attorney, Benjamin Brafman.
Brafman, in that letter to Matsumoto, wrote, ""While we do not condone Mr. Shkreli's comment, his constitutionally-protected political hyperbole does not rise to the level of making a 'danger to the community' when he is not and has never been considered to be a danger.""
Brafman said that Shkreli should not be jailed because he ""never intended any harm or violence.""
The lawyer disputed prosecutors' contention that comments Shkreli made online about Clinton and a journalist, Lauren Duca, constitute an escalate pattern of threats,
Brafman suggested that Shkreli, who claims to be a supporter of President Donald Trump, was engaging in ""political hyperbole"" or ""satire"" in his comments about both women.
Brafman cited the fact that comedian Kathy Griffin was not prosecuted after she posted online a photograph of herself holding what appeared to be the bloody, severed head of Trump.
""Another example of political hyperbole is when President Donald Trump, as a candidate, caused a controversy last year by implying that 'Second Amendment people' could prevent former Secretary Clinton from abolishing their right to bear arms.""

 Pharmo Bro Martin Shkreli behind bars after bizarre Facebook post   
 8:40  AM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  01:37 
 An angry federal judge revoked the $5 million bond of convicted fraudster Martin Shkreli on Wednesday and ordered him jailed after ruling the notorious ""pharma bro"" was a danger to the public because of his offer on Facebook of cash for samples of Hillary Clinton's hair.
 Judge Kiyo Matsumoto's ruling came at a hearing in Brooklyn federal court where Shkreli's high-powered lawyer Benjamin Brafman pleaded with her for nearly an hour not to toss him in jail despite what the attorney said was a ""stupid"" Facebook post.
And it came a day after Shkreli, 34, apologized for posting a $5,000 bounty last week to any of his 70,000 Facebook followers who grabbed some of Clinton's hair, saying he used ""poor judgment"" with ""my awkward attempt at humor.""
 ""It's not going to happen again,"" Brafman vowed about his client, who has a long history of baiting adversaries online. ""I'm asking you ... to give him a chance to be more appropriate.""
Federal prosecutor Jacquelyn Kasulis, who appeared to be seething about the disgraced pharmaceutical executive's posts about Clinton and other women, said Wednesday, ""I think this escalating pattern of violence against women is incredibly disturbing.""
""He is reckless. He knows exactly what he is doing. He needs to go in,"" Kasulis said to a packed courtroom that included Shkreli's father.
""It is clearly beyond any reasonable doubt that Mr. Shkreli is a danger to the community. He's not special, by any stretch of the imagination,"" Kasulis said.
Matsumoto said she didn't find anything funny about either Shkreli's posts about Clinton, or his online boasts during his trial in July that he would get to ""f---"" a female journalist with whom he has feuded since January, as well as a female political pundit, once his trial ended.
 ""He is soliciting an assault on another person for $5,000,"" Matsumoto said. The judge noted that no one knew whether any of Shkreli's followers would take him up on that bizarre offer, either in a legitimate desire for the cash or in a bid to gain Shkreli's approval.
She noted that even when Shkreli tried to portray the offer as satire in a subsequent Facebook post, he wrote that he would pay the bounty only if the hair included a follicle.
""The fact that he continues to remain unaware ... of the inappropriateness of his actions or words demonstrates to me he may be an ongoing danger or risk to the community,"" Matsumoto said.
The judge also noted that once defendants are convicted in federal court, as Shkreli was in August, there is a legal presumption that their bail will be revoked.
""I''m going to remand Mr. Shkreli,"" Mastumoto said.
A somber-looking Shkreli, wearing a purple dress shirt and a shaggy mop of hair, was taken into custody by two deputy U.S. Marshals just after 6 p.m. ET as his grim-faced legal team stood by.
""We are obviously disappointed,"" Brafman said outside the court to reporters. ""We believe the court arrived at the wrong decision but she's the judge and right now we will have to live with this decision.""
""It's unfortunate. It was unfortunately avoidable, but the judge has ruled and she's the judge,"" the lawyer said.
Shkreli will be held in a federal jail, the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, until his sentencing on securities fraud charges on January 16, which Matsumoto scheduled Wednesday.
Shkreli's Facebook post last week about Clinton sparked an inquiry from the U.S. Secret Service, who also in response beefed up their protective measures for the former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee amid her ongoing book tour.
Prosecutors then asked Matsumoto to jail Shkreli, saying in a court filing that ""his recent public conduct demonstrates that he cannot meet his post-trial burden to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that he does not pose a danger to the community.""
Prosecutors pointed out that Shkreli's latest stunt came just weeks after being convicted of three securities fraud-related counts in Brooklyn federal court. 
Brafman, at Wednesday's hearing, used a slew of arguments to dissuade Matsumoto from revoking Shkreli's bond, as she appeared inclined to do almost from the moment that she took the bench.
""I'm not making excuses for Mr. Shkreli,"" Brafman said. ""We had a long, painful discussion about this episode.""
""I'm angry at him too,"" the lawyer said.
Brafman said Shkreli never intended for his post to be taken seriously, noting that Shkreli had also written about using the hair to ""clone"" Clinton, and that he was dismayed to find out that people might believe otherwise.
""Stupid doesn't make you violent,"" Brafman said.
Brafman suggested however that Shkreli — a purported supporter of President Donald Trump with a long-standing animus to Clinton — was merely engaging in the sort of scathing political hyperbole that has become increasingly common in America. Brafman said that kind of speech, no matter how offensive, is constitutionally protected.
The lawyer also argued that Shkreli had been lashing out on social media in response to being demonized by the public in the past two years after raising the price of an anti-parasite drug by 5,000 percent in 2015.
Brafman offered to have Shkreli make a full-throated disavowal of this Clinton bounty online on Wednesday, to be willingly banned from all social media by the judge, and to generally behave appropriately from now on until he is sentenced.
He kept arguing his points for nearly 20 minutes after Matsumoto first said she would revoke Shkreli's bond, in an increasingly desperate effort to get the judge to change her mind.
In a letter to Matsumoto on Tuesday, Shkreli had written, ""I wanted to personally apologize to this Court and my lawyers for the aggravation that my recent postings have caused.""
""I understand now that some may have read my comments about Mrs. Clinton as threatening, when that was never my intention when making those comments,"" Shkreli wrote.
""I used poor judgment but never intended to cause alarm or promote any act of violence whatsoever,"" he wrote, adding that he had quickly amended his post to make clear he had just been joking.
Shkreli's lawyer Brafman, in his own letter to Matsumoto on Tuesday, had written, ""While we do not condone Mr. Shkreli's comment, his constitutionally protected political hyperbole does not rise to the level of making a 'danger to the community' when he is not and has never been considered to be a danger.""
Brafman said that Shkreli should not be jailed because he ""never intended any harm or violence.""
The lawyer disputed prosecutors' contention that comments Shkreli made online about Clinton and a journalist, Lauren Duca, constituted an escalating pattern of threats.
Brafman suggested that Shkreli was engaging in ""political hyperbole"" or ""satire"" in his comments about both women.
Brafman cited the fact that comedian Kathy Griffin was not prosecuted after she posted online a photograph of herself holding what appeared to be the bloody, severed head of Trump.
""Another example of political hyperbole is when President Donald Trump, as a candidate, caused a controversy last year by implying that 'Second Amendment people' could prevent former Secretary Clinton from abolishing their right to bear arms.""
Michael Bachner, a leading New York criminal defense lawyer, earlier Wednesday told CNBC he did not believe Shkreli should have his bail revoked.
""If he had made the comments about another author who wasn't Clinton, I don't think there would be a bail revocation hearing going on here,"" said Bachner.
Another top New York lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, earlier said that while Shkreli probably should be allowed to remain free on bail, ""I think the judge is probably at wit's end with respect to... his conduct.""
Matsumoto, during Shkreli's trial this summer, imposed a virtual gag order on him that barred him from talking about the case in public around the courthouse after he gave an impromptu press conference to reporters and called prosecutors in the case the ""junior varsity.""
Asked if he had ever seen a defendant in a criminal case who had been convicted make such a public spectacle of himself as Shkreli has done since early August, Lefcourt said, ""No.""
""He is just incapable of controlling himself,"" Lefcourt said.

 This tech IPO has everyone talking   
 3:07  PM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  01:13 
 It's a rather slow year for IPOs, but Thursday we'll see an IPO floated at the NYSE that is getting more than the usual amount of attention.
 The company is Social Capital Hedosophia, and they are planning a fairly healthy IPO of $600 million: 60 million shares at $10. (That's up from 50 million shares first indicated.). The company's shares rose 2.8 percent mid morning Thursday after it opened for trading.
Normally, of course, IPOs announce price ranges, say, from $9 to $11, not just one price of $10. Why is this just $10 with no range?
 Because the company has no assets, at least not yet. It is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a company that is being set up to invest in technology companies that are not yet public.
These SPACs are enjoying a banner year: more than 20 have gone public so far in 2017, the highest number since 2007, according to Renaissance Capital, a research firm that tracks IPOs and runs the Renaissance Capital IPO ETF (IPO), a basket of the most recent IPOs.
SPACs are based on a simple premise: a seasoned manager in an investment space (energy, tech, etc.) buys assets and assembles them in a portfolio for investors. They are sometimes referred to as ""blank check"" companies.

 Social Capital Hedosophia begins trading today   
 12:28  PM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  02:15 
 ""What you're buying is a management team with a lot of experience, which is very attractive to investors,"" Carolyn Saacke, chief operating officer for capital markets at the NYSE, told me. ""They usually have a lot of M&A experience in the companies and the industries they are coming from, so there's some faith they will be able to buy a company at a decent price.""
In the case of Social Capital, the CEO is Chamath Palihapitiya, one of the original members of the Facebook management team. Palihapitiya spoke at CNBC's Delivering Alpha conference on Tuesday.
Having an experienced manager buy companies for you sounds like a good idea, but there's a clear element of risk. The manager is essentially saying, ""Trust me, I can buy companies at a price that will make money for you.""
Still, it begs the question, why now? Why are SPACs suddenly such a popular investment vehicle?
The answer is twofold: it helps address the IPO logjam, and an ""out clause"" gives investors who are nervous about not knowing what they are buying a way to back out of the deal.
1) The IPO logjam. We've been talking about it all year: There are hundreds of companies waiting to go public that can't or won't in the current climate. There are more than 100 tech ""unicorns"" (those with valuations over $1 billion) seeking to go public alone. In the case of energy companies, they have trouble going public because the public wants nothing to do with energy companies with oil in the $40 range. In the case of tech, there is a huge ""valuation gap"" between the unicorns' private valuation and what the public is willing to pay for them.
2) The ""out clause."" The proceeds from the IPO are initially held in a trust account that can only be accessed to make the acquisitions. The SPAC has a time frame — usually two years or less — in which to make acquisitions. Once the acquisitions are made, the public stockholders can elect to have their shares redeemed for cash if they don't want to stay in the deal.
So the answer to ""why are SPACs so popular now?"" is that they help break the IPO logjam, while at the same time allowing investors an out in case they don't like what the manager is doing.
Still, why would anyone park a lot of money for up to two years and not know what they are ultimately investing in? Kathleen Smith of Renaissance Capital says to look at it from the perspective of a money manager: ""Say you have cash you need to put to work, and you don't have a good place to invest immediately. You put it to work in the SPAC, you are still collecting a management fee, and it's not going to go down because the money is invested in a trust. It's like a hedge for a hedge fund.""
Still, she is no fan of SPACs in general. The owners of SPACs argue that it is worth the cost to pay for the expertise, but Smith begs to differ: ""The people who make the money are the bankers who make a fee on the IPOs and the proxy statement telling holders what they have, the lawyers, and the exchanges. There is a lot of expensive friction in getting a company to the marketplace. It's not a straightforward way to raise capital. It's better to go directly to the marketplace and get the deal done, because there are a lot less fees.""
Smith also notes that the SPAC must include audited financials and a full description of the acquiring companies, essentially requiring the acquired company to go through much of the disclosure process as a full IPO.
There's another issue with SPACs, Smith points out: dilution. In the case of Social Capital, initial shareholders are getting 20 percent of the company at an insider price of $0.002 cent. That's not a typo: $0.002 cent. The public shareholders are getting the other 80 percent of the company for $10 a share.
That's a pretty sweet deal. A 20 percent finder's fee is ""a very typical situation for SPACs,"" David Menlow of IPOfinancial.com told me.
Do SPACs make money for investors? It's not a simple question, since the company can do nothing for more than a year before it makes any acquisitions. Menlow notes that ""Success has to be measured on a case-by-case basis.""
One success story Menlow points to is Hostess Brands, the maker of Twinkies and Ding Dongs. A SPAC, Gores Holdings, was created in 2015 and merged with Hostess in 2016, which was then a private company. The stock, which was trading in the high $9 range prior to the announcement, was in the $12 range by the time the deal closed in November of that year.
As for Social Capital and Mr. Palihapitiya, Smith notes that the central question for investors is, ""Can he buy unicorns or other tech companies at a bargain price, or even a fair price?""
Palihapitiya will appear at noon ET on ""Fast Money Halftime Report."" This is only the fifth SPAC IPO of the year for the NYSE, which earlier in the year modified its listing requirements to attract more SPAC listings.

 The bankers behind Snap's IPO totally botched the price, former Facebook exec says   
 1:42  PM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  02:11 
 Snap shareholders have felt the pain of its March IPO, as shares have tumbled more than 27 percent over the past 6 months, dipping below the public offering price.
 That could have been avoided if the IPO hadn't been mispriced, Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report"" on Thursday. 
""You have a bank, Morgan Stanley in that case, spending weeks and weeks with the company. They try to get the ground truth of what they think the company is worth,"" Palihapitiya said. ""It's priced at $17, it opens in the mid-$20s ... all the mutual funds are forced to sell because the price spikes. Clearly it was mispriced. ... All of that, in my opinion, is fundamentally unnecessary and entirely avoidable.""
 Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive, said Snap could have made a good candidate for his holding company. The founder and CEO of Social Capital ushered in the public offering of his company on Thursday. Shares of Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings rose more than 2 percent in their public debut. 
It's somewhat of an unusual IPO: The holding company will use the funds to acquire emerging private businesses that don't have the resources or business model to do an IPO themselves. Alongside tech stars such as former Twitter executive Adam Bain, it aims to be somewhat like a bleeding-edge version of Berkshire Hathaway. 
The right target could also stand alone under Palihapitiya's corporation, he said, but Social Capital would do the work of getting the company ready for public markets, while the management could focus on its product.
That would allow technical executives and ""thoughtful"" investors, like Palihapitiya, rather than bankers, to assess dynamic tech companies and determine what they are worth.
When the traditional IPO process fails, ""the only people that pay the price are the employees and the CEO,"" he said.
""And you're talking about an exceptionally creative team — a lot of really good people who should otherwise have been left to build the business,"" Palihapitiya said. ""There is a better way to price these IPOs.""

 Chamath Palihapitiya: Facebook and Google have become 'surveillance states'   
 6:32  PM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  01:55 
 Even though he was once an executive at Facebook, Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings, favors investing in Amazon instead, he told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report"" on Thursday. 
 President Donald Trump has been a critic of Amazon, tweeting his disdain for coverage from The Washington Post, which is a personal holding of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. But Palihapitiya said he thinks that Facebook and Google face more regulatory risk, given the many retailers that compete with Amazon.
""Amazon is a microscopic portion of global consumption today, so ultimately I think it has more room to grow before it invites regulatory overview,""  Palihapitiya said. ""On the other hand, Facebook and Google effectively are surveillance states. And they have so much personal, private information about so many citizens of so many countries."" 
 Google has already had a tussle with regulators in Europe, after the company was slapped with a record fine in one investigation.
""It's already beginning,"" Palihapitiya said. ""Because it's part and parcel to them realizing that there's too much power unbounded."" 
Palihapitiya noted that many big technology companies have seen their stocks soar, making it tempting to take gains. Palihapitiya's holding company, which also includes former Twitter executive Adam Bain, hit the public markets Thursday.
But Palihapitiya said he thinks investors should reframe the way they think about the long-term trajectories of the companies. 
For instance, Amazon is competing against Wal-Mart, which has acquired e-commerce companies like Jet.com and Bonobos. But with tools like Alexa, robots and cloud, Amazon's technology could lead it to victory over ""laggard competitors,""  Palihapitiya said. 
""It is competing against fundamentally impaired companies, including Wal-Mart, quite honestly,""  Palihapitiya said. ""That don't have the technical savvy, they don't have the capabilities, specialty retailers, an entire overhang of cost structure that [Amazon doesn't] have to deal with.""
Facebook, Google and Wal-Mart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 Facebook said its Messenger app now has 1.3 billion monthly users, up 30 percent in just over a year and rivaling the popularity of WhatsApp.
 The milestone, disclosed on Thursday, comes two months after WhatsApp, Facebook's other message service, said it was serving 1.3 billion users a month.
Facebook wants to generate more revenue from those services after warning that ad sales growth from its News Feed product will start to wane in the second half of this year.
 The company began testing Messenger ads two months ago. CEO  Mark Zuckerberg recently said he wanted the company to move even faster to get ads in front of Messenger users.
Facebook shares are up more than 40 percent this year, as Wall Street analysts expect its 2017 sales to rise 42 percent from a year earlier.
Facebook said in July 2016, that Messenger had 1 billion monthly users and updated that number in April to 1.2 billion.
 There are now 1.3B of you actively using Messenger every month. Thank you! We will continue to work hard to make our product better for you. pic.twitter.com/gjEgDXZfgg— David Marcus (@davidmarcus) September 14, 2017

 Judge sends Martin Shkreli to jail for Facebook post   
 10:53  AM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  00:45 
 Notorious ""pharma bro"" Martin Shkreli and former presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton have at least one thing in common: they both wanted to have other people to collect someone else's DNA.
 Eight years before this week's abrupt jailing of Shkreli for offering Facebook followers a $5,000 bounty for a sample of Clinton's hair, then-Secretary of State Clinton requested that American diplomats collect ""biometric information"" — such as DNA — from their foreign counterparts, classified documents show.
Those documents detailing a U.S. diplomatic spy effort, obtained in 2010 by Wikileaks, offer yet another bizarre twist to the already bizarre story of how convicted fraudster Shkreli had his $5 million release bond revoked Wednesday night.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton signs copies of her new book 'What Happened' during an event at a Barnes & Noble bookstore, Sept. 12, 2017, in New York City.
 Shkreli, 34, last week in a Facebook post, urged his 70,000 or so followers to grab some of Clinton's hair during her ongoing book tour — and said he would pay $5,000 per hair.
""I must confirm the sequences I already have,"" wrote Shkreli, who in posts a week before said he had Clinton's DNA and suggested he planned to clone her.
Shkreli later claimed the hair bounty offer was a joke. But unamused federal prosecutors asked a judge to revoke his $5 million bail, saying he was a danger to the community.
Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, agreed Wednesday, despite lengthy arguments by Shkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, that Shkreli was not violent and did not represent a danger to Clinton or anyone else.
 Shkreli now is incarcerated in a Brooklyn, New York, federal jail, where he will await a Jan. 16 sentencing for his conviction in August on securities fraud charges related to hedge funds and a drug company he ran.
Meanwhile, Clinton is continuing to promote her new book about the 2016 presidential election, ""What Happened.""
What happened in July 2009, according to the Wikileaks documents, is that a State Department cable issued under Clinton's name to American diplomats ""called for detailed biometric information 'on key [United Nation's] officials, to include undersecretaries, heads of specialised agencies and their chief advisers,"" The Guardian newspaper reported in 2010.

 Biometric information was also desired from permanent Security Council representatives from China, Russia, France and the United Kingdom, the newspaper reported.
""A parallel directive sent to diplomats in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi said biometric data included DNA, fingerprints and iris scans,"" the Guardian noted at that time.
Shkreli's lawyer declined to comment Thursday when CNBC asked about disclosures in the Wikileaks documents regarding Clinton and the State Department.

Chamath Palihapitiya speaking at the 2017 Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Sept. 12, 2017.
 The Street is buzzing with speculation over what company may be the target for Social Capital Hedosophia, which raised $600 million in an IPO today at the NYSE.
 Social Capital is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), set up to invest in technology companies that are not yet public. SPACs are based on a simple premise: investors are initially going in with a seasoned manager in an investment space (energy, tech, etc.) who will then have up to two years to buy one or more assets. The investors have the option of remaining in the investment or getting out and receiving their money back.
In this case the management team is led by Chamath Palihapitiya, one of the original members of Facebook's management team.
 The issue now: what will he buy?
Palihapitiya, in an interview earlier on CNBC, said he was looking for only one company to buy, so there is considerable speculation on what might be in his crosshairs.
He gave us a clue by identifying the rough size of a target: ""[T]hink about this as a merger of an entity that should be valued anywhere between $3 and call it $20 billion where that management stays in control...""
That is a wide range, but there are several tech ""unicorns"" that fall in the $3 billion to $20 billion range. Just in the $10 billion and below range there are several well-known names:
 Major tech ""unicorn"" valuations
 Dropbox  $10.3 b
Spotify     $8.5 b
Lyft           $7.5 b
Hulu         $5.8 b
SoFi          $4.3 b
Slack         $3.8 b
Credit Karma $3.5 b
SurveyMonkey $2.0 b
Source: Techcrunch
A bigger question: will he be able to buy anything at a price that would be considered attractive to his investors?
Kathleen Smith at Renaissance Capital cautions about jumping to conclusions, telling me, ""This deal doesn't say anything about the ability of Mr. Palihapitiya to raise money. Investors are parking money in the company. Once the company makes an acquisition, shareholders will have to analyze the deal and many may get out and be replaced by different investors.""
Still, investors seemed to like what Palihapitiya was selling: the IPO was increased to $600 million, from $500 million, and closed up 3.1 percent on its first day of trading, a strong opening, considering the company has no assets other than cash.
It's a good start, but we all know today's valuations can change very fast. In the tech world, two years is an eternity.

McGill University in Montreal, Canada.
 Facebook is opening its fourth artificial intelligence research lab, this one in Montreal. The move comes after Alphabet and Microsoft have invested in the AI research scene there.
 To lead the lab Facebook has tapped Joelle Pineau, an associate professor of Montreal's McGill University, whose academic papers on conversational agents and other topics through the years have been frequently cited. Pineau will retain her academic position while leading the Facebook lab, which should employ 10 people by the end of this month.
""I love that job, but there comes a time when you're up for a new challenge and finding out about a new way of doing research, Pineau said during a briefing on the news. ""Nowadays, so much machine learning research is happening in industry.""
 In addition to opening the lab, Facebook has committed about $5.75 million to support AI research at McGill, the University of Montreal, the Montreal Institute of Learning Algorithms and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, the company said in a Facebook blog post on Friday. Alphabet and Microsoft also have invested in AI at McGill and the University of Montreal.
The move comes a week after IBM said it would spend $240 million on a new AI lab in partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Facebook uses AI in several ways, including figuring out which posts to show users in the flagship app and filtering out spam in the Messenger chat app. The company is actively developing new ways to implement AI, including understanding speech commands from people using the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. 
""Our goal with artificial intelligence is to build systems that are better than people at perception — seeing, hearing, language and so on,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the company's F8 developer conference earlier this year.
As is the case with researchers working at Facebook's AI labs in Menlo Park, New York and Paris, researchers at the Montreal lab will be able to openly talk about their work and collaborate with people at other institutions. Pineau said that's one thing that attracted her to Facebook.

 The man who helped Trump use Facebook to get elected says algorithms can bring out our 'worst'   
 2:40  PM ET Fri, 15 Sept 2017 |  00:44 
 The technologist who ran Donald Trump's automated ad campaign on Facebook says ""unsupervised"" software can bring out the best and worst of humanity.
 Darren Bolding, chief technology officer of Cambridge Analytica, told the crowd at the third annual Internet Summit in San Francisco on Thursday that ""algorithms will find the worst in us if you let them go nuts.""
His comments came during an interview onstage with Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig in front of several hundred people gathered to hear him discuss the campaign. The interview was led by Matthew Prince, the CEO of internet service provider Cloudflare, which removed a white supremacist website from its network in the wake of Trump's comments after a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.
 Bolding — who worked at the Republican National Committee before joining Cambridge in January of 2017 —  said that the RNC used 15 ""issue models"" to target political ads at Facebook users during the 2016 U.S. election campaign.
When asked by Prince if he considered himself to be ""the man who got Trump elected,"" Bolding passed on taking a victory lap. 
""The reason Trump won was Trump himself,"" Bolding said, as a two-story, room-wide wall to his right was filled with the Twitter posts of people in the audience, beamed in real-time onto the massive concrete wall at Cloudflare's headquarters here.
""It's good for society to have shared context,"" Bolding said, essentially agreeing with a comment by Lessig, who was lamenting the fractured nature of American politics and society onstage.
""But people who have differences need to have them addressed,"" said Bolding, who answered ""no,"" when asked if he thought the technology he uses was 'ruining democracy.'
The event came as Facebook faces growing criticism to release more details on the ads it sent to users that it says were bought by Russians looking to influence U.S. voters.
The ads were targeted using the same automated Facebook system used by Cambridge Analytica, and for the same purpose -- to influence the U.S. presidential election.
That system can be gamed to find ad-targeting categories as benign as people who looking to buy a used car to those who may be predisposed to meeting racist anti-Semites, as a report by the public-interest journalism group ProPublica reported Thursday.
That report was addressed onstage at the internet conference at Cloudflare headquarters.
""It's not that [Facebook CEO] Mark Zuckerberg is interested in attacking Jews,"" said Lessig, the Harvard law professor, during the onstage discussion. ""It's that his technology...allows for the feeding of this micro-targeting.""
That technology reinforces the tendency people have to seek out those with similar views, which results in consumers of social media content living in ""niche, bizarre worlds,"" Lessing said. 
The age of the internet ""is the best and worst of all possible times."" he said.

 Facebook has come under fire in recent weeks for advertising practices that allowed Russian trolls to buy space and enabled advertisers to target users based on anti-Semitic search terms. 
 The solution to troubling internet ads, according to one author and professor, may be to take cues from TV ads. 
""When you buy advertising on a TV network, you have to disclose who paid for it and where it's coming from,"" said Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the University of Southern California's Annenberg Innovation Lab, on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" Monday.
 Facebook and Google, on the other hand, are protected by a safe harbor law that allows advertisers to remain anonymous, Taplin said. 
The FCC is tasked with regulation of TV ads -- demanding such transparency as in-ad payment disclosures -- but internet ads fall under the purview of the FTC. 
""We've had a very lax regulatory regime, but my guess is they will have to start doing this,"" Taplin said. ""It will lead to more regulation and you're right that the Europeans are starting that.""
The European Union earlier this month introduced guidelines for internet giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter to more quickly remove illegal content from their sites. The recommendations aren't legally binding, but lawmakers have said more legislation could follow.

 });On a muggy, late spring evening, Tuan Pham awoke to the police storming his house in Hanoi, Vietnam.
They marched him to a police station and made their demand: Hand over your Facebook password. Mr. Tuan, a computer engineer, had recently written a poem on the social network called ''Mother's Lullaby,'' which criticized how the communist country was run.
One line read, ''One century has passed, we are still poor and hungry, do you ask why?''
 Mr. Tuan's arrest came just weeks after Facebook offered a major olive branch to Vietnam's government. Facebook's head of global policy management, Monika Bickert, met with a top Vietnamese official in April and pledged to remove information from the social network that violated the country's laws.
While Facebook said its policies in Vietnam have not changed, and it has a consistent process for governments to report illegal content, the Vietnamese government was specific. The social network, they have said, had agreed to help create a new communications channel with the government to prioritize Hanoi's requests and remove what the regime considered inaccurate posts about senior leaders.

Facebook founder and chief Mark Zuckerberg (C) speaks to German Chief of Staff Peter Altmaier (R) at the so-called 'Facebook Innovation Hub' in Berlin on February 25, 2016.
 Populous, developing countries like Vietnam are where the company is looking to add its next billion customers -- and to bolster its ad business. Facebook's promise to Vietnam helped the social media giant placate a government that had called on local companies not to advertise on foreign sites like Facebook, and it remains a major marketing channel for businesses there.
The diplomatic game that unfolded in Vietnam has become increasingly common for Facebook. The internet is Balkanizing, and the world's largest tech companies have had to dispatch envoys to, in effect, contain the damage such divisions pose to their ambitions.
The internet has long had a reputation of being an anything-goes place that only a few nations have tried to tame -- China in particular. But in recent years, events as varied as the Arab Spring, elections in France and confusion in Indonesia over the religion of the country's president have awakened governments to how they have lost some control over online speech, commerce and politics on their home turf.
Even in the United States, tech giants are facing heightened scrutiny from the government. Facebook recently cooperated with investigators for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the American presidential election. In recent weeks, politicians on the left and the right have also spoken out about the excess power of America's largest tech companies.
As nations try to grab back power online, a clash is brewing between governments and companies. Some of the biggest companies in the world -- Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba among them -- are finding they need to play by an entirely new set of rules on the once-anarchic internet.
And it's not just one new set of rules. According to a review by The New York Times, more than 50 countries have passed laws over the last five years to gain greater control over how their people use the web.
''Ultimately, it's a grand power struggle,'' said David Reed, an early pioneer of the internet and a former professor at the M.I.T. Media Lab. ''Governments started waking up as soon as a significant part of their powers of communication of any sort started being invaded by companies.''
Facebook encapsulates the reasons for the internet's fragmentation -- and increasingly, its consequences.
The company has become so far-reaching that more than two billion people -- about a quarter of the world's population -- now use Facebook each month. Internet users (excluding China) spend one in five minutes online within the Facebook universe, according to comScore, a research firm. And Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, wants that dominance to grow.

But politicians have struck back. China, which blocked Facebook in 2009, has resisted Mr. Zuckerberg's efforts to get the social network back into the country. In Europe, officials have repudiated Facebook's attempts to gather data from its messaging apps and third-party websites.
The Silicon Valley giant's tussle with the fracturing internet is poised to escalate. Facebook has now reached almost everyone who already has some form of internet access, excluding China. Capturing those last users -- including in Asian nations like Vietnam and African countries like Kenya -- may involve more government roadblocks.
''We understand that and accept that our ideals are not everyone's,'' said Elliot Schrage, Facebook's vice president of communications and public policy. ''But when you look at the data and truly listen to the people around the world who rely on our service, it's clear that we do a much better job of bringing people together than polarizing them.''
Friending China
By mid-2016, a yearslong campaign by Facebook to get into China -- the world's biggest internet market -- appeared to be sputtering.
Mr. Zuckerberg had wined and dined Chinese politicians, publicly showed off his newly acquired Chinese-language skills -- a moment that set the internet abuzz -- and talked with a potential Chinese partner about pushing the social network into the market, according to a person familiar with the talks who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential.
At a White House dinner in 2015, Mr. Zuckerberg had even asked the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, whether Mr. Xi might offer a Chinese name for his soon-to-be-born first child -- usually a privilege reserved for older relatives, or sometimes a fortune teller. Mr. Xi declined, according to a person briefed on the matter.
But all those efforts flopped, foiling Facebook's attempts to crack one of the most isolated pockets of the internet.
China has blocked Facebook and Twitter since mid-2009, after an outbreak of ethnic rioting in the western part of the country. In recent years, similar barriers have gone up for Google services and other apps, like Line and Instagram.
Even if Facebook found a way to enter China now, it would not guarantee financial success. Today, the overwhelming majority of Chinese citizens use local online services like Qihoo 360 and Sina Weibo. No American-made apps rank among China's 50 most popular services, according to SAMPi, a market research firm.
Chinese tech officials said that although many in the government are open to the idea of Facebook releasing products in China, there is resistance among leaders in the standing committee of the country's Politburo, its top decision-making body.
In 2016, Facebook took tentative steps toward embracing China's censorship policies. That summer, Facebook developed a tool that could suppress posts in certain geographic areas, The Times reported last year. The idea was that it would help the company get into China by enabling Facebook or a local partner to censor content according to Beijing's demands. The tool was not deployed.
In another push last year, Mr. Zuckerberg spent time at a conference in Beijing that is a standard on the China government relations tour. Using his characteristic brand of diplomacy -- the Facebook status update -- he posted a photo of himself running in Tiananmen Square on a dangerously smoggy day. The photo drew derision on Twitter, and concerns from Chinese about Mr. Zuckerberg's health.
For all the courtship, things never quite worked out.
''There's an interest on both sides of the dance, so some kind of product can be introduced,'' said Kai-Fu Lee, the former head of Google in China who now runs a venture-capital firm in Beijing. ''But what Facebook wants is impossible, and what they can have may not be very meaningful.''
This spring, Facebook tried a different tactic: testing the waters in China without telling anyone. The company authorized the release of a photo-sharing app there that does not bear its name, and experimented by linking it to a Chinese social network called WeChat.
One factor driving Mr. Zuckerberg may be the brisk ad business that Facebook does from its Hong Kong offices, where the company helps Chinese companies -- and the government's own propaganda organs -- spread their messages. In fact, the scale of the Chinese government's use of Facebook to communicate abroad offers a notable sign of Beijing's understanding of Facebook's power to mold public opinion.
Chinese state media outlets have used ad buys to spread propaganda around key diplomatic events. Its stodgy state-run television station and the party mouthpiece newspaper each have far more Facebook ''likes'' than popular Western news brands like CNN and Fox News, a likely indication of big ad buys.
To attract more ad spending, Facebook set up one page to show China's state broadcaster, CCTV, how to promote on the platform, according to a person familiar with the matter. Dedicated to Mr. Xi's international trips, the page is still regularly updated by CCTV, and has 2.7 million likes. During the 2015 trip when Mr. Xi met Mr. Zuckerberg, CCTV used the channel to spread positive stories. One post was titled ''Xi's UN address wins warm applause.''
Fittingly, Mr. Zuckerberg's eagerness and China's reluctance can be tracked on Facebook.
During Mr. Xi's 2015 trip to America, Mr. Zuckerberg posted about how the visit offered him his first chance to speak a foreign language with a world leader. The post got more than a half million likes, including from Chinese state media (despite the national ban). But on Mr. Xi's propaganda page, Mr. Zuckerberg got only one mention -- in a list of the many tech executives who met the Chinese president.
Europe's privacy pushback
Last summer, emails winged back and forth between members of Facebook's global policy team. They were finalizing plans, more than two years in the making, for WhatsApp, the messaging app Facebook had bought in 2014, to start sharing data on its one billion users with its new parent company. The company planned to use the data to tailor ads on Facebook's other services and to stop spam on WhatsApp.
A big issue: how to win over wary regulators around the world.
Despite all that planning, Facebook was hit by a major backlash. A month after the new data-sharing deal started in August 2016, German privacy officials ordered WhatsApp to stop passing data on its 36 million local users to Facebook, claiming people did not have enough say over how it would be used. The British privacy watchdog soon followed.
By late October, all 28 of Europe's national data-protection authorities jointly called on Facebook to stop the practice. Facebook quietly mothballed its plans in Europe. It has continued to collect people's information elsewhere, including the United States.
''There's a growing awareness that people's data is controlled by large American actors,'' said Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin, France's privacy regulator. ''These actors now know that times have changed.''
Facebook's retreat shows how Europe is effectively employing regulations -- including tough privacy rules -- to control how parts of the internet are run.

 The goal of European regulators, officials said, is to give users greater control over the data from social media posts, online searches and purchases that Facebook and other tech giants rely on to monitor our online habits.
As a tech company whose ad business requires harvesting digital information, Facebook has often underestimated the deep emotions that European officials and citizens have tied into the collection of such details. That dates back to the time of the Cold War, when many Europeans were routinely monitored by secret police.
Now, regulators from Colombia to Japan are often mimicking Europe's stance on digital privacy. ''It's only natural European regulators would be at the forefront,'' said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. ''It reflects the importance they've attached to the privacy agenda.''
In interviews, Facebook denied it has played fast and loose with users' online information and said it complies with national rules wherever it operates. It questioned whether Europe's position has been effective in protecting individuals' privacy at a time when the region continues to fall behind the United States and China in all things digital.
Still, the company said it respected Europe's stance on data protection, particularly in Germany, where many citizens have long memories of government surveillance.
''There's no doubt the German government is a strong voice inside the European community,'' said Richard Allan, Facebook's head of public policy in Europe. ''We find their directness pretty helpful.''
Europe has the law on its side when dictating global privacy. Facebook's non-North American users, roughly 1.8 billion people, are primarily overseen by Ireland's privacy regulator because the company's international headquarters is in Dublin, mostly for tax reasons. In 2012, Facebook was forced to alter its global privacy settings -- including those in the United States -- after Ireland's data protection watchdog found problems while auditing the company's operations there.
Three years later, Europe's highest court also threw out a 15-year-old data-sharing agreement between the region and the United States following a complaint that Facebook had not sufficiently protected Europeans' data when it was transferred across the Atlantic. The company denies any wrongdoing.
And on Sept. 12, Spain's privacy agency fined the company 1.2 million euros for not giving people sufficient control over their data when Facebook collected it from third-party websites. Watchdogs in Germany, the Netherlands and elsewhere are conducting similar investigations. Facebook is appealing the Spanish ruling.
''Facebook simply can't stick to a one-size-fits-all product around the world,'' said Max Schrems, an Austrian lawyer who has been a Facebook critic after filing the case that eventually overturned the 15-year-old data deal.
Potentially more worrying for Facebook is how Europe's view of privacy is being exported. Countries from Brazil to Malaysia, which are crucial to Facebook's growth, have incorporated many of Europe's tough privacy rules into their legislation.
''We regard the European directives as best practice,'' said Pansy Tlakula, chairwoman of South Africa's Information Regulator, the country's data protection agency. South Africa has gone so far as to copy whole sections, almost word-for-word, from Europe's rule book.
The play for Kenya
Blocked in China and troubled by regulators in Europe, Facebook is trying to become ''the internet'' in Africa. Helping get people online, subsidizing access, and trying to launch satellites to beam the internet down to the markets it covets, Facebook has become a dominant force on a continent rapidly getting online.
But that has given it a power that has made some in Africa uncomfortable.
Some countries have blocked access, and outsiders have complained Facebook could squelch rival online business initiatives. Its competition with other internet companies from the United States and China has drawn comparisons to a bygone era of colonialism.
For Kenyans like Phyl Cherop, 33, an entrepreneur in Nairobi, online life is already dominated by the social network. She abandoned her bricks-and-mortar store in a middle-class part of the city in 2015 to sell on Facebook and WhatsApp.
''I gave it up because people just didn't come anymore,'' said Ms. Cherop, who sells items like designer dresses and school textbooks. She added that a stand-alone website would not have the same reach. ''I prefer using Facebook because that's where my customers are. The first thing people want to do when they buy a smartphone is to open a Facebook account.''
As Facebook hunts for more users, the company's aspirations have shifted to emerging economies where people like Ms. Cherop live. Less than 50 percent of Africa's population has internet connectivity, and regulation is often rudimentary.
Since Facebook entered Africa about a decade ago, it has become the region's dominant tech platform. Some 170 million people -- more than two thirds of all internet users from South Africa to Senegal -- use it, according Facebook's statistics. That is up 40 percent since 2015.
The company has struck partnerships with local carriers to offer basic internet services -- centered on those offered by Facebook -- for free. It has built a pared-down version of its social network to run on the cheaper, less powerful phones that are prevalent there.
Facebook is also investing tens of millions of dollars alongside telecom operators to build a 500-mile fiber-optic internet connection in rural Uganda. In total, it is working with about 30 regional governments on digital projects.

''We want to bring connectivity to the world,'' said Jay Parikh, a Facebook vice president for engineering who oversees the company's plans to use drones, satellites and other technology to connect the developing world.
Facebook is racing to gain the advantage in Africa over rivals like Google and Chinese players including Tencent, in a 21st century version of the ''Scramble for Africa.'' Google has built fiber internet networks in Uganda and Ghana. Tencent has released WeChat, its popular messaging and e-commerce app, in South Africa.
Facebook has already hit some bumps in its African push. Chad blocked access to Facebook and other sites during elections or political protests. Uganda also took legal action in Irish courts to force the social network to name an anonymous blogger who had been critical of the government. Those efforts failed.
In Kenya, one of Africa's most connected countries, there has been less pushback.
Facebook expanded its efforts in the country of 48 million in 2014. It teamed up with Airtel Africa, a mobile operator, to roll out Facebook's Free Basics -- a no-fee version of the social network, with access to certain news, health, job and other services there and in more than 20 other countries worldwide. In Kenya, the average person has a budget of just 30 cents a day to spend on internet access.
Free Basics now lets Kenyans use Facebook and its Messenger service at no cost, as well as read news from a Kenyan newspaper and view information about public health programs. Joe Mucheru, Kenya's tech minister, said it at least gives his countrymen a degree of internet access.
Still, Facebook's plans have not always worked out. Many Kenyans with access to Free Basics rely on it only as a backup when their existing smartphone credit runs out.
''Free Basics? I don't really use it that often,'' said Victor Odinga, 27, an accountant in downtown Nairobi. ''No one wants to be seen as someone who can't afford to get online.''

Consumers and Gender Equality Commissioner Vera Jourová.
 One of the European Union's leading regulators is making a house call to Silicon Valley this week. Her agenda: A series of meetings with the likes of Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg to press the tech industry on privacy, hate speech and consumer protection.
The visit beginning today by Věra Jourová, the EU commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality, comes at a time when Brussels increasingly is the cop on the beat overseeing the U.S. tech industry, which often has escaped the strongest regulation from its own government in Washington, D.C.
At the top of Jourová's list is the future of a transatlantic trade pact that allows tech companies to store Europeans' data in the United States. The agreement, called the Privacy Shield, exists to bridge the gap between the U.S. and EU governments' different approaches to privacy protection — and the deal is  up for its first annual review this week.
 The likes of Facebook, Google and Microsoft stress the agreement is  essential for the day-to-day functions of their products and services, as have top White House officials. Together, they fought to secure its implementation beginning in 2015, after concerns about the U.S. government's lax privacy laws led an EU court to invalidate their last data-transfer pact.
For her part, Jourová exited the meeting with key Trump administration officials saying she ""had a very strong feeling that we are on one page, the same page, as for the goals"" of the Privacy Shield. But she did express a few doubts — including the fact that the U.S. government had yet to appoint an ombudsman for the trade agreement. That official is supposed to handle complaints from EU citizens who fear their data has been handled inappropriately by the United States.
""I'm sure we will insist on having people in those places as soon as possible,"" she said of a forthcoming EU report on implementation.

As part of a review of the Privacy Shield, Jourová's meetings will take her to Apple, Facebook, Google and Palantir, she told Recode. With web companies in particular, they'll also hear an earful about the EU's work to crack down on everything from copyright infringement to hate speech.
To that end, the Commission is expected to produce a policy paper in September studying those issues as well as other forms of illegal content, including terrorist messaging and child pornography. The process, Jourová said, would determine ""whether we will come with more strict rules, or whether we will continue working with the IT sector.""
On hate speech, in particular, the EU has already pressed Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Google to add more staff and improve their technology so they can spot offending content identified by European governments and take it down in the course of 24 hours. Over the past year, those companies have sped up their response times, a recent EU report has found —  though Twitter still has faced criticism for being too slow.
Absent more improvements, Jourová stressed that the EU could seek binding regulation of hate speech — rules that would apply beyond the four companies currently working with Brussels on the issue.
""We made clear that if we do not see better action we will have to come with maybe harder solutions in the EU — hard in the [sense] of regulation,"" she said.

Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg speaks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
 Conditions may soon be right for Facebook to break into the Chinese market, and Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant is already taking strategic steps to do so, Mizuho said Monday.
 ""During our recent China trip, our meetings with various industry contacts indicated that FB could have a realistic opportunity for entering China next year,"" James Lee, managing director, Americas research, and Wei Fang, vice president, research, said in a report. 
Facebook declined to comment. Shares traded about 1 percent higher midday Tuesday, outperforming the broader U.S. stock market's mild gains. 
 The report pointed out that Beijing tends to lessen its media scrutiny during an administration's second term, and Facebook may have ""an opening"" after Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his second five-year term in November. 
""For example, Google successfully renewed its ICP license [for operating in China] during the second term of the prior President Hu Jintao,"" the Mizuho report said. ""We believe the recent approvals of MNC internet companies such as LinkedIn and Airbnb are signs China is more open to internet companies that can help Chinese companies gain global recognition through advertising or facilitate economic growth through travel.""
Facebook hit 2 billion monthly active users in the second quarter, but it has been blocked in mainland China for at least 8 years. Meanwhile, internet penetration in China is growing and reached 53.2 percent in 2016, with 731 million users, according to a January report from the China Internet Network Information Center. 
The China Internet Information Center and Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology did not respond to emailed requests for comment Tuesday evening Beijing time.
Internet's growing role in Chinese media consumption

In the last few months, Facebook has taken more steps in apparent preparation for operations in China. 
The company recently hired a Beijing-based government relations executive whose experience includes helping LinkedIn China secure a license in the country, the Mizuho analysts pointed out. 
Although the report didn't name a specific individual, William Shuai is listed on LinkedIn as ""Senior Manager of Government Relations"" for Facebook in Beijing, since September. The profile shows Shuai was director of government relations for LinkedIn China for more than three years, and government relations manager at Chinese internet giant Baidu for nearly three years before that. 
Shuai did not immediately respond to a LinkedIn message sent Tuesday evening Beijing time. Facebook said the company doesn't comment on personnel. 
The company is also looking for an office space in Shanghai,  The New York Times reported earlier this month, citing two people familiar with the matter. The news followed Facebook's failure to establish a location in Beijing when it received a three-month permit to do so in late 2015.
""We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country in different ways,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC that repeated the comment to the Times.
The social media company already generates more than $1 billion a year, or about 4 percent of total revenues, from Chinese advertisers, the Mizuho researchers estimated, citing checks with advertising agencies.
""The Chinese government has been pushing for globalization of Chinese brands so what FB does for Chinese advertisers is also strategic in order to get the license into China,"" the report said.
To be sure, it is unclear whether Facebook can crack the massive mainland Chinese market. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has unsuccessfully courted Beijing for years, while local social media platforms have even disrupted each other within China. 
Facebook's foray into China may also look different from how it operates in the West.
""We believe the business will initially be localized and connect only Chinese users. As for the products, we believe that either Instagram or VR are the most likely,"" the report said.

 Hurricane Maria batters Caribbean   
 9:50  AM ET Tue, 19 Sept 2017 |  00:58 
 Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit used Facebook in the early hours of Tuesday morning to describe the ""mind-boggling"" real-time impact of Hurricane Maria.
 ""We have lost all that money can buy,"" he said at around 01:24 a.m. local time on Tuesday.
""My greatest fear for the morning is that we will wake to news of serious physical injury and possible deaths as a result of likely landslides triggered by persistent rains,"" Skerrit said, shortly after providing details of his own rescue.
 On Monday evening and in the early hours of Tuesday, Skerrit posted live updates on social media as his own roof was torn from his home, saying he was ""at the complete mercy of the hurricane.""
 'Extremely dangerous'
 Maria is estimated to be moving along a similar track to that of Irma – the hurricane that devastated the same region earlier this month.
It currently has maximum sustained winds of around 160 miles per hour and while it was temporarily downgraded to a Category 4 storm by forecasters Tuesday morning, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said it had since regained Category 5 strength as it approached the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
""Maria is forecast to remain an extremely dangerous Category 4 or 5 hurricane while it approaches the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico,"" the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday morning.
Dominica, a heavily forested former British colony home to 72,000 people, lies in the eastern Caribbean about halfway between the French islands of Guadeloupe, to the north, and Martinique, to the south.
""I am honestly not preoccupied with physical damage at this time, because it is devastating ... Indeed, mind boggling. My focus now is in rescuing the trapped and securing medical assistance for the injured,"" Skerrit said, before calling on the international community to come to his country's aid.""We will need help, my friend, we will need help of all kinds,"" he added.
 Harvey, Irma, Jose, Maria
 In 2014, 31 people were killed and more than 360 homes were destroyed in Dominica by Tropical Storm Erika. Skerrit said at the time that the devastation caused could set the country back decades.
Maria marks the 13th named Atlantic storm of the year, the seventh hurricane so far this season and the fourth major hurricane — defined as Category 3 or higher — following Harvey, Irma and Jose, the NHC said. Those numbers are all slightly above average for a typical season, which is only about half the way through for 2017.

 Experts weigh in on whether Facebook ads should face regulation   
 3:32  PM ET Mon, 18 Sept 2017 |  02:42 
 Facebook found itself embroiled in a scandal when ProPublica discovered last week companies could place their ads in front of users who were most likely to identify as ""Jew haters"" and be interested in ""how to burn Jews"" based on their Facebook behavior. The categories were created by Facebook's automated system, according to the publication.
In addition, Facebook will be adding more human reviewers to oversee its automated advertising processes. The company temporarily blocked all ad-targeting terms after the ProPublica story but will re-add 5,000 approved categories, such as nurse or teacher. It also is working on a way for users to report any misuses of ads that go against Facebook's standards. 
""Seeing those words made me disgusted and disappointed — disgusted by these sentiments and disappointed that our systems allowed this,"" Sandberg wrote. ""Hate has no place on Facebook — and as a Jew, as a mother, and as a human being, I know the damage that can come from hate. The fact that hateful terms were even offered as options was totally inappropriate and a fail on our part.""

Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017.
 Facebook will lease all of the office space in a skyscraper under construction in downtown San Francisco, a new report says, as the company looks beyond its Silicon Valley home to house its fast-growing workforce.
 Facebook has leased 436,000 square feet at 181 Fremont St., which represents the city's largest office lease in the last three years, the San Francisco Business Times reported. It could house between 2,000 and 3,000 employees, and will be Facebook's first office in the city, which is about 35 miles north of its Menlo Park headquarters.
The company paid ""around $80 per square foot,"" or roughly $35 million, to lease the commercial space in the building, which will be the city's third-tallest when it's completed later this year, the report said.
 Employees of Facebook's Instagram unit will be among the first to move into the San Francisco skyscraper, the city's first property in the city, according to the report, which you can read here.
The property is located about a block from Salesforce Tower, the new home of software company Salesforce, which will be the tallest building in San Francisco once it's finished.
That will put technology companies at the center of the city's current office construction boom, which is rapidly remaking its skyline.
Facebook said in August it had just over 20,600 employees as of June 30, up more than 40 percent from a year earlier.
In July, Facebook unveiled plans to build a corporate campus on the 56-acre Menlo Science & Technology Park it bought in 2015 near its current headquarters.
An email sent to Facebook seeking comment on the lease wasn't immediately returned.

Martin Shkreli walking to court, June 29, 2017.
 Court records indicate that a psychiatric examination was sought for ""pharma bro"" Martin Shkreli after he was jailed last week for offering a bizarre cash bounty for some of Hillary Clinton's hair.
 The motion for Shkreli's psychiatric examination was filed in recent days in Brooklyn, New York, federal court, records for his criminal case there indicate.
Although the motion is not visible to public inspection, other records that are public refer to it.

 Martin Shkreli ordered to jail   
 3:59  PM ET Thu, 14 Sept 2017 |  00:32 
 But because the motion is not public, it is not known who requested the exam for the eccentric, disgraced pharmaceutical executive, or why it was sought.
However, an online court database reveals that Judge Kiyo Matsumoto issued an order on the motion on Tuesday. Records do not indicate what Matsumoto ordered.
 In opening arguments at Shkreli's trial on fraud charges this past summer, which Matsumoto presided over, his own lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told jurors, ""Maybe he's just nuts, but that doesn't make him guilty.""
""Will you find him strange? Yes. Will you find him weird? Yes!"" Brafman also said at the time about his client, who has a history of erratic behavior.
During Shkreli's trial, a former board member of one of Shkreli's drug companies testified that Shkreli had confided that he had suffered from depression, and took prescription medication for that condition.
The board member, Steven Richardson, also testified that he was not aware, as Shkreli's other lawyer Marc Agnifilo had suggested in questioning, that Shkreli on occasion ""couldn't bring himself to leave his house.""
The psychiatric exam motion came six days after an angry Matsumoto revoked Shkreli's $5 million release bond because of a $5,000 bounty he offered to Facebook followers who grabbed samples of hair from former Secretary of State Clinton and gave them to him.
 The judge agreed with prosecutors that Shkreli, who claimed the offer was a satirical joke gone bad, was a threat to the public because of both that bounty and because of other online posts he wrote disclosing his intent to ""f---"" two women after his trial ended.
Since then, Shkreli, 34, has been in jail at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, awaiting sentencing in January for his conviction on securities fraud charges.
His lawyer Brafman on Monday filed a motion asking that Matsumoto release restrictions on an E-Trade brokerage account that was securing Shkreli's $5 million release bond. Matsumoto has yet to rule on that motion.
CNBC has reached out to Brafman for comment on the psychiatric exam motion.
John Marzulli, spokesman for the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, which prosecuted Shkreli, declined to comment Wednesday.
During Shkreli's trial it was revealed that a former employee of his hedge funds once had referred to him as ""mentally unstable"" in an online chat she had with an executive at the fund.
The ex-employee, Caroline Stewart, testified that she had believed Shkreli was mentally unstable because ""in my opinion it's crazy to lie so much, particularly about things that are easily uncovered.""
Stewart also testified that Shkreli was ""deeply depressed"" in February 2011 after his hedge fund effectively ""imploded"" and was left owing $10 million to Merrill Lynch from a failed short sale of stock.
Other testimony and evidence at Shkreli's trial showed him repeatedly lying to hedge fund investors about his performance managing their money, and then scrambling to pay them back for their lost money with cash and stock from a drug company he founded, Retrophin.
Shkreli was convicted in early August of three securities fraud counts and acquitted of five other charges.

A woman looks over a pair of pants at a consignment shop in Palm Beach, Fl.
 Melissa Baxter started working in the thrift store industry as a teen and fell in love with the business. At 20, she bought a small consignment shop in the Atlanta suburbs.
Now 35, and the owner of Back by Popular Demand consignment shops in Linburn and Marietta, Georgia, she has to adapt faster than ever as e-commerce websites like thredUP and luxury re-seller The RealReal make it easier to buy online.
 For traditional, physical stores with less than $1 million in annual sales, resources like venture capital funding aren't typically an option. That's led owners to use strategies such as holding merchandise shows using Facebook's live streaming feature, and stylist services to bring in revenue.
More from USA Today:Facebook finds Russian ads that sought to sow division during U.S. electionElection hacking suit over Georgia race could be sign of what's to come'U.S. spies slept' while Russia elected Trump, Russian politician says
""We have to just be more creative. We have to use what's at our fingertips,"" said Baxter whose business also includes what she calls ""Prom Headquarters"" a portion of her Linburn location that sells prom dresses from size zero to 28. ""Most of us have active Facebook followings, we have active Instagram followings. And it's really instantaneous.""  As traditional mainstream retail struggles and stores such as Gap and J.C. Penney close stores, the consignment clothing and accessory market continues to grow. thredUP's annual report, followed by the industry, forecasts a $33 billion resale apparel market, both in stores and on websites, by 2021. That's up from $18 billion in 2016.
""People don't realize how much online selling brick and mortars do,"" said Adele Meyer, who has overseen the National Association of Reseller and Thrift Stores for more than two decades. ""Now, the newest trend is Facebook Live sales.""  Supply doesn't seem to be running out. The average American woman doesn't wear 60% of items in her closet, or about $220 billion in potential inventory, according to Fung Global Retail Tech, a consulting firm.
The resale market is resilient in the face of direct online selling sites like eBay and Letigo because consignment shops take the time to assess the quality of the merchandise before they price and sell it. Most people think their item is worth more than it is, especially in apparel, Meyer said.  For Vena Holden, owner of Selective Seconds in Greenwood, Indiana, growing means holding events on Facebook Live and even taking customers on overnight bus tours to other consignment shop outlets.
Holden, 58, has run her shop for 20 years and regularly takes customers on overnight bus tours of other consignment shops. She recently began holding live shows on Facebook.  ""I believe it's going to work, at least temporarily,"" Holden said.
ThredUp, with about 1,000 employees, estimates it will sell 10 million items this year, putting it on track to double for the fourth year in a row. This year it opened stores targeting cities where it has a concentration of online customers in San Marcos and Austin, Texas and a third in Walnut Creek, California. CEO James Reinhart says the company may open more.
""You're still looking at 10, 15, 20 years where you're still going to sell more stuff offline than you are online,"" Reinhart said. ""So, as a practical matter, it was 'we should have stores because that's where customers buy.'""
The RealReal CEO Julie Wainwright says her company, which sells items that range from $45 M. Missoni leggings to a $40,000 Hermes bag and even has rugs as high as $200,000 apiece decided to open physical stores after the success of a temporary, or pop-up, shop had $2 million in sales over an 18-day period. The company, with 950 employees, is on track to reach $500 million in sales this year, she said.  ""We found that the pop-up stores helped people think about us differently. It was an exercise in branding,"" she said. The RealReal employs about 50 experts, 35 of which are gemologists. Watchmakers, a curator that worked at Sotheby's and other experts make up the rest. Wainwright said. To further involve customers with the brand, The RealReal plans classes on how items are priced.  Jennifer Mann Hillman, a former marketing executive for retailers like Estee Lauder, and business partner costume designer Lisa Eisler, were going through clothes that were too small for their daughters. They decided they had too many things and both were interested in philanthropy. Hillman had worked closely with the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Something clicked.
Last month, they opened the Los Angeles-based website LuxAnthropy , which partners with charities to donate a portion of sales.  ""We thought 'there's got to be someplace where we can sell things and make money with our items and have some part of it donated to a charity that we love,' and we looked around and there really wasn't anything like it,"" Mann Hillman said.  In its first month, the business has accumulated more than 2,000 pieces from Hollywood insiders and wealthy business people. By partnering with charities such as Los Angeles Children's Hospital and housing provider Help USA, charities see LuxAnthropy as ``essentially creating a new revenue stream,"" Hillman said. ""We've had such a remarkable response,"" Eisler said.

 Facebook on Thursday is announcing updates to its Messenger chat app that make it more helpful during conversations. The biggest addition: Messenger will start giving you brief answers that you can tap in the app to easily respond to messages.
 For example, if a friend asks you if she can borrow your camping gear, you'll see suggestions like ""Of course!"" and ""Definitely!"" Tap on one of those to send a response, and you'll save yourself the time and energy of typing out an answer yourself. 
The answers come courtesy of M, Facebook's virtual assistant. Facebook initially let a small group of users chat directly with M over Messenger in the past, but the company ultimately changed directions and started incorporating it into chats that people have with their contacts, and only at certain appropriate times.
 Like other Facebook app components, such as automatically generated captions for video ads, the M reply buttons are created using artificial intelligence — Facebook isn't actually running a contact center full of people who are following your Messenger conversations and thinking up possible answers for you on the fly. (At a high level, the system checks to see if a quick reply will be valuable in response to an incoming message, then figures out which possible replies would work, and finally makes its final suggestions based on your personal writing style.)
Facebook isn't first to come up with this concept. Alphabet's Google started adding it to widely used apps first. While this is the first time ""quick replies"" are coming to a Facebook service, Google's ""smart reply"" feature has appeared in the Allo messaging app, Inbox by Gmail, Android Wear, and the Gmail mobile app.
Microsoft-owned LinkedIn has also brought automatically generated replies into its messaging feature. Some companies have experimented with the idea in the world of enterprise software, specifically in the domain of customer service.
The difference with Facebook's move is that Messenger is massively popular, with 1.3 billion monthly active users. If Google's expanding use of the technology for messaging and email is any indicator, then the feature will also pick up adoption in Messenger, and it could end up in Instagram and WhatsApp as well.
In addition to quick replies, Messenger's M assistant will also start suggesting animated GIFs to share in conversations, and when you're talking about movies, M will also begin suggesting you open the Fandango chat extension to watch trailers, check showtimes and buy tickets.
For now, these new features — which build on enhancements in June — are only rolling out to people in the U.S.

 Zuckerberg: Facebook to make political advertising more transparent   
 4:49  PM ET Thu, 21 Sept 2017 |  01:12 
 CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Thursday that Facebook will share information with Congress about suspected Russian-linked election ads.
 In early September, Facebook released results of an investigation into the 2016 U.S. election. The investigation found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June 2015 to May 2017 associated with roughly 3,000 ads believed to be from Russian profiles. The ads had been shared with a special counsel investigating the Russian influence in the election.
Zuckerberg said he instructed his staff on Thursday morning to provide those ads to Congress as well. Facebook has reached out to congressional leaders to agree on a process of handing over the ads.
 ""We are committed to rising to the occasion. Our sophistication in handling these threats is growing and improving quickly. We will continue working with the government to understand the full extent of Russian interference,"" Zuckerberg said.
Zuckerberg's comments mark a shift in tone from his initial reaction to the election. Zuckerberg initially pushed back on claims that viral fake news stories could have any sway on the election, calling the idea ""crazy"" and saying that his critics lacked ""empathy"" for President Donald Trump's supporters.
But pressure on Facebook has grown over time. 
Some congressional investigators saw Russian activity on Facebook as key to understanding the extent of Moscow's influence on the election. Federal Election Commission member Ellen Weintraub called for an overhaul of disclaimer rules around political advertisements on the internet earlier this month.
 ""So we're going to bring Facebook to an even higher standard of transparency. Not only will you have to disclose which page paid for an ad, but we will also make it so you can visit an advertiser's page and see the ads they're currently running to any audience on Facebook,"" Zuckerberg said.
Following Zuckerberg's announcement on Thursday, Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called it an ""important and absolutely necessary first step.""
Facebook said it didn't know the ads had been purchased by a Russian operation, and it's possible there may be more similar advertisements still on Facebook. Facebook has shut down about 470 accounts believed to be operated out of Russia, associated with an entity called the Internet Research Agency.
""It's possible that government investigators have information that could help us, and we welcome any information the authorities are willing to share to help with our own investigations,"" Facebook's company blog post said.
While Facebook does not usually disclose user content, Facebook said it decided to release the content to the government because ""the public deserves a full accounting of what happened in the 2016 election.""  
""Now, I'm not going to sit here and tell you we're going to catch all bad content in our system,"" Zuckerberg said. ""We don't check what people say before they say it, and frankly, I don't think our society should want us to. Freedom means you don't have to ask permission first, and that by default you can say what you want. If you break our community standards or the law, then you're going to face consequences afterwards. We won't catch everyone immediately, but we can make it harder to try to interfere."" 
Zuckerberg called for other technology companies to collaborate on safeguarding future elections, so that bad actors that are abusing other platforms can be found more quickly.
Zuckerberg's comments come ahead of Germany's elections this weekend.
""We have been working to ensure the integrity of the German elections this weekend, from taking actions against thousands of fake accounts, to partnering with public authorities like the Federal Office for Information Security, to sharing security practices with the candidates and parties,"" Zuckerberg said. ""We're also examining the activity of accounts we've removed and have not yet found a similar type of effort in Germany.""
He spoke on Thursday in a livestream on his Facebook profile. The feed started at 3:30 p.m. ET. Facebook also released two blog posts on the issue, one with overarching information and another from Facebook's general counsel.  
 Here's a full blog post from Facebook: 
 September 21, 2017 Hard Questions: More on Russian Ads By Elliot Schrage, Vice President of Policy and Communications 1) Why did Facebook finally decide to share the ads with Congress? As our General Counsel has explained, this is an extraordinary investigation — one that raises questions that go to the integrity of the US elections. After an extensive legal and policy review, we've concluded that sharing the ads we've discovered with Congress, in a manner that is consistent with our obligations to protect user information, will help government authorities complete the vitally important work of assessing what happened in the 2016 election. That is an assessment that can be made only by investigators with access to classified intelligence and information from all relevant companies and industries — and we want to do our part. Congress is best placed to use the information we and others provide to inform the public comprehensively and completely. 2) Why are you sharing these with Special Counsel and Congress — and not releasing them to the public? Federal law places strict limitations on the disclosure of account information. Given the sensitive national security and privacy issues involved in this extraordinary investigation, we think Congress is best placed to use the information we and others provide to inform the public comprehensively and completely. For further understanding on this decision, see our General Counsel's post. 3) Let's go back to the beginning. Did Facebook know when the ads were purchased that they might be part of a Russian operation? Why not? No, we didn't. The vast majority of our over 5 million advertisers use our self-service tools. This allows individuals or businesses to create a Facebook Page, attach a credit card or some other payment method and run ads promoting their posts. In some situations, Facebook employees work directly with our larger advertisers. In the case of the Russian ads, none of those we found involved in-person relationships. At the same time, a significant number of advertisers run ads internationally, and a high number of advertisers run content that addresses social issues — an ad from a non-governmental organization, for example, that addresses women's rights. So there was nothing necessarily noteworthy at the time about a foreign actor running an ad involving a social issue. Of course, knowing what we've learned since the election, some of these ads were indeed both noteworthy and problematic, which is why our CEO today announced a number of important steps we are taking to help prevent this kind of deceptive interference in the future. 4) Do you expect to find more ads from Russian or other foreign actors using fake accounts? It's possible. When we're looking for this type of abuse, we cast a wide net in trying to identify any activity that looks suspicious. But it's a game of cat and mouse. Bad actors are always working to use more sophisticated methods to obfuscate their origins and cover their tracks. That in turn leads us to devise new methods and smarter tactics to catch them — things like machine learning, data science and highly trained human investigators. And, of course, our internal inquiry continues. It's possible that government investigators have information that could help us, and we welcome any information the authorities are willing to share to help with our own investigations. Using ads and other messaging to affect political discourse has become a common part of the cybersecurity arsenal for organized, advanced actors. This means all online platforms will need to address this issue, and get smarter about how to address it, now and in the future. 5) I've heard that Facebook disabled tens of thousands of accounts in France and only hundreds in the United States. Is this accurate? No, these numbers represent different things and can't be directly compared. To explain it, it's important to understand how large platforms try to stop abusive behavior at scale. Staying ahead of those who try to misuse our service is an ongoing effort led by our security and integrity teams, and we recognize this work will never be done. We build and update technical systems every day to make it easier to respond to reports of abuse, detect and remove spam, identify and eliminate fake accounts, and prevent accounts from being compromised. This work also reduces the distribution of content that violates our policies, since fake accounts often distribute deceptive material, such as false news, hoaxes, and misinformation. This past April, we announced improvements to these systems aimed at helping us detect fake accounts on our service more effectively. As we began to roll out these changes globally, we took action against tens of thousands of fake accounts in France. This number represents fake accounts of all varieties, the most common being those that are used for financially-motivated spam. While we believe that the removal of these accounts also reduced the spread of disinformation, it's incorrect to state that these tens of thousands of accounts represent organized campaigns from any particular country or set of countries. In contrast, the approximately 470 accounts and Pages we shut down recently were identified by our dedicated security team that manually investigates specific, organized threats. They found that this set of accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another — and were likely operated out of Russia.

Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook on Friday settled a lawsuit over issuing reclassified shares that some investors argued would decrease the value of their investment, and announced it was abandoning that plan.
The class action shareholder lawsuit was intended to block Facebook from issuing reclassified C shares, which some investors argued could cause shares to lose billions of dollars of value when they were traded. The new C shares would be publicly listed but come with no voting rights. 
 The classification would have allowed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to keep voting control of the company, even if he decided to lower his total ownership stake. The lawsuit said the new structure would have meant that Zuckerberg could own as little as 2 percent of the company and still keep voting control.
In a note on Facebook in April 2016, Zuckerberg wrote the plan was created in order to allow him and his wife Priscilla Chan to donate money to solving global issues like curing diseases, improving education and climate change. It would also still allow him to stay ""committed"" to improving and leading Facebook, including helping the company grow internet access around the world, improve its artificial intelligence and develop virtual and augmented reality.
The trial was scheduled to begin September 22, and Zuckerberg was scheduled to take the stand. 
Other people who were expected to testify include Facebook board members Marc Andreessen, CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Susan Desmond-Hellmann, and former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles.

 Trump calls Facebook Russia ads 'a hoax'   
 2:21  PM ET Fri, 22 Sept 2017 |  01:07 
 President Donald Trump on Friday called reports of Facebook ads that were purchased by fake Russian accounts a ""hoax,"" less than a day after Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would share the content of the roughly 3,000 ads with congressional investigators. 
 ""The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook,"" Trump wrote in a tweet early Friday morning, before pivoting to attack his opponent in last year's election, Hillary Clinton. ""What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?""
 Trump Tweet
 Trump Tweet
 The tweet marked the first time the president has weighed in on the Russian ads, which Facebook says were aimed at ""amplifying divisive social and political messages"" in an apparent attempt to influence the 2016 elections.
A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request from CNBC for clarification about what exactly the president thinks is false about the ads. 
Facebook announced on Sept. 6 that it had discovered the ads while reviewing its content. It has since shared them with Justice Department Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. 
Mueller's probe has so far ensnared a number of Trump's presidential campaign aides, infuriating Trump in the process.

 Here's what should keep Facebook shareholders up at night   
 4:18  PM ET Fri, 22 Sept 2017 |  00:48 
 The power of Facebook advertising — let's say they can identify 2 billion people around the world based on 200 points of data, which allows them to offer advertisers the holy grail of targeting. Now companies know exactly who is seeing their ads — only the ""right"" potential consumers. This is unheard of in the history of the world.
 Facebook's shareholders have been rightfully rewarded for the company's marketing prowess. It now sports a market capitalization of $500 billion – the only two companies worth more are Apple and Microsoft. Exxon, J&J, Google, JP Morgan, Berkshire – they're all worth less.
So it is true that Facebook has an amazing marketing product and it is also true that the world now fully appreciates this fact.
 But what if not everyone agrees to play along? What if this ability to micro-target every living human being to the degree of 200 individual data points is not okay anymore? For example, what if a foreign government — say, Germany — decides that 200 data points is too much information for Facebook to collect and make available about their citizens to advertisers? What if Germany says, ""You know what? This is not okay. From now on, you can only utilize 100 of those 200 data points. We don't want our sovereign citizens targeted to that degree by anyone — dishwashing detergent firms, political parties, special interest groups — it's too much influence.""
Now what if this happens, and Facebook acquiesces so as to stay out of court, and then a month later Japan says they'd like the same thing? And then the Netherlands? And then the state of Florida? And then the city of Las Vegas? And so on? What if the world begins to make the decision that no entity — corporate or otherwise — ought to have the sort of broad, unchecked free reign that Facebook (and to a lesser extent, Google) has enjoyed over the last few years?
Does Facebook face them all down, one after another, to preserve their advertising technology advantage? Or do they willfully comply and water down their programs? In either case, could this conceivably be a positive for shareholders of Facebook stock?
I can't imagine how.
Can you?
Now you might be saying, ""That's not realistic! No one is going to require Facebook to become less good at what they do!""
You'd be wrong. This is absolutely within the realm of possibility, historically speaking. They did it to Microsoft twenty years ago and it's taken the company approximately this entire span of time since to recover. They did it to AT&T back in the day, the irony being that shareholders made a lot more money once all of the component spin-off subsidiaries were given to them. They did it to John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, even though it took almost twenty years to make it through the courts. By the time they were done with him, it was almost like a relief.
Governments that feel threatened or genuinely fear for the safety and/or competitive position of their constituents will absolutely take action if they feel the need to. Uber must now negotiate with the city of London in order to keep operating there beyond the end of September. They'll probably get to stay, but not without concessions. Might some of those concessions include a lightening up of the company's competitive advantages over the black car taxi system that's long held sway in that city?
This week Facebook announced that it will make public all of the ads purchased by Russian interests during the 2016 elections. That's a start. But the bigger question should not be about the content of the ads or the purported sponsors. It should be about how it can be possible that ads like these can be so lethally effective. The answer, of course, is that Facebook has a one-of-a-kind delivery method to ensure direct hits. How will that sit with Congress when they begin to get their heads around this concept. I am convinced that, for the most part, they are until now completely clueless.
If a government decides that there is a such thing as too much influence being held by a corporation, technology giant or otherwise, there is a risk to its shareholders. We do not live and work in some sort of utopian paradise where all progress is universally celebrated and allowed, unmolested, to do what it will, to whom it will, with what information it pleases.
And I'm not sure how many fishing trips and RV rides Mark Zuckerberg has the time to go on, around the world, in order to preserve the company's monopoly on our collective attention.

 Zuckerberg: Facebook to make political advertising more transparent   
 4:49  PM ET Thu, 21 Sept 2017 |  01:12 
 On Wednesday, in response to a ProPublica report that Facebook enabled advertisers to target users with offensive terms like ""Jew hater,"" Sheryl Sandberg, the company's chief operating officer, apologized and vowed that the company would adjust its ad-buying tools to prevent similar problems in the future.
As I read her statement, my eyes lingered over one line in particular:
""We never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way — and that is on us,"" Ms. Sandberg wrote.
 It was a candid admission that reminded me of a moment in Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein,"" after the scientist Victor Frankenstein realizes that his cobbled-together creature has gone rogue.
""I had been the author of unalterable evils,"" he says, ""and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had created should perpetrate some new wickedness.""
More from The New York Times: This was the alt-right's favorite chat app. Then came Charlottesville. Behind the velvet ropes of Facebook's private groups  Facebook to turn over Russian-linked ads to Congress 
If I were a Facebook executive, I might feel a Frankensteinian sense of unease these days. The company has been hit with a series of scandals that have bruised its image, enraged its critics and opened up the possibility that in its quest for global dominance, Facebook may have created something it can't fully control.
Facebook is fighting through a tangled morass of privacy, free-speech and moderation issues with governments all over the world. Congress is investigating reports that Russian operatives used targeted Facebook ads to influence the 2016 presidential election. In Myanmar, activists are accusing Facebook of censoring Rohingya Muslims, who are under attack from the

 country's military. In Africa, the social network faces accusations that it helped human traffickers extort victims' families by leaving up abusive videos.
Few of these issues stem from willful malice on the company's part. It's not as if a Facebook engineer in Menlo Park personally greenlighted Russian propaganda, for example. On Thursday, the company said it would release political advertisements bought by Russians for the 2016 election, as well as some information related to the ads, to congressional investigators.
But the troubles do make it clear that Facebook was simply not built to handle problems of this magnitude. It's a technology company, not an intelligence agency or an international diplomatic corps. Its engineers are in the business of building apps and selling advertising, not determining what constitutes hate speech in Myanmar. And with two billion users, including 1.3 billion who use it every day, moving ever greater amounts of their social and political activity onto Facebook, it's possible that the company is simply too big to understand all of the harmful ways people might use its products.
""The reality is that if you're at the helm of a machine that has two billion screaming, whiny humans, it's basically impossible to predict each and every possible nefarious use case,"" said Antonio García Martínez, author of the book ""Chaos Monkeys"" and a former Facebook advertising executive. ""It's a Whac-a-Mole problem.""
Elliot Schrage, Facebook's vice president of communications and public policy, said in a statement: ""We work very hard to support our millions of advertisers worldwide, but sometimes — rarely — bad actors win. We invest a lot of time, energy and resources to make these rare events extinct, and we're grateful to our community for calling out where we can do better."" When Mark Zuckerberg built Facebook in his Harvard dorm room in 2004, nobody could have imagined its becoming a censorship tool for repressive regimes, an arbiter of global speech standards or a vehicle for foreign propagandists.
But as Facebook has grown into the global town square, it has had to adapt to its own influence. Many of its users view the social network as an essential utility, and the company's decisions — which posts to take down, which ads to allow, which videos to show — can have real life-or-death consequences around the world. The company has outsourced some decisions to complex algorithms, which carries its own risks, but many of the toughest choices Facebook faces are still made by humans.
""They still see themselves as a technology middleman,"" said Mr. García Martínez. ""Facebook is not supposed to be an element of a propaganda war. They're completely not equipped to deal with that."" Even if Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg don't have personal political aspirations, as has been rumored, they are already leaders of an organization that influences politics all over the world. And there are signs that Facebook is starting to understand its responsibilities. It has hired a slew of counterterrorism experts and is expanding teams of moderators around the world to look for and remove harmful content.
On Thursday, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a video posted on Facebook that the company would take several steps to help protect the integrity of elections, like making political ads more transparent and expanding partnerships with election commissions.
""We will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and fair elections around the world, but also to give everyone a voice and to be a force for good in democracy everywhere,"" he said.
But there may not be enough guardrails in the world to prevent bad outcomes on Facebook, whose scale is nearly inconceivable. Alex Stamos, Facebook's security chief, said last month that the company shuts down more than a million user accounts every day for violating Facebook's community standards. Even if only 1 percent of Facebook's daily active users misbehaved, it would still mean 13 million rule breakers, about the number of people in Pennsylvania.
In addition to challenges of size, Facebook's corporate culture is one of cheery optimism. That may have suited the company when it was an upstart, but it could hamper its ability to accurately predict risk now that it's a setting for large-scale global conflicts.
Several current and former employees described Facebook to me as a place where engineers and executives generally assume the best of users, rather than preparing for the worst. Even the company's mission statement — ""Give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together"" — implies that people who are given powerful tools will use those tools for socially constructive purposes. Clearly, that is not always the case.
Hiring people with darker views of the world could help Facebook anticipate conflicts and misuse. But pessimism alone won't fix all of Facebook's issues. It will need to keep investing heavily in defensive tools, including artificial intelligence and teams of human moderators, to shut down bad actors. It would also be wise to deepen its knowledge of the countries where it operates, hiring more regional experts who understand the nuances of the local political and cultural environment.
Facebook could even take a page from Wall Street's book, and create a risk department that would watch over its engineering teams, assessing new products and features for potential misuse before launching them to the world.
Now that Facebook is aware of its own influence, the company can't dodge responsibility for the world it has helped to build. In the future, blaming the monster won't be enough.

 Facebook drops plans for new class of shares   
 7:26  PM ET Fri, 22 Sept 2017 |  01:02 
 Under investor pressure, Facebook is squashing a proposed ownership structure that would allow CEO Mark Zuckerberg to retain voting control of the company — even as he sold millions of his shares of company stock. 
 Last year, some shareholders filed a class action lawsuit to block Facebook from issuing reclassified C shares, which would allow Zuckerberg to maintain voting control of the company even as he sold off most of his shares to support philanthropic causes.
The proposed C shares would be publicly listed but come with no voting rights. Investors argued that the proposed ownership structure could cause them to lose billions of dollars of value when the shares traded. 
 ""Facebook's board determined that withdrawing the reclassification was in the best interests of Facebook and its shareholders,"" a spokesperson told CNBC via email.
Zuckerberg said in a post on Facebook that the company's stock has performed better than expected, making it unnecessary for the company issue reclassified shares.
""Over the past year and a half, Facebook's business has performed well and the value of our stock has grown to the point that I can fully fund our philanthropy and retain voting control of Facebook for 20 years or more,"" he wrote. ""As a result, I've asked our board to withdraw the proposal to reclassify our stock -- and the board has agreed."" He also said that we would sell between 35 million and 75 million shares in the company over the next 18 months to support philanthropic efforts.
It was reported earlier that Facebook had settled the lawsuit, but the company announced it will abandon the plan instead.
""We are gratified that Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg have agreed not to proceed with the reclassification we were challenging,"" Lee Rudy, partner at Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check LLP which was representing the shareholders, said in a statement. ""This result is a full victory for Facebook's stockholders, and achieved everything we could have hoped to obtain by winning a permanent injunction at trial.""

 Instagram said Monday that it's added another 100 million monthly users. That brings the photo-sharing app to 800 million monthly active users, up from 700 million in April, according to Carolyn Everson, vice president of global marketing solutions at Facebook, who spoke at an Advertising Week event in New York City.
 Five hundred million of those are daily active users, the company said. That means that Instagram is still ahead of rival Snap in terms of users, based on Snap's last report. Snap said in August that it had 173 million daily active users.
The announcement from Facebook-owned Instagram further solidifies Facebook as one of the most dominant companies in online advertising, posing a challenge for underdogs. Time spent watching video on Instagram is up more than 80 percent year over year, the company also said on Monday, and four times as many videos are being produced every day on Instagram compared with a year ago.
 Instagram also said that it has doubled the number of advertisers on its platform since March, growing its advertiser base to 2 million.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin smiles in the Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, on April 18, 2014.
 The Facebook ads that Russian operatives purchased to try to influence U.S. voters during the 2016 election highlighted the Black Lives Matter movement and other hot-button, divisive issues, said a person familiar with the situation.
 The content of the ads was previously reported by The Washington Post.
This person, who requested anonymity, also said the ads will be shared with congressional investigators in a matter of days.
 Facebook said earlier this month that an internal investigation had found that groups with ties to Russia had spent $100,000 on ads designed to influence the attitudes of U.S. voters in the last presidential campaign.
The investigation found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June 2015 to May 2017 associated with roughly 3,000 ads.
That was a reversal from late last year, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg argued that fake news on Facebook did not play a key role in the election's outcome.
Facebook had contacted the FBI during the summer of 2016 when it first suspected Russian involvement but was unable to confirm its suspicions until recently.
Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said last week that a hearing on the matter is a question of ""when.""

President Donal Trump (R) and his daughter Ivanka (L) chairs a a workforce development roundtable discussion at Waukesha County Technical College during his visit in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on June 13, 2017.
 President Donald Trump will issue a new directive Monday to supercharge the U.S. government's support for science, tech, engineering and mathematics, including coding education, three sources familiar with the White House's thinking told Recode.
To start, Trump is set to sign a presidential memorandum at the White House later today that tasks the Department of Education to devote at least $200 million of its grant funds each year to so-called STEM fields, as the administration seeks to train workers for high-demand computer-science jobs of the future.
And on Tuesday, Trump's daughter and advisor, Ivanka, is expected to head to Detroit, where she will join business leaders for an event unveiling a series of private-sector commitments — from Amazon, Facebook, Google, GM, Quicken Loans and others — meant to boost U.S. coding and computer-science classes and programs, the sources said. The exact total of their financial pledges is unclear.
 The new White House emphasis on STEM and computer science amounts to something of a policy coup for the tech industry, which long has implored the U.S. government to prioritize education in those high-demand fields.
In the eyes of Code.org, one of the organizations working with the White House, not even half of U.S. high schools offer computer science classes. To that end,  Apple chief executive Tim Cook urged Trump to make coding a requirement in public schools when he joined the president and other tech leaders at the  White House's so-called ""tech week"" this June.
A month later, Cook and other business leaders, including Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson and Microsoft President Brad Smith, huddled with the Trump administration — including Ivanka — on a private call to discuss ways to rethink federal policy through a tech lens, sources told Recode this week.
But the White House's announcement nonetheless comes at a perilous moment for tech, corporate America and the Trump presidency.

A month ago, scores of executives, including tech giants,  resigned their posts on two councils advising Trump on business and manufacturing issues, citing Trump's early refusal to blame the violence in Charlottesville, Va., on neo-Nazi demonstrators. More recently, the leaders of Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have  openly criticized the president for ending an immigration program known as DACA, which protects children brought to the United States illegally from being deported.
Many of those tech giants are now lobbying the White House and Congress intensely to restore the legal shield for roughly  800,000 beneficiaries, known as Dreamers. And those participating in the White House's computer-science announcement this week could find themselves under immense, new pressure — particularly from their employees — to use the opportunity to continue  trying to advance immigration reform and other, related issues.
Some of the tech giants promising new dollars for coding education came to the table as a result of the Internet Association, the Washington, D.C.-based lobbying voice for the Valley. Other participants include Accenture, Intuit, Salesforce and Pluralsight, an online education company.
Ivanka Trump, for her part, has focused recently on issues like  workforce development. ""By supporting computer science curriculum in our schools, I hope that all children will have the opportunity to become fluent in this language of the future,"" she posted to Instagram in June — along with a photo in which she's sitting with her daughter, Arabella, learning how to code.
But that, too, hasn't come without controversy. Earlier this year, a prominent advocate for more women in tech — Girls Who Code — slammed Ivanka for  being ""complicit"" in advancing Trump's agenda.

 Apple dragging down Facebook, FANG stocks: Alpine Funds' Mark Spellman   
 6:04  PM ET Mon, 25 Sept 2017 |  02:58 
 Facebook shares fell 4.5 percent on Monday, the worst day since Nov. 3, as investors digested the company's reaction to political pressure and new planned share sales from CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 
 The social media company made headlines several times last week after its chief executive returned to the office from paternity leave. Upon his return, Zuckerberg took swift action on two major conflicts facing Facebook: a lawsuit over a proposed new class of shares and a probe into election advertisements. 
Facebook settled the lawsuit by abandoning the proposed new class of shares, which would have included no voting rights and made it easier for Zuckerberg to maintain voting control over the company even as he cashed out his shares. The suing shareholders felt it was a bad idea to ""separate economic interest from voting control,"" Stuart Grant, an attorney for Facebook shareholders, told CNBC on Monday.
 Following the settlement, Zuckerberg said he would sell between 35 million and 75 million shares in the company over the next 18 months to support his other company, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which invests in technology to address social issues. 
Some investors consider high levels of stock ownership from insiders — like the CEO — as a sign that management has confidence in the company's future prospects.
The news of Zuckerberg's share sales came after he waded publicly into the political sphere earlier in the week. Zuckerberg said he instructed his staff on Thursday morning to provide Congress with 3,000 ads believed to be from Russian profiles, in an effort to assess ""what happened in the 2016 election.""  
Some congressional investigators saw Russian activity on Facebook as key to understanding the extent of Moscow's influence on the election. Former President Barack Obama was also reportedly concerned.
The headlines around Zuckerberg cast a shadow on some of Facebook's good news: Instagram said Monday that it's added another 100 million monthly users.
""I do think investors are worried about regulatory scrutiny, and a lack of support from the White House — I am,"" Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Heartland Financial, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Monday. 
Tengler said that Heartland has large stakes in Facebook, Google and Apple shares, but has been selling them. 
""It feels a little bit like Microsoft in the '90s,""  Tengler said. ""I think investors are kind of rethinking, 'What is this going to mean?'"" 
Facebook's move lower also came as the technology sector, as a whole, traded lower. The S&P 500 information technology sector closed 1.4 percent lower, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day down about 0.9 percent.
But Facebook shares traded at a volume more than 3 times higher than the average over the past 30 days. 
""It's a correction,"" Tengler said. ""Not a sell-off.""

 Why the top stock sell-off isn't based on fundamentals   
 6:31  PM ET Tue, 26 Sept 2017 |  01:04 
 Declines in some of the stock market's highest-flying technology stocks may have investors second-guessing, so CNBC's Jim Cramer took to the fundamentals to help explain the drops.
 ""Let me give you my take on the dramatic see-saw-like action in the leaders of this market,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""First, let's tackle the real cause of the weakness that started last week: technology. Come on, you all know the epicenter here. It's Apple.""
Recent talk of the tech giant's iPhone 8 sales being worse than expected has weighed on shares of Apple as well as its suppliers.
 Cramer said the worries were overblown, particularly since Apple can't possibly know how many phones it will sell before it sells them.
""Needless to say, the bias on Wall Street always seems to be not that you should own Apple, but you should trade it. In the end, most people who try to trade Apple end up buying high and selling low — the opposite of what you're supposed to do,"" Cramer said.
The ""Mad Money"" host compared the stock of Apple to legendary boxer Muhammad Ali, who inspired the term ""GOAT,"" or ""Greatest of All Time."" Betting against Apple would be like betting against Ali, he said — odds are, you'll lose.
Cramer added that, next to other consumer product companies like Clorox, Procter & Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive, Apple's valuation is still the cheapest of the cohort.
""So, the proximate sell-off cause, at least number one? Apple. Now, I am saying it's been pretty neutralized. Sure, the stock can go lower, but at these levels, it's beginning to reflect the failure of the iPhone 9, and that product doesn't exist,"" Cramer said.
The second issue plaguing the market is concern over a slowdown in the cloud, a central feature of FAANNG, Cramer's extended acronym for the high-flying stocks of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Nvidia and Google, now Alphabet.
Analysts were struck by Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen's comments in a conference call that suggested cloud growth was temporarily slowing in one line of Adobe's business.
To add to the pressure, Tesla announced a partnership with Advanced Micro Devices to build an artificial intelligence chip for self-driving cars, a relationship that could curb Tesla's existing rapport with Nvidia. But Cramer said the market was exaggerating that loss as well.
""Remember, the cloud lives in the data center. So if the cloud's slowing, the data center should be slowing, too,"" he said. ""Yet last night Nvidia announced that its new line of chips won business from three of the largest Chinese data center operators out there: Alibaba, TenCent and Baidu, which are growing like mad. I'll match those orders against a defeat at Tesla any day of the week.""
Overall, Cramer attributed the selling in these stocks to mutual and hedge funds wanting to rake in solid quarterly profits and some large hedge funds facing redemption, in which managers are required to raise capital to cover costs.
""Bottom line? We're at the end of a good quarter in a good year, and we're seeing profit-taking and forced selling of the winners while some money's going into cheaper stocks and, when you put it that way, there's a kernel of rationality to the entire move,"" the ""Mad Money"" host concluded. ""Does it mean the selling is over in the high fliers? Nope, it's not the end of the month yet. Does it mean it could be over soon? Maybe, but only when we hear all of those scary stories about crashes of yore in the month of October. But alas, that could give you an even better buying opportunity.""

 Facebook will soon host official NFL content, including recaps of every regular season and playoff game, in a partnership with the league. 
 The multiyear deal that was announced Tuesday is an important step in Facebook's push to offer premium content and a telling move for the NFL, which has seen its TV ratings consistently fall as streaming services draw away viewers. 
""We have millions of fans on Facebook, and they continue to demonstrate an incredible appetite for NFL content,"" said Hans Schroeder, chief operating officer of NFL Media. ""We're excited to bring a compelling set of highlights and shows from the NFL and our Clubs to our fans on Facebook,"" he said in a statement.
 The official game recaps will be available to Facebook users around the world. The internet giant will also host content from the NFL's production arm, NFL Films, including NFL Turning Point and Sound FX on the Facebook Watch feature. Live game coverage is not included in the deal. 
""We're excited for Watch to become a destination for NFL fans to catch up on the latest on-field action and connect with one another,"" said Dan Reed, Facebook's head of global sports partnerships.

A Walmart worker organizes products for the Christmas season at a Walmart store in Teterboro, New Jersey.
 America's largest employer is now working with America's largest social network.
Walmart has signed on as a new customer for Workplace, the  enterprise version of Facebook's social network specifically for interoffice communication.
Facebook won't say exactly how many of Walmart's 2.3 million employees are using the Workplace service, but confirmed that it is Facebook's largest Workplace deployment in the U.S., which means there are more Walmart employees with access to the product than any of Facebook's other customers. (Again, though, this doesn't necessarily mean that all those with access are using it.)
 Walmart is not yet paying for Workplace — Facebook offers a 90-day free trial of the product — but will be a paying customer once the free trial is over, according to a Facebook spokesperson.
Workplace doesn't make a lot of headlines, but the company claims it's growing. Workplace has 14,000 companies using the product, including Starbucks, Spotify and Lyft; when Workplace officially launched last October, Facebook had just over 1,000 companies on board.
The Walmart news is a reminder that Facebook's business is beginning to expand beyond digital advertising, where it makes the vast, vast majority of its revenue. Facebook doesn't break out revenue for Workplace, but the product is ads-free; the company makes money by charging a monthly subscription fee.

 And despite Facebook's  minimum wage of $15, which it established for all of its contractors in 2015, the paychecks don't go far around San Francisco, where the cost of living is  62 percent higher than the U.S. average.
One contractor, Jiovanny Martinez, can't make ends meet with just his wages from the tech giant. The security guard at Facebook also drives Lyft and works as a park ranger to support his family, The Guardian reports.

 Sky-high rent prices in San Francisco are forcing lots of employees to get creative with housing.
A married couple named Nicole and Victor — both contract workers in the cafeteria at Facebook's headquarters — are living in a two-car garage with their three children.
They borrow money from friends and family to stay afloat, they tell The Guardian in a separate article, and occasionally resort to payday loans. They cannot afford Facebook's health care plan.
And it's not just the contractors who are struggling to get by.
Unique Parsha, who earns well above Facebook's minimum wage as a content specialist, sleeps in the backseat of her car in a 24-Hour Fitness parking lot.
Between her student loans and other bills, housing in the Bay Area is unaffordable,  she tells The Guardian: ""It's not enough pay to survive based on the rent that's out there. How can people survive? A one-bedroom is at least $1,800. That's my whole check right there.""

 Some engineers have even gone so far as to ask their boss Mark Zuckerberg for help. And Facebook isn't ignoring the issue. 
The company plans to turn the 56-acre Menlo Science & Technology Park it bought in 2015 into a company town they're calling the Willow Campus. It will include a grocery store, pharmacy and shopping center, and 1,500 new housing units, 15 percent of which will be priced below the market rate.
We've reached out to the company for comment and will update the story when we hear back.

 Meanwhile, it's not just employees at Facebook who are having trouble coping in Silicon Valley. A Twitter employee earning $160,000 in San Francisco says he's barely scraping by and even several tech workers making between $100,000 and $700,000 a year find themselves rent-burdened.
Things are even worse in San Francisco for employees working in different sectors. Doctors can't afford 58 percent of the homes in the city, according to Trulia, and teachers can expect to put up to 77 percent of their income toward housing, reports Curbed San Francisco.

Chamath Palihapitiya speaking at the 2017 Delivering Alpha conference in New York on Sept. 12, 2017.
 Investors who followed Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya into the early stages of two investments he advocated would have made an awful lot of money.
 Palihapitiya was early in both Facebook, the ubiquitous social network, and bitcoin, the disruptive crypotcurrency that has sharply divided investors who continue to argue over its legitimacy.
Even with the major gains both have made, Palihapitiya remains hot on tech stocks in general, and bitcoin in particular. The digital currency, despite some volatile times, has soared nearly 300 percent this year.
 That has come even though JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called it a fraud that is doomed to fail.
""Nobody can stop it because nobody can control it,"" Palihapitiya said in an exclusive CNBC PRO interview 
 at the Delivering Alpha conference on Sept. 12. ""The idea that the government can put curbs on this is actually pretty specious.""
Rather than debate its status as a currency or its use for nefarious purposes, he said there should be a broader discussion about how to put it to better use.
""As far as I'm concerned, the genie is out of the bottle,"" he said. ""Now the real question is how can we productively use it to solve some of society's issues around the financial services infrastructure.""

 Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg responds to Trump   
 7:27  PM ET Wed, 27 Sept 2017 |  00:58 
 Mark Zuckerberg said late Wednesday that President Trump's tweet alleging that Facebook has always been against him is wrong and said the social network was an overall force for good during the 2016 U.S. election campaign.
 ""Trump says Facebook is against him. Liberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don't like. That's what running a platform for all ideas looks like,"" the Facebook CEO said in a post.
Zuckerberg also expressed regret about a comment he made shortly after the election, in which he dismissed concerns that Facebook impacted the campaign as crazy.
 ""After the election, I made a comment that I thought the idea misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of the election was a crazy idea. Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it. This is too important an issue to be dismissive.""
The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Burr, said earlier this month he intended to call Facebook to Washington to testify about the impact its political ads may have influenced the campaign.

 How this company found success with the internet's obsession with animals   
 12:26  PM ET Wed, 27 Sept 2017 |  01:13 
 When The Dodo founder and chief creative officer Izzie Lerer started her animal-focused media company, she always aimed to be a social-first publisher.
 Thanks to early pivoting to online video, the company is among the top Facebook video publishers with an average of 2.1 billion views a month and runs one of Watch's most viewed shows.
""It became pretty clear [social video] was the way of the world, animal content in particular,"" Lerer said. ""People connect to animals visually and how they move. Video is a pretty obvious intuitive thing for the kind of work we do."" 
 Though The Dodo has a website, the majority of its views and traffic come from Facebook. Its video ""Kids Growing Up with Dogs"" is still one of the top videos on Facebook to date at 360 million views. And it's found success on Facebook's new TV initiative Facebook's Watch with ""Comeback Kids: Animal Edition,"" the second most watched show on the platform, according to public view counts. The third episode — which centers around a neglected pony which is nursed back to health — is currently the most viewed Facebook's Watch video at 55 million views to date. 
""In the earlier days, our views were shorter, I would say sub 7 seconds,"" The Dodo president YuJung Kim said. ""Now we're looking at 5 to 7 minute video episodes we produce, where over 15 percent of the audience makes it to the very end. As users familiarity with Facebook grows, we've kind of ridden that wave and set the bar higher for how long people should watch a given video.""
 Courtesy of The Dodo
 The company, which is named after the first recorded species that humans drove to extinction, raised $18 million in funding before joining digital media company Group Nine Media, which is run by Izzie's brother Ben Lerer. Group Nine Media received a $100 million minority investment from Discovery Communications in October 2016.
Although her family has a storied media legacy — her father is media executive Ken Lerer, who co-founded Huffington Post and serves as managing director of Lerer Hippeau Ventures — Lerer insists the idea for The Dodo came from ""a personal passion for the subject manner, not because of a passion for the industry."" Lerer, who has a PhD in animal studies with a focus on animal ethics and human relationships from Columbia University, launched The Dodo in 2014 after noticing the viral success of animal videos online but seeing no one ""really owned the space."" 
""At the same time, people are connecting to animals in a new and different way,"" she added. ""We care more about them. There's more giving, and it's tied into a progressive movement. [I thought], 'how do we take these two observations and create a content brand for people who love animals?'""
 Courtesy of The Dodo
The Dodo founder & chief creative officer Izzie Lerer
 Part of the reason for The Dodo's success is it seeks out particular kinds of animal videos with ""the right emotional kernel,"" Lerer said. Usually it means animals that have interesting personality traits or a strong human-animal bond. What it translates to a lot of animal rehabilitation videos and animal rescues, as some as general animal issue awareness videos including a recent New York City museum exhibit that was set to feature dogfighting footage as art and, of course, standard cute viral fodder like a livestream of puppies. 
Due to its success, the company wants to expand into more territories including Spanish-speaking countries. It also wants to experiment with other mediums like 360-degree video and virtual reality. And because of its success with video, it has its eyes set on TV one day. 
""We're pushing deeper into longer content,"" Lerer said. ""Facebook's Watch, those shows are our first foray. Obviously it doesn't end there. What can we do in the form of 30-minute, hour long shows?""

 Trump claims Facebook is 'anti-Trump'   
 12:31  PM ET Wed, 27 Sept 2017 |  00:56 
 President Donald Trump took aim at Facebook on Wednesday, suggesting the social media company was in cahoots with ""Fake News"" networks. 
 Trump tweet
 Facebook is already under pressure in Washington, where investigators and Congress are examining thousands of Facebook advertisements from the 2016 election. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg also recently announced plans to sell millions of shares over the next 1½ years for his Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Its beneficiaries include programs for immigration and prison reform and affordable housing.
 Facebook was not immediately available to comment on Trump's tweet.
The company's curation of news articles has drawn ire from both political parties. Last year, Zuckerberg agreed to meet with conservative leaders after accusations that Facebook had suppressed right-leaning news. But Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has also pressed Facebook and other social media companies on accusations they enabled Russian tampering in the U.S. election, calling recent disclosures the ""tip of the iceberg.""
News organizations, too, have a fraught relationship with the social network. While Facebook and Google offer tools for journalists, a group of news organizations has said the near-duopoly of online advertising is a threat to free press.
Zuckerberg and Trump's relationship has not seen the same public scrutiny as, say, Washington Post owner and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. But one of Facebook's most influential investors, Peter Thiel, is a Trump ally. A recent profile in Vanity Fair suggested Thiel is leaning toward more oversight of large technology companies. (Thiel was not immediately available to comment to CNBC). 
Nonetheless, Facebook's share price has risen nearly 45 percent so far this year, amid broad gains in the technology industry. 
Aside from being avid users of social media, Zuckerberg and Trump have something else in common. Zuckerberg's 2017 tour of America — often compared to a political campaign — has focused on some of the same core issues as Trump's campaign. Zuckerberg has said he hopes to visit 30 states this year because Americans ""need to find a way to change the game so it works for everyone."" 
 But the people were Pro-Trump! Virtually no President has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months-and economy roaring

David Marcus, vice president of Messaging Products at Facebook, speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, April 18, 2017.
 Facebook Messenger is aiming to become your default messaging app.
 CNBC asked Facebook's VP of messaging, David Marcus, if the company wants to replace the default messaging apps on iPhone and Android.
""By all means, yes,"" Marcus said. ""Absolutely.""
 To get there, Facebook is adding new features such as locations, polls and third-party experiences, like sharing music through Spotify, buying tickets through Fandango or posting recipes from Food Network.
""Conversations tend to stick on Messenger because the next best alternative is not as good,"" Marcus said.
Facebook can also help bridge conversations between Apple and Android users because it works the same way on all platforms — unlike the telltale green text bubble that pops up on iMessage whenever it receives a message from an Android device.
In a cyclical fashion if Messenger can get groups of friends to start using it as their main messaging channel, then it can build loyalty. And the companies — and most importantly their advertising dollars — will follow.
 No more 800 numbers
 Now, Facebook is actively encouraging companies to bring their customer service experiences to the platform. 
""The one thing I really want to get rid of is the need for anyone to ever have to call a 1-800 number again,"" Marcus said.
On Tuesday during Advertising Week in New York, the Messenger team unveiled new Objectives, which are advertising goals brands can use to customize conversations using their chatbots. For example, a company could ask Messenger to help it reach more customers or get people to increase traffic to its page and the company will help it craft its chatbot to reach that goal.
""That's my personal crusade,"" said Marcus. ""If we can over the next three years build a habit of people to search on Messenger for businesses they need to interact with, create all kinds of entry points outside of Messenger to bring in those people, and the experience is so much better than a 1-800 call or email or any of the other ways of communicating with businesses, I think that would be a huge transformation for people.""
Younger users haven't yet become accustomed to telephoning companies for customer service, and Messenger can help train them toward using chat first, Marcus pointed out. 
Telephoning ""is not what (young people) want to do,"" he said. ""The way they communicate with friends, it's not like they're calling them anymore. They're just chatting with them all the time on Messenger and other platforms."" 
The messaging experience can save time and create a better experience for customers, as well as lower costs for companies, he said.
For example, T-Mobile is using Messenger to get more customers to buy the new iPhone and sign up for a new plan. The company runs customer support, new customer acquisition, and iPhone purchases through Messenger. It has integrated a Messenger extension that provides an explanatory video about the new phone's features. Clicking on the video to learn more leads directly to a Facebook Messenger chat with T-Mobile. T-Mobile claimed it was able to get seven times more users to sign up with them on Messenger than when it directed people to its website.
Creating company-led experiences for Messenger is free, Marcus said. But if it can convince companies to build on Messenger, more people will use the app and more brands will buy advertising to direct customers to the app experiences.
Facebook's other messaging app, WhatsApp, has different markets where it is most successful — India and Latin America, particularly — but Marcus says the two business units ""share the same goal, and the approach is similar."" 
""Ads has done quite well for us as a company,"" Marcus said smiling. ""I think we'll continue on that trend.""

Delta Air Lines planes at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City.
 Delta Air Lines said Wednesday that customers will be able to send free messages with popular chat platforms while in the air, beginning Sunday. 
 Customers will be able to use iMessage, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger while in the air on a Gogo-equipped flight. Gogo is a popular Wi-Fi platform that costs money, but customers won't need to pay for access to send and receive messages on those three platforms. Standard SMS text messages, which use cellular networks, will not work.
Delta said users won't be able to send photos and videos, likely because such content could slow down the data network.
 T-Mobile in-flight texts are already available on several airlines.

 Senate Committee to summon Google in Russia probe -Report   
 8:07  PM ET Wed, 27 Sept 2017 |  01:08 
 Senate lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election have asked Facebook, Google and Twitter to testify at a Nov. 1 hearing, a source familiar with the matter told Recode on Wednesday.
The inquiry — to be held by the Senate Intelligence Committee — could subject the three tech giants and their executives to uncomfortable questions about the extent to which Kremlin-backed forces may have used their platforms to spread misinformation, and what those companies might have done differently to stop it.
A spokesman for Facebook confirmed the company had received the invite. Spokespeople for Google and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.
 House lawmakers, meanwhile, also plan to drag tech companies to the U.S. Capitol in October, they announced Wednesday.
""In the coming month, we will hold an open hearing with representatives from tech companies in order to better understand how Russia used online tools and platforms to sow discord in and influence our election,"" said Reps. Mike Conaway and Adam Schiff, the top Republican and Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, respectively. In their statement, they did not specify a date, or which specific companies they hoped to grill in October.
Lawmakers from both parties have called for a hearing particularly in light of reports that Russian forces purchased 3,000 ads, at a cost of $100,000, on Facebook in the months before the 2016 election. Some of those ads sought to provoke racial, religious and social tensions in the United States, according to sources who have reviewed them.
So far,  Facebook has briefed the committee and its House counterpart on the matter, and Twitter is set to visit Capitol Hill on Thursday to answer lawmakers' questions.  Google briefed the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this year.

 Facebook is now as dominant in advertising as IBM was in the corporate technology market a generation ago, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Deutsche Bank reiterated its buy rating for Facebook shares, predicting the social media giant will report sales above expectations next year.
""Facebook is the new IBM (in a good way). Just as the saying went that 'nobody got fired for buying IBM' in enterprise tech, we think FB is growing into a similar position in advertising, with best-in-class ad systems (targeting, creative and attribution); a large growing audience across numerous products; and a well-oiled sales machine,"" analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note to clients Thursday.
 ""We see Facebook as having the most upside to estimates over the next 6-12 months and our favorite name among the large cap Internet space.""
Facebook shares was fractionally higher Thursday.
Walmsley raised his price target for the company to $220 from $215, representing 31 percent upside to Wednesday's close.
He said discussions with ad agency executives revealed strength in spending for Facebook ads.
""Our recent ad conversations point to continued growth in same client spend, some noting an acceleration in 3Q relative to 2Q (with particular strength in July),"" he wrote. ""While the important September month is not closed the breadth of positivity makes us comfortable increasing our estimates nonetheless.""
Walmsley raised his 2018 Facebook revenue forecast to $52.2 billion from $50.5 billion versus the $50.7 billion Wall Street consensus.
 The company's shares have rallied 45.8 percent this year through Wednesday, compared with the market's 12 percent gain. But the stock is down 2.5 percent this month compared with the S&P 500's 1.4 percent gain.

 Russian-bought Facebook ads could have reached millions of voters   
 4:11  PM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 |  00:55 
 Facebook has shared some details about the Russian-operated profiles it discovered on its platform with Google, as the search giant — with the rest of the tech industry — continues to probe the extent to which Kremlin-backed misinformation spread through their websites during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
It is unclear if Google has found any suspicious ads or other content after evaluating Facebook's data, an exchange of intel confirmed to Recode today by three sources familiar with the matter. At the very least, Google's investigation appears to be much broader in scope than a similar one by Twitter, which had  drawn the ire of Congress for appearing to be incomplete.
A Google spokesperson declined to comment for this story, as did a Facebook rep.
 More from Recode:

For now, though, Google is slated to deliver a private briefing to U.S. lawmakers studying Russia's political tactics in the coming weeks, additional sources told Recode. A date does not appear to have been set.
And the search-and-advertising giant has been asked to join Facebook and Twitter at two upcoming hearings in the House and Senate where the industry will face questions — out in the open — about its safeguards against Russian political interference in the future.
Earlier this month, Facebook announced that it  found 470 Russia-driven accounts that had purchased 3,000 ads on its social network. Those ads, sources told Recode at the time, sought to stoke racial, religious and other social tensions in the United States, including around issues like Black Lives Matter and gun control.
Beyond publishing its findings, Facebook shared more granular details with its peers — standard practice for many tech giants, which generally band together to address online threats, such as hackers. With the aid of that information,  Twitter discovered about 200 Kremlin-aligned accountsdirectly tied to some of the profiles Facebook previously identified. None of those suspicious Twitter accounts had purchased sponsored tweets, the company told lawmakers.
Twitter still  drew sharp rebukes from Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of two panels investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. In a press conference, Warner charged that Twitter's internal investigation was ""frankly inadequate,"" as it relied too heavily on the data supplied by Facebook. And Warner and his counterpart on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, both encouraged Twitter to dig deeper.
Google's internal inquiry seems much broader than that, but nevertheless, the stakes are just as high. The company is the dominant search and advertising player in the United States. And a driver of Google's expected  $35 billion in ad revenue in 2017 is politics, as candidates, campaigns and causes increasingly take their messages online.
Otherwise, Google has not commented publicly on any activity it might have discovered on its platforms, nor has it announced any changes to its ad practices.

Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook may face growing trouble in Washington, but the company still enjoys a warm reception on Wall Street.
 The company's stock outperformed the shares of the other largest U.S. internet companies in the third quarter, as investors shrugged off negative headlines about extremist content, Russian-bought political ads and even a large intended share sale by CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
Facebook shares rose 13 percent between the opening bell on July 3 and the open of markets Friday morning.
 That outpaced the performance of its social media and online ad rivals Alphabet, Twitter and Snap, as well as those of online retailing giant Amazon.
During the quarter, Alphabet shares rose 5 percent, while Twitter's fell 5 percent and Snap shares dropped 18 percent. Amazon shares were flat.
The gains pushed Facebook's market value to $490 billion as the company maintained its position as the fifth-most valuable U.S. technology firm.
The stock surge came even though Facebook faces a growing number of inquiries in Washington.
Committees in both houses of Congress and the Federal Election Commission are investigating how much fake news and propaganda on the social network influenced the 2016 presidential election.
The company earlier this month said foreign groups spent $100,000 to buy targeted political ads, some of which promoted divisive issues, and said this week it turned the ads over to Congress and special prosecutor Robert Mueller. 
Facebook executives will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee at a Nov. 1 hearing,  a person familiar with the situation told CNBC on Thursday.
The controversy over foreign election meddling via Facebook ads came after ProPublica, a public interest journalism organization, reported it was able to buy advertisements targeted at racists on the site.
The company had previously come under pressure in Europe, where leaders charged it was not removing terrorist-related content fast enough.
To round out the bearish headlines, Zuckerberg said last week he will sell as many as 75 million shares of his holdings over the next 18 months.
Based on the latest stock price, those sales could put up to $12.6 billion worth of Facebook shares up for sale.
But all that wasn't enough to dampen enthusiasm among Facebook bulls, who are optimistic about the company's expected sales and profit growth.
Indeed, profit expectations for Facebook are significantly higher than they were at the start of the quarter.
The company is now expected to post an annual profit of $5.33 per share this year, up from expectations of $4.85 per share three months ago. Facebook's profit was $4.23 a share in 2016.
Third-quarter profit estimates have also gone up, to $1.27 a share from $1.15 three months ago.
Sales are seen rising 42 percent this year to $39.2 billion as Facebook benefits from a surge in digital advertising.

 Russian-bought Facebook ads could have reached millions of voters   
 4:11  PM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 |  00:55 
 With a budget of $100,000, you can run an effective campaign on Facebook no matter if your goals are to reach a mass audience or a smaller, specific group of people according to media buyers. 
 Facebook said in early September that Russian operatives spent $100,000 on ads with ""divisive messages,"" which seemed to be aimed at influencing voters in the U.S. presidential election. Though the ads never directly campaigned for President Donald Trump, Facebook said they mentioned hot-button topics. A recent story by Politico said some ads promoted alternative candidates like Jill Stein and Bernie Sanders, as well as criticized Hillary Clinton and ""praised"" Trump. A source also told CNBC that some of the ads mentioned Black Lives Matter.
At first glance, $100,000 seems like a paltry amount. After all, advertisers spent $9.16 billion with Facebook just in the second quarter of 2017.
 But in fact, a relatively small advertising expenditure can reach a surprisingly large number of people on Facebook, according to industry sources. 
Most Facebook ads for a mass audience — say all 18- to 54-year-olds — will cost about $5 for 1,000 impressions on a webpage (a widely used pricing measurement known as CPM), several media buyers told CNBC. An impression occurs when an ad is called from a server to appear on a webpage. The majority of Facebook ads are bought in an auction style, so demand affects price. Also, while some types of ads are more expensive than others, it doesn't affect the overall price that much.
In general if you had $100,000 you could buy between 15 million and 25 million impressions for a mass audience. 
That doesn't mean you'll reach up to 25 million people. Effective ad campaigns balance how many times people see the ad and the kinds of people who see them. If you're trying to reach as many people as you can with that figure, you'll get a lower frequency with about 75 percent of your audience seeing the ad one time. 
But most agencies operate on the presumption that ads need to be seen by a person five to seven times over an eight-week period to be effective, according to Sean Corcoran, executive director of the Americas at MullenLowe Mediahub. 
With those parameters and $100,000, you're looking at reaching 3 million to 5 million people in a general audience, with that average person getting the same ad five times.
However, advertisers pay a lot more if they want to target specific users. 
""You can get pretty targeted, but then it becomes a math problem,"" Corcoran said. ""But if you want to reach a certain age or certain interests, you can get it down to a pretty small group of people."" 
 Hyper-targeted ads can be four to five times more expensive, carrying a CPM of $20 or $25, said Jeanne Bright, vice president and group director of paid social at DigitasLBi. An example of this kind of targeting: buyers could show ads only to 22-year-old males who just graduated from college and are interested in sports, with a household income of about $50,000 and who lean conservative when it comes to politics, she added. (Bright estimated about 100,000 people would fit those parameters, total.)
 Swing states during an election would likely be pretty expensive because there is a higher demand to advertise in those areas. So in this case, $100,000 might buy you 4 million to 5 million targeted impressions. Assuming it would take five ads per person for a message to sink in, that means you'd reach between 800,000 and 1 million highly targeted users. 
There is one step advertisers could take to get even more targeted, Bright said. Facebook allows agencies to upload lists of specific users as long as they are more than 1,000 people. This type of ad also factors in if the person is logging into Facebook, how frequently they log in and what type of device they are using, she said. 
Agencies use this feature to target customers who may have purchased items from one of their clients, Bright said. However it is feasible that someone could get a list of registered voters in a specific area and request to serve ads to them.
 ""Generally speaking the more targeted you get, the more expensive it gets,"" Bright said. 
These types of list-targeted ads carry a CPM of at least $25, which means $100,000 would deliver no more than 4 million impressions and -- again, given that it takes five impressions to sink in -- would probably reach no more than 800,000 people, and probably less.
That said, the presidential election was essentially decided by voters in a few very closely contested counties in a handful of swing states. According to one analysis by The Washington Post, if about 80,000 voters spread across Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had voted for Hillary Clinton, she'd be president now.
We don't know exactly how precisely the Russian operatives targeted their ads, and it seems unlikely that any voter was swayed by advertising alone. But the point is, a $100,000 ad buy on Facebook may be a drop in the bucket in terms of Facebook's overall revenue, but can still be effective.

 Wealth managers are helping high net-worth individuals rake in huge and increasing investment returns — and that trend could well continue with the potential entrance of big technology firms into the investment advisory space.
 ""No one knows yet what the future holds. Will Google and Facebook want to come in?"" David Wilson, head of Asia wealth management at financial advisory Capgemini Global Financial Services, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
However, the future of wealth management will ""absolutely be based on artificial intelligence,"" he said. 
 And that's exactly the tech giants' game.
""The depth of data that they have ... their retailing experience, their social experience, and being able to blend that to put very customized propositions in place"" could meet high net-worth individuals' demand for quality wealth advisory, according to Wilson.

Superyachts and other smaller luxury vessels sit moored in the Port de Fontvieille in Monaco, on Monday, May 18, 2015.
 But that does not mean that the sector will be fully automated, he said. While technology can help meet the demand for quality financial advice, high net-worth clients are demanding more than just great returns — and that's where the human touch comes in, according to Wilson.
High net-worth individuals have seen ""astronomical returns"" on portfolios overseen by wealth managers, Wilson said. According to a World Wealth Report by Capgemini this week, asset managers of wealthy clients reaped returns of 24.3 percent on average. In Asia, excluding Japan, those returns were at 33.0 percent.
The magnitude of those returns is surprising even as investors have, at large, profited from the year's global rally, Wilson said. According to the report, over half of high net-worth individuals said they were open to having their wealth managed by big tech firms like Google and Facebook.
Major tech giants have hinted about moving into financial services and some have already moved into the mobile payments space. Facebook was not immediately available for comment when asked about any future plans by CNBC. Google declined to comment.
Despite asset managers' expectation-beating results on investments, high net-worth clients said that they were only ""modestly satisfied"" with the performance of their advisers, Wilson said.
""The big reason, I believe, is the lack of personalization in some instances of the experience,"" he said, adding that the ideal model would be a hybrid that blends ""the best of digital and personalization, with the ability to tap into the human advisor in a more modular way.""

 ""I just woke up to the terrible news out of Las Vegas. Death is an inevitable part of life and happens for so many reasons that we can't avoid,"" writes Sandberg, whose husband unexpectedly passed away in 2015. ""But for people to be killed so senselessly, for lives to be lost so unnecessarily, is devastating for all of these families and for all of us."" 
 At least 58 people are dead and more than 500 have been injured in the deadliest shooting in U.S. history, after a gunman opened fire at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival across the road from the Mandalay Bay hotel on Sunday night.
 ""My heart goes out to the people of Las Vegas, to the friends and families of those we lost today and to everyone around the world who has lost someone to hate and violence,"" Sandberg writes.
Another prominent leader in tech responded to the violence, too. Billionaire tech investor Mark Cuban tweeted his sympathies.

 There have been hundreds of mass shootings in the United States already in 2017, and in the wake of especially large and public mass shootings, there is often renewed anger over the gun laws in the United States. Zuckerberg does not explicitly mention a need to tighten access to guns in the U.S.
Zuckerberg says that Facebook has activated its Safety Check feature, a crisis response tool allowing people to check in identifying themselves as safe and for others to check in on friends and loved ones who may have been in the area at the time of the tragedy.

 A Facebook page designed to let users check on the safety of friends and family during a crisis also showed graphic videos of the Las Vegas massacre, showing the challenge the company faces in keeping unwanted content off its site while also protecting users' freedom of speech.
 Some of the videos — posted by individual Facebook users and a broad range of national media organizations, including CNN, ABC News, NBC News and the Washington Post — included warnings that they contained graphic or disturbing images.
Facebook created its Safety Check service in 2014 to give users a way to communicate their status to loved ones in the wake of a natural disaster, mass shooting or other deadly event.
 Yet early Monday, a section of the page devoted to the mass shooting in Las Vegas contained posts showing bloody bodies lying in a parking lot and scenes of panic as concertgoers tried to flee to safety while a gunman opened fire from a nearby hotel.
The video content on what is now the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history adds to evidence that the company may be on a collision course with those who say it must do more to keep such content off its site.
 Facebook already faces growing pressure in Congress for a full accounting of political ads bought by Russian groups trying to influence the 2016 U.S. election.
The company said last month it would turn the ads over to Congress and increase transparency of all political ads.
On Monday, Facebook said it had done so and also would hire an additional 1,000 workers to police ads on its site.
In Europe, meanwhile, the company faces tougher new laws, after leaders accused it of helping terrorists by hosting recruiting and propaganda videos.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made clear that while the company is committed to doing more to prevent the use of the site for nefarious purposes, it is unable to prevent all such instances of disturbing or misleading content.
In a Sept. 21 post, Zuckerberg also questioned whether stopping every piece of content from appearing on Facebook is compatible with protections enshrined in the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment:
""Now, I'm not going to sit here and tell you we're going to catch all bad content in our system. We don't check what people say before they say it, and frankly, I don't think our society should want us to. Freedom means you don't have to ask permission first, and that by default you can say what you want.""

 Russian-bought Facebook ads could have reached millions of voters   
 4:11  PM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 |  00:55 
 Facebook said roughly 10 million people saw advertisements bought by Russian groups trying to influence the 2016 U.S. election, the first time the company has shared the reach and potential impact of such ads.
 Facebook also said it's ""possible"" that there are more such ads that it hasn't yet found.
The company released the details on some 3,000 ads the same day they sent them to Congressional committee members in the House and Senate, who are looking at how Russian agents tried to sway last year's Presidential election.
 Some of the ads were paid for in Russian currency, Facebook said in a statement.
The company has been asked to appear at public hearings by three different committees in coming weeks to give details on the Russian ad campaign, which highlighted hot-button, divisive issues such as race to try and sway voters.
Facebook admitted in its statement there are limits to its ability to stop people from using its site to undermine democracy.
""Even when we have taken all steps to control abuse, there will be political and social content that will appear on our platform that people will find objectionable, and that we will find objectionable. We permit these messages because we share the values of free speech,"" the company's statement said.
Facebook has faced mounting criticism in Washington about its response to the propaganda and misinformation Russia-based organizations placed on its site.
Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has said he intends to introduce a bill that will remove an exemption for online political ads that have previously shielded their buyers from public scrutiny.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg late last year had said it was ""crazy"" to think that the site he founded was used that way. 
On Sept. 21, however, Zuckerberg apologized for that comment and said the company was committed to stopping foreign governments from influencing U.S. elections.
""Now, I wish I could tell you we're going to be able to stop all interference, but that wouldn't be realistic. There will always be bad people in the world, and we can't prevent all governments from all interference. But we can make it harder. We can make it a lot harder. And that's what we're going to do,"" Zuckerberg said in his post last month.

 Twitter has continued to allow a Russian government-supported news network to advertise on its platform, even though the tech company sounded alarms about its ads to lawmakers investigating the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 presidential election.
In a meeting with House and Senate investigators last week, Twitter executives shared more than 1,800 promoted tweets from Russia Today, known as RT, and its three main accounts on the site. Some of the ads, valued in total at about $274,000, sought to promote RT's own stories, including those that sharply attacked Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Twitter's decision to share that information with Congress followed a report by the U.S. government's top intelligence agencies, which slammed RT in January as the ""Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet."" Despite those concerns, though, the news network's three Twitter accounts -- @RT_com, @RT_America and @ActualidadRT — remain fully operational. And Twitter has not banned RT from advertising, according to a source familiar with the matter.
 A spokeswoman for Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Facebook, meanwhile, similarly has not shut down RT's official pages, one of which boasts more than 4.5 million followers. Nor has Facebook targeted any new advertising restrictions against the news network, a spokesman for the social giant told Recode, before adding they are monitoring the situation. Facebook nonetheless finds itself in congressional crosshairs for  Russian-sponsored misinformation circulated in posts and advertisements before Election Day.
Google is still reviewing its platform for potential Russian interference. So far, it has not yet announced any findings or steps to harden its review process, and a spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. But RT videos had been viewed about 800 million times on Google-owned YouTube between the video platform's founding in 2005 and the U.S. government's January 2017 analysis of the election.
In many ways, though, Twitter's actions serve to illustrate the biggest dilemma facing the whole of Silicon Valley in combating misinformation spread by Russia or other malefactors online. Like many social networks, Twitter's service is global in nature, so any attempt to battle back sources or ideas — even those that frustrate U.S. users and regulators alike — could be seen as censorship here or elsewhere.
Last week, RT sharply criticized Twitter for even turning over copies of its advertisements to lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In a snarky-worded statement, the publication's editor in chief, Margarita Simonyan, stressed that ""similar campaigns are conducted by the American media in the Russian segment of Twitter,"" before adding: ""It'll be very interesting to find out how much they spend on it, who they target and for what purpose.""
A spokesperson for RT did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
For Twitter and its peers, they could face further questions about its handling of RT and other Russia-tied accounts in a matter of weeks. The company has been invited along with Facebook and Google to testify in front of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, which are set to hold hearings on the 2016 election in October and November, respectively.
Entering that hearing, Facebook has revealed that 470 accounts with connections to the Kremlin purchased about 3,000 ads, some of which  sought to stoke political discord around controversial issues like race, religion and gun control. Those ads have been turned over to congressional investigators as well as Robert Mueller, the former FBI director who's leading an independent probe into the 2016 election.
Some of those  same suspicious accounts on Facebook, however, also have ties to another 200 accounts on Twitter, a realization it shared with congressional investigators last week. But Twitter — as it turned over information about those users as well as RT's ads — quickly drew the ire of lawmakers like Sen. Mark Warner and Rep. Adam Schiff, who charged that the company should have looked more exhaustively at its records to determine the extent of Russian meddling.
Twitter, for its part, stressed it already has in place ""stricter policies for advertising campaigns on Twitter than we do for organic content.""
""We also have existing specific policies and review mechanisms for campaign ads, but will examine them with an eye to improving them,"" the company continued in its blog post last week. ""We welcome the opportunity to work with the FEC and leaders in Congress to review and strengthen guidelines for political advertising on social media.""
For its part, the U.S. government's own 2017 report on the election repeatedly slammed RT as the ""Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet."" The news network had partnered with Wikileaks, for example, which had published hacked emails from the Clinton campaign, potentially with official Russian support, according to the Director of National Intelligence's findings. And RT ran a number of negative, accusatory stories about Clinton personally, at one point suggesting she and ISIS were funded by the same sources.

People stand behind police barrier tape outside the Luxor hotel Obelisk and the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, following a mass shooting at the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas, Nevada, October 2, 2017.
 Facebook and Google are facing fresh criticism for failing to hold back the tide of fake news online, as the aftermath of the mass shooting in Las Vegas once again revealed shortcomings in their algorithms.
Early on Monday the two leading online media companies helped showcase inaccurate reports that wrongly identified a man with strong leftwing leanings as being connected to the killings. The reports circulated on rightwing news sites before slipping through the automated filters used by Facebook and Google.
 Both companies said the problems were short-lived and they were working to fix the failures but not before exposing themselves to a new round of criticism for not doing enough to prevent the spread of false and damaging information.
“There’s a way — the fact is, they don’t have the will,” said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University and author of The Four, a new book about Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. He said the recent hiring of more staff to identify and remove false information was too limited to have an effect: “It’s pi**ing in the ocean — it’s a series of half measures.”
For Facebook, already under intense political pressure over the use of its network by Russian operatives during the US election, the latest slip has come at a difficult time. The misinformation, spread by a site called Alt-Right, appeared on Facebook’s “Safety Check” page, which people use to make sure their friends and family are safe after a crisis.
Facebook said the offending post was spotted by its global security operations centre but that “its removal was delayed by a few minutes”. In that time, it added, the post was “screen-captured and circulated online”.
The social networking company did not explain how its algorithms had allowed the fake information to be posted. “We are working to fix the issue that allowed this to happen in the first place and deeply regret the confusion this caused,” it said.
In Google’s case, a search for the name of the man wrongly accused of the shootings brought up a page of search results topped by three prominent boxes labelled “Top Stories”. One of these was a post from 4Chan, a site known for its online hoaxes and misinformation, which contained the false claim.
Google’s Top Stories are drawn both from its News service, which has some degree of curation, and from a general web search. The 4Chan result was drawn from the web.
While Facebook manually removed its post, Google said the 4Chan post was “algorithmically replaced”, and that this had taken “hours” from the time it first appeared. To protect itself from accusations of subjectively favouring some search results over others, Google relies on the weight of “good information” to drive out the bad from its results, or making changes to its algorithms that affect all searches equally.
“This should not have appeared for any queries and we’ll continue to make algorithmic improvements to prevent this from happening in the future,” Google said.
Meanwhile, Twitter also came under fire on Monday after a user posted a screenshot of a search that returned a result from Infowars, a site frequently criticised for peddling conspiracy theories, as the top result. The post reported a claim from militant Islamist group Isis that it was behind the Las Vegas shootings.
Though Isis had made the claim, reporting its statement without pointing out that it was unsubstantiated was seriously misleading for readers, said Dan Gillmor, a digital media expert who teaches at Arizona State University. “If a responsible news organisation is going to mention it, it should be in context,” he said.
Twitter was unable to say how many users saw the search result, but said the personalisation in its system meant that people who searched for the same thing often saw different results.

 We are letting Amazon and Apple 'avoid taxes, invade privacy, and destroy jobs,' says NYU professor   
 1:32  PM ET Tue,  3 Oct 2017 |  00:46 
 Scott Galloway is one angry guy.  He's a professor at the NYU Stern School of Business, where he teaches brand strategy and digital marketing, and he's the founder of consulting firm L2. Galloway has become a bit of a media star recently on his (accurate) prediction that Amazon should consider buying Whole Foods.  You might think his new book, ""The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google,"" out Tuesday, would be an admiring examination of how these companies came to dominate the world.  On one level, it is. He explains how the tech giants have succeeded in exerting influence over our attention, our loyalty and our personal information.  ""Facebook and Google own media; Apple owns the phone; and Amazon is about to molest the entire retail ecosystem,"" he says.  Fair enough, but that's not really what Galloway has set out to do. Galloway is upset, really upset, at what he says these companies are getting away with: ""These companies avoid taxes, invade privacy and destroy jobs to increase profits because ... they can.""  He's angry that the ""Four Horsemen"" — as he calls them — employ only 418,000 employees, about the population of Minneapolis, but they have a combined stock market value ($2.3 trillion) that is roughly the GDP of France, a developed nation of 67 million citizens.  He's angry that these companies create growth without prosperity. He knows that many people tend to blame global trade and immigrants for our problems, but he insists the tech economy and its ""fetishization"" is equally to blame: ""It's dangerous for our society, and it shows no signs of slowing down. It hollows out the middle class, which leads to bankrupt towns, feeds the angry politics of those who feel cheated, and underpins the rise of demagogues.""  It's not just that he doesn't like what these companies are doing. He also doesn't particularly like a lot of the people who run these companies. Doubt me? Here's a sample:  On the obsession with Apple founder Steve Jobs: ""Steve Jobs, in my view, spat on the universe. ... The world needs more homes with engaged parents, not a better ... phone.""  On Apple's tax history: ""Apple is the largest tax avoider in the history of U.S. business.""  On the parallels between Google and Microsoft: ""Microsoft at its peak was notorious for having the most insufferable a------ employees in American business.""  On why rich people are easier to sell to because they're all basically alike: ""Rich people are more homogenous than any other cohort on Earth. ... The global elite, by contrast, is a rainbow of the same damn color."" On what Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos should really be doing with his company: ""What's clear is that we need business leaders who envision, and enact, a future with more jobs — not billionaires who want the government to fund, with taxes they avoid, social programs for people to sit on their couches and watch Netflix all day."" Gee, thanks Scott. What is this? New Progressive? Intellectual Populism? Old-fashioned trust busting? Trump-era name calling?
 Amazon declined comment on Galloway's book. Apple did not immediately return a call for comment.  In a phone interview, Galloway describes himself as an ""irreverent progressive,"" telling me, ""I'm a capitalist, but I'm smart enough to realize that idolatry of these firms are not going to take care of us when we are old. They are just here to make a profit. ""  And what's wrong with that? Nothing, he insists, but then goes on: ""We reward them with characteristics associated with kindness and generosity,"" none of which is true, he says. ""They are being given the mother of all hall passes. We think these companies are progressive, when their behavior is more like Darth Vader crossed with Ayn Rand.""  Galloway is seizing on a new zeitgeist that is starting to emerge, a new narrative about these companies, one that switches from gushing admiration to a more critical viewpoint of their impact on the rest of the world, what exactly we have all given up to them, and what we have really received in return.  Do they deserve such criticism? Galloway argues that their sheer size and influence demands that we be more critical toward them. Let's just focus on Amazon for the moment. He is amazed at:  1) The trust Amazon's consumer shows toward Amazon: ""Amazon's customers trust it so much that they're allowing the company to listen in on their conversations and harvest their consumption data. This will give Amazon deeper penetration into the private lives and desires of consumers than any other company.""  2) The way Wall Street gives a pass to Amazon: ""Amazon has trained the Street to hold them to a different standard — to expect higher growth but lower profits.""  3) The stunning success of Amazon Prime: ""Prime members represent recurring revenue, loyalty and annual purchases that are 40 percent greater than non-Prime members.""  4) How Amazon has made shipping the pillar of its success: ""In 2015, Amazon spent $7 billion on shipping fees, a net shipping loss of $5 billion, and overall profits of $2.4 billion. Crazy, no?""  Not crazy, of course. A critical key to Amazon's success was the development of the world's most efficient physical distribution network. Lower costs, greater selection, faster delivery. Get to more and more households in less and less time.  Galloway's conclusion: Amazon is on a path to a trillion-dollar market cap (currently at $460 billion), through a combination of acquisitions, a further push into the last-mile delivery chain and opening more stores. Galloway spends considerable time explaining this oddity, why Amazon, the store killer, will expand into bricks and mortar: ""Because e-commerce doesn't work, isn't economically viable, and no pure e-commerce firm will survive long term.""  What's Amazon's next move? Galloway got considerable buzz a short while ago when he suggested that Nordstrom would be a logical acquisition (they are in talks to go private). But he suggests they are so big they could buy almost anything: ""My bet is Amazon buys the rights to broadcast March Madness or the Super Bowl to juice their Prime membership ... as they can.""  The real move to get them to a $1 trillion market cap, Galloway predicts, will be in artificial intelligence: ""If Amazon tests an AI-like offering anticipating all your retail needs — sending stuff automatically and calibrating based on what you send back or edit via voice ... the stock will become antigravity matter and triple to a trillion dollars in value.""  What about the competition? Is it all over for retail? No, Galloway says. He cites a small group of innovators — Sephora, Home Depot, Best Buy — that are investing in people and a strong in-store experience.

 Russian-bought Facebook ads could have reached millions of voters   
 4:11  PM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 |  00:55 
 Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg was initially dismissive of the idea that fake news disseminated by ""advertisers"" via Facebook had any outcome on the U.S. presidential election. But now, he and the social media giant are clearly changing their tune.
 Zuckerberg apologized recently for dismissing concerns that Facebook impacted the campaign as crazy:
 ""After the election, I made a comment that I thought the idea misinformation on Facebook changed the outcome of the election was a crazy idea. Calling that crazy was dismissive and I regret it. This is too important an issue to be dismissive."" 
 Facebook released to Congress and the general public on Monday details about 3,000 ads bought by Russian groups that it estimates 10 million people saw during the course of the 2016 election. That came after Facebook admitted that it sold about $100,000 in political ads from fake accounts from Russia and  Zuckerberg promised to do something to stop this from happening again.
The fact that he is changing his tune now could be due to one very serious fear factor: The prospect of regulation.
Think about it: Dozens of politicians and much of the news media have committed a great deal of the last several months working the nation up into a frenzy over the alleged Russian collusion with the Trump campaign and overall Russian election tampering in 2016. With the still slim odds of special prosecutor Robert Mueller finding any direct evidence of a Trump-Russian election conspiracy, that angry mob is going to want someone's hide over this, and it might very well be Facebook's and some other social media companies as well.
The way they would get that ""hide"" wouldn't be by firing, imprisonment or anything like that. Rather, it would be through increased regulation.
Facebook and some of its social media counterparts are essentially news broadcasters in every practical sense. In fact, Facebook is the mother of all news sites with more than 1.3 billion active users according to its own measurements. You could combine the daily circulation of every newspaper in America with the daily viewer totals of every cable and broadcast newscast and not come close to that number. And, just as importantly, Facebook users are much more engaged with the stories they're seeing on the site — commenting and ""liking"" with regularity — than old fashioned newspaper readers and TV news viewers.
Well before the Russia scandal or the election, those big user numbers made Facebook a likely target for the same kind of regulation established news media companies have worked under for decades. And Facebook investors have rightfully feared those kinds of rules for a long time, because following them requires a lot more time and money than Facebook has clearly bothered to put in to vetting its advertisers. That new regulation fear is bubbling up right now and has become a subject of a  furious bull vs. bear debate over Facebook stock.
We could go on for hours about all of the rules that TV networks and local stations have to follow that social media sites don't. But let's just focus on the key rules surrounding the broadcasting of political ads that even the smallest local station has to follow and the multi-billion dollar cash cow Facebook does not. Any request from any source to purchase ad time dealing with a federal candidate has to be put in the station's political file, which is open to public inspection. And here's the information about the ad request that needs to be in that file: (These are all according to the FCC guidebook):
 The name of the group sponsoring the ad The group's principal officers or directors Whether the request to buy time was accepted or rejected The class of time purchased The rate charged The name of the candidates the ad refers to The exact time the spots ran 
These can be challenging rules to follow for even a small broadcaster with only a limited number of hours per day to monitor and ad time to sell. Now multiply that by 1.32 billion personalized Facebook feeds and you can just start to fathom the Herculean task Zuckerberg and co. would face if they were subjected to just two or three of these requirements.
So it's not so much that Facebook is worried that it will be implicated in an as yet unproven conspiracy theory about the Trump election victory. What it appears to be trying to stave off now is the much more likely moment when enough bipartisan powers that be in Washington suddenly realize it's time to treat the company like its broadcast predecessors and put it fully under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission.
And campaign ads are just one relatively small part of this equation. There's already been a loud alarm sounded by traditional newspapers and some online news sites that have been complaining for some time that Google and Facebook are essentially a monopoly that  controls 61 percent of the $73 billion digital advertising industry.
And with a president in Donald Trump who has already publicly stated he believes Facebook is stacked against him, the justified fear factor in Menlo Park is probably at an all-time high.
Far be it from this conservative to advocate more regulation, but having what is essentially the world's largest news site operating virtually unregulated while all of its competitors are buried under heavy rules is intolerable.
Either Facebook should have to follow the same rules as NBC, The New York Times, and Politico, or just about all the rules should be scrapped for everyone. Facebook's release of a handful of shady Russian ads to Congress doesn't change that. And more people in Washington are beginning to realize it.

 Oath, the new digital advertising and media company that combines AOL and Yahoo, has a monstrous challenge ahead.
 Google and Facebook control almost two-thirds of the online ad market, according to eMarketer. Verizon -- the parent of Oath -- is stuck below 5 percent and in a tie for third with Microsoft.
Beyond trying to track down two of the world's most valuable companies, Oath has to overcome Yahoo's recent data breaches, which further damaged an already troubled reputation. Yahoo's platform has also been accused of high levels of ad fraud by its customers, with sources previously telling CNBC that ads didn't run in the right place and many of the viewers were actually bots.
 But Oath is talking a big game. 
By merging its disparate ad platforms and expanding its media properties in Latin America, Asia and Europe, the company plans to double its reach to 2 billion people in the next three to five years. It's also working with third parties to provide more transparency in telling marketers where their ads are running.
John DeVine, Oath's chief revenue officer, expects those efforts to result in major market share gains.
""We want to move the ball forward around the theme of trust, and we don't want to stop at number three,"" DeVine told CNBC.

 Oath recently launched its first global advertising campaign called #BuildYourBrand to reintroduce AOL and Yahoo as one company to advertisers and the public. The companies were acquired by Verizon in 2015 and 2017, respectively.
In aiming to reach more of the projected 5 billion internet users worldwide by 2020, Oath is emphasizing mobile experiences, DeVine said. It's focusing on sports, news and finance coverage and going heavy on original video, especially sports and live events. Verizon had the exclusive rights to the first London NFL game this September. The company plans to acquire more concerts and international sports and is evaluating the rights to cricket matches.
Tim Mahlman, Oath's president and head of programmatic ad tech platforms, said there's also an opportunity to provide production facilities and license syndicated video to Oath's media partners.
""We have the tools between our two companies that allow us to take video content and expand it out to where it isn't today,"" Mahlman said.
As for the data breaches, DeVine called it an ""industry problem"" and pointed to the latest hack involving Equifax. He said that following Yahoo's two major hacks last year, the company was able to rebuild its relationships with users rather quickly.
""We're all going to continue to fight this together,"" DeVine said. ""We feel like were on a very good trust footing with our consumers, and we're going to continue to earn that every day.""

 Facebook launched Facebook Messenger Lite for Android in the U.S. this week.
 Facebook Messenger Lite originally made its debut in emerging smartphone markets where data networks are slower than what's offered by most U.S. carriers. The Lite version, however, measures just 10MB in size — which means it won't take up too much storage on your phone — and is watered-down as to not hog data each month.
If your kids are constantly going over their data limits, you might want to think about installing the new version. It still offers plenty of features, such as the ability to chat with groups of friends, and send photos and videos. It just happens to use less data and will work even if you're not on a faster cellular connection.
 The app is available for Android only. Google has posted instructions here.

 Tech's four horsemen more like Darth Vader or Ayn Rand: NYU's Scott Galloway   
 9:17  AM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  01:22 
 The following is an excerpt from ""The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google"" (Oct. 3, 2017, Portfolio) by Scott Galloway:
 Firms try to build higher and higher walls to keep enemies (upstarts and competitors) from invasion. Business theorists call these structures ""barriers to entry.""
They are nice in theory, but increasingly traditional walls are showing cracks, even crumbling — especially in tech. The plummeting price of processing power (Moore's Law again), coupled with an increase in bandwidth and a new generation of leadership that has digital in their DNA, has produced bigger ladders than anyone ever expected. ESPN, J.Crew, and Jeb Bush . . . all unassailable, no? No. Digital ladders (over-the-top video, fast fashion, and @therealdonaldtrump) can vault almost any wall.
 So, what's a ridiculously successful firm to do? Malcolm Gladwell, the Jesus of business books, highlights the parable of David & Goliath to make the key point: don't fight on other people's terms. In other words, once you've made the jump to light speed as a tech firm, you need to immunize yourself from the same conquering weapons your own army levied on the befuddled prey. There are several obvious examples: network effects (everyone is on Facebook because . . . everyone's on Facebook); IP protection (every firm in tech over $10 billion is suing, and being sued by, every other $10 billion tech firm), and developing an industry standard—monopoly—ecosystem (typing this on Word because I have no choice).
However, I'd argue that digging deeper moats is the real key to long-term success.
The iPhone will not be the best phone for long. Too many firms are struggling to catch up. However, there is a key asset of Apple Inc. that has a stronger immune system: its 492 retail stores in 19 countries. Wait, a marauder could just put up an online store, no? No. HP.com vs. the Apple Regent Street Store in London is like bringing a (butter) knife to a gunfight. And even if Samsung decides to allocate the capital, nine women can't have a baby in a month and the Korean giant would need a decade (at least) to present a similar offering.
Brick and mortar's troubles have been laid at the feet of digital disruption. There is some truth to that. However, digital sales are still only 10–12 percent of retail. It's not stores that are dying, but the middle class, and the stores serving them. Most that are located in, or serving, middle-class households are struggling. By comparison, stores in affluent neighborhoods are holding strong. The middle class used to be 61 percent of Americans, now they are the minority, representing less than half the population . . . the rest being lower or upper income.
 So, Apple, recognizing that ladders will keep getting taller, opted for more analog (time/ capital expensive) moats. Google and Samsung are both coming for Apple. But they are more likely to produce a better phone than to replicate the romance, connection, and general awesomeness of Apple's stores. So, every successful firm in the digital age needs to ask: In addition to big, tall walls, where can I build deep moats? That is, old-economy barriers that are expensive and take a long time to dredge (and for competitors to cross). Apple has done this superbly, continually investing in the world's best brand, and in stores. Amazon, also is going for moats, erecting a hundred-plus expensive and slow‑to‑get-built warehouses. How old economy! A good bet is Amazon will open thousands before they are done.
Recently Amazon announced leases on twenty 767s and purchased thousands of Amazon-branded tractor-trailers. Google has server farms, and is launching early twentieth-century aviation technology (blimps) into the atmosphere that will beam broadband down to Earth. Facebook, among the Four Horsemen, has the fewest old-economy moats, making it the most vulnerable to an invading army with big-ass ladders. You can expect that to change as Facebook announced they, along with Microsoft, are laying cable across the floor of the Atlantic.
The success of single companies like Apple can hollow out entire markets, even regions. The iPhone debuted in 2007, and devastated Motorola and Nokia. Together they have shed 100,000 jobs. Nokia, at its peak, represented 30 percent of Finland's GDP and paid almost a quarter of all of that country's corporate taxes. Russia may have rolled tanks into Finland in 1939, but Apple's 2007 commercial invasion also levied substantial economic damage. Nokia's fall pummeled the entire economy of Finland. The firm's share of the stock market has shrunk from 70 to 13 percent.

Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg are unlikely to testify before Congress early next month, when Facebook will face a grilling on how Russia-based groups used the company's ad-buying technology to influence the 2016 U.S. election, a source familiar with the situation told CNBC.
 While the company hasn't finalized who will represent Facebook at a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee on that date, it probably won't be either of its top two executives, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because a final decision has yet to be made.
Instead, Zuckerberg and Sandberg are expected to be on a conference call with investors and Wall Street analysts that afternoon to discuss the company's third-quarter results, as is typical.

 Facebook, Google, Twitter asked to testify on Russian meddling   
 9:07  AM ET Thu, 28 Sept 2017 |  00:59 
 Facebook said Wednesday it will release its quarterly financial report and hold its usual earnings call after the close of U.S. stock markets on Wednesday, Nov. 1.
That's the same date the company -- along with online ad rivals Google and Twitter -- has agreed to testify before the Senate committee on Russia's election-meddling.
Facebook said last month that groups based in Russia spent roughly $100,000 on more than 3,000 ads during the American Presidential campaign last year, and in the months afterward, to influence voters. Many of the ads highlighted divisive issues such as race and gun ownership and were targeted at key electoral battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida, according to reports.
On Monday, the company turned the ads over to Congress and said that 10 million people may have seen them.
When asked who is likely to testify for the company before Congress, the source declined to name any Facebook executives and instead pointed to a statement made by Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
On September 27, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said it wasn't important that Zuckerberg or another top Facebook executive show up for the hearing.
""I think it's more important that we get the person who's most capable of talking about the technical aspects of what they need to do to identify foreign money that may come in and what procedures, if any, need to be put in law that make sure elections are not intruded upon by foreign entities,"" Burr was quoted as saying.
As a result, the executive who testifies will likely be someone technical, said the Facebook source. One possbility: Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who wrote the blog post in September where Facebook first revealed the Russian spending on ads.

 Tech's four horsemen more like Darth Vader or Ayn Rand: NYU's Scott Galloway   
 9:17  AM ET Wed,  4 Oct 2017 |  01:22 
 The troubling ease in which Russia was able to buy thousands of political ads on Facebook in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election shows just how much influence major technology companies have amassed in modern-day America, NYU business school marketing professor and author Scott Galloway told CNBC on Wednesday.
 The notion that someone with a credit card ""can pay in rubles to start advertising and sowing chaos here is probably the tipping point,"" said Galloway, author of ""The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google."" The new book explores the sway big tech holds over consumer attention, loyalty and personal information.
Facebook on Monday said roughly 10 million people saw advertisements bought by Russian groups trying to influence the November election. The social network released those details as it turned over about 3,000 ads to House and Senate lawmakers.
 Special counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees are investigating possible links between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia, which both sides deny.
""The most innovative use of technology in 2017 was Russia weaponizing Facebook,"" Galloway said in a ""Squawk Box"" interview while discussing his book. ""The thing that's made it worse is the underreaction or half measures by Facebook, refusing to acknowledge, in my view, the important role that the fourth estate plays in our society.""
Facebook has been asked to appear at public hearings by three different committees in the coming weeks to give details on the Russian ad effort. The company said there are limits to its ability to stop people from using its site to undermine democracy.
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Galloway, a brand expert and founder of the RedEnvelope e-commerce firm, predicted in May that Amazon should consider buying Whole Foods, a month before the deal was announced. He said at the time he did not have any inside information and tweeted that he got ""lucky.""

 });A senator investigating Russia's role in the 2016 election wants to see social media companies make changes to ads to limit foreign influence in the future. 
 Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said platforms such as Facebook are starting to recognize the threat posed by nefarious use of social media. Divisive Facebook ads believed to be linked to Russia targeted specific parts of the United States last year, including states considered to be battlegrounds, according to NBC News. 
Warner said he wants top social media companies to make three tweaks to address the problems created by foreign-linked ads. He specifically named Facebook, Google and Twitter.
 He wants Americans seeing an ad to ""know whether the source of that ad was generated by foreign entities.""  Warner said users should know if a trending story is appearing because real users like it. Bots or false accounts — sometimes used by foreign intelligence services — could also make news appear as trending, he said.  The senator wants campaigns to be able to see social media ads run for or against them, as they can with television and radio ads.  
Warner made the comments as he and committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., updated reporters on the investigation into Russian efforts to influence the election and possible Trump campaign collusion with the Kremlin. The senators said they believe Moscow will keep trying to affect U.S. elections. Such an effort could use social media. 
The intelligence committee's staff has already interviewed representatives from Facebook. The company has turned over more than 3,000 ads believed to be linked to the Kremlin. 
Senators have invited Facebook, Google and Twitter officials to testify at a hearing on Nov. 1, Burr said. They expect company officials to attend. 
Warner and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., have said they are working on legislation to make political ads more transparent on social media. It would require companies to take more steps to ensure that foreign nationals do not directly or indirectly purchase political ads.

 Facebook's massive size makes it easy to 'manipulate': NY Magazine's Max Read   
 7:09  AM ET Thu,  5 Oct 2017 |  03:50 
 With 2 billion monthly active users and growing, Facebook could encompass one-third of the world's population by this time next year, according to New York magazine.
 In a cover story in the current issue, Senior Editor Max Read explores the influence of Facebook at a time when the social network is under fire for allowing Russian groups to buy thousands of ads in an attempt to influence the 2016 president election.
""It is Orwellian ... in a sense that it is a surveillance company. The business model is to monitor you, to gather your data, and to create advertising categories,"" Read said Thursday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""
 Last month, Zuckerberg commented on the Russian ads, saying, ""We are committed to rising to the occasion. Our sophistication in handling these threats is growing and improving quickly. We will continue working with the government to understand the full extent of Russian interference.""
In his article, Read writes that Facebook users are ""the single largest non-biologically sorted group of people on the planet after 'Christians' — and, growing consistently at around 17 percent year after year, it could surpass that group before the end of 2017.""
According to the latest Pew Research Center demographic analysis, Christians remained the largest religious group in the world in 2015, with 2.3 billion followers.
""I use Facebook. I love Facebook. I've been on it for a decade-plus. It is an amazing invention in terms of its ability to keep people connected,"" Read told CNBC.
""[But] when you have that many people on one website; getting news from it, sharing news on it, talking to one and other, it's very easy to manipulate,"" he said. He added that Facebook lacks the controls, and the government has yet to regulate it to ensure ""that accuracy, that responsibility is at the focus of the power.""
This kind of concern was also expressed by NYU business school marketing professor Scott Galloway in his new book, ""The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google."" Galloway told CNBC on Wednesday that the ease in which Russia, using a credit card, ""can pay in rubles to start advertising and sewing chaos here is probably the tipping point.""
As Facebook continues to expand, Read said he believes co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn't even know how get his arms around it. ""I think his heart is in the right place. I just think this thing has gotten so big that not even the nicest, not even a saint, could make it work for us.""
Facebook was not immediately available to address CNBC's request for comment.
Read said he's spoken to people who have met Zuckerberg on his 2017 challenge to himself to visit every U.S. state that he hadn't been to yet. There's been speculation that this type of tour might be a sign that he may want to seek political office, possibly the presidency.
""I feel pretty confident he's not planning on running for president,"" Read said, believing this tour is about research and development. ""I think he wants to meet with people who use Facebook to find out how they use it.""

 Facebook will start testing fake news warnings, adding context to the traditional news feed and constant sharing on its platform, the company announced Thursday. 
 ""This new feature is designed to provide people some of the tools they need to make an informed decision about which stories to read, share, and trust,"" the company said in a statement.
The new feature will allow Facebook users to tap a button for additional information about the news article and source, including details from the publisher's Wikipedia entry, trending and related content, and information about how the article is being shared. 
 Facebook has come under pressure in recent weeks to better combat the spread of fake news and misinformation. The social media giant said earlier this week that Russia-backed ads during the 2016 presidential election reached an estimated 10 million users. Fake news stories also circulated on the platform in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting. 
""We're making it easier to learn more about an article right in your Facebook news feed,"" Andrew Anker, product management director for news at Facebook said in a video about the announcement.
Distribution of content through Pages won't be affected, the company said.

 Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has announced that Facebook is set to invest over $1 billion in the U.S. state. 
 The tech giant will invest $750 million to construct a 970,000 square foot data center in Henrico County. In addition, it will spend hundreds of millions building ""multiple solar facilities"" to power the data center with renewable energy. 
""I am proud to welcome Facebook to Henrico County, and we look forward to a strong partnership,"" McAuliffe said in a statement.
Authorities said that the project would create thousands of construction jobs and 100 ""full-time"" operational roles.
Rachel Peterson, Facebook's director of data strategy, added: ""When considering new data center locations, we not only look for clean and renewable energy solutions, but great partnerships within the local community, a strong pool of local talent, excellent access to fiber, and a robust electric grid. Henrico County and the Commonwealth of Virginia has it all.""
Facebook has ambitious plans when it comes to sustainability and says it is committed to powering its business with 100 percent ""clean and renewable energy.""
The U.S. installed almost 2.4 gigawatts of solar photovoltaics in the second quarter of 2017, according to the U.S. Solar Market Insight report from GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association. The report, which was released in September, said this represented an increase of 8 percent year-on-year.

Brad Parscale, who was the Trump campaign's digital director, at Trump Tower in November 2016
 Parscale ended up becoming Trump's digital director, the man behind the social media advertising strategy that helped win the election. And that $1,500 project reaped massive rewards: His company ended up being paid $94 million, including the money spent on advertising during Trump's campaign.
The interview also revealed that staff from Facebook, Google and Twitter spent time working at Trump's campaign offices, collaborating with Parscale on reaching potential voters.
""I asked each one of them by email, (I said:) 'I want to know every single secret button, click, technology you have, I want to know everything you would tell Hillary's campaign plus some and I want your people here to teach me how to use it,'"" he told CBS.
""I would ask them to be Republicans and I would talk to them. I wanted people who supported Donald Trump from their companies.""
Trump's customized Facebook ads
Parscale created highly targeted Facebook advertising, testing each one to see which would receive the most clicks. ""We were making hundreds of thousands of them (ads on Facebook) programmatically. … (On an) average day (we would make) 50,000 to 60,000 ads, … changing language, words, colors, changing things because certain people like a green button better than a blue button, some people like the word 'donate' over 'contribute.'""
Trump himself has accused Facebook of being against him, via Twitter. But Parscale claimed that Trump's election campaign used social media tools ""better than anyone ever had in history.""

 Brad Parscale: Trump team used Facebook to help win the White House   
 4:41  PM ET Mon,  9 Oct 2017 |  00:49 
 The Trump campaign's digital director credits Facebook in helping to fuel the president's surprising win last November. 
 In an interview with CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" that aired Sunday, Brad Parscale said Facebook ""was the method"" for President Donald Trump's stunning rise to the White House. Parscale, who spearheaded the small Trump campaign team's digital and fundraising efforts, contended that the team took advantage of Facebook in a way Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign did not. 
""Facebook now lets you get to places and places possibly that you would never go with TV ads,"" Parscale, web director at San Antonio-based marketing and design firm Giles Parscale, told CBS. ""Now, I can find, you know, 15 people in the Florida Panhandle that I would never buy a TV commercial for. And, we took opportunities that I think the other side didn't.""
 He pointed to the Trump campaign having Facebook employees ""embedded inside our offices"" to explain how to use the platform to target voters. Parscale wanted Trump-supporting Facebook employees to offer guidance, and the company already had divisions ""set up"" by political affiliation, he said. 
Parscale said he ""heard"" Clinton's campaign got the same offer but did not accept it. 
In a statement, Facebook said it offered the campaigns ""identical support"" and had teams assigned to both Trump and Clinton. ""Everyone had access to the same tools,"" the company said, adding that it did not let campaigns ""hand pick"" employees or assign its workers full time to Trump or Clinton. 
""Both campaigns approached things differently and used different amounts of support,"" Facebook said. 
CNBC could not immediately reach former Clinton campaign officials for comment. 
Parscale also says the Trump campaign's focus on infrastructure policy gave it an advantage. As a candidate, Trump repeatedly pledged to pass a spending package to rebuild American roads, bridges and airports. 
""It was voters in the Rust Belt that cared about their roads being rebuilt, their highways, their bridges. They felt like the world was crumbling. So I started making ads that would show the bridge crumbling,"" Parscale said. ""You know, that's microtargeting them. Because I can find the 1,500 people in one town that care about infrastructure. Now, that might be a voter that normally votes Democrat."" Hesays his company got paid $94 million for its work on the campaign.
Parscale, as part of the Trump campaign's push to target voters, has also faced questions about possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. U.S. intelligence services have said the Kremlin orchestrated a campaign to influence the election, partly fueled by politically charged ads on Facebook. 
Parscale told CBS he ""would not want a foreign entity to meddle in our election."" He called it a ""farce"" to say that he, personally, had any role in cooperating with the Kremlin.

CNBC poll: 64% of households own Apple products  ","Facebook 2017
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg used the ""Spaces"" virtual reality product to transport his 3-D avatar to hurricane-hit Puerto Rico.
 Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg apologized on Tuesday for offending some users, after he posted a video on Monday demonstrating Facebook features against the backdrop of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico.
 Zuckerberg was called a ""heartless billionaire"" and accused of ""exploiting disaster"" by online users after live-streaming a virtual reality (VR) cartoon avatar of himself in hurricane-hit Puerto Rico.  In his apology, Zuckerberg said it was designed to ""raise awareness"" of what's happening around the world and spotlight Facebook's work with the Red Cross.
Last month, Puerto Rico was badly hit by Hurricane Maria. Electricity is almost non-existent and millions of citizens are struggling without basic necessities, including water.
 Zuckerberg demonstrated Facebook Spaces on Monday, a product that allows users to create a 3-D virtual avatar of themselves to use with an Oculus Rift VR headset. It lets people to communicate with each other by putting their avatars in the same virtual space.
 ""One of the things that's really magical about virtual reality, is you can get the feeling that you're really in a place.""
-Mark Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook
 The Facebook boss was ""virtually"" transported to Puerto Rico with Rachel Franklin, the head of social VR at the company. 
In the video on his Facebook page, Zuckerberg said: ""One of the things that's really magical about virtual reality, is you can get the feeling that you're really in a place.""
Franklin followed up and said: ""Crazy to feel like you're in the middle of it.""
 The comments and the entire video were repeatedly slammed by users on social media.
 TWEET
 One user on Facebook, Rosaida Castro, commented on the video on Zuckerberg's page and said: ""Is this a joke? The Puerto Ricans are suffering and you are using our tragedy for this?? Heartless billionaire.""
Other users said Zuckerberg was engaging in ""voyeuristic tourism.""
Another user Paul Rickett said Zuckerberg ""can't let a good tragedy go to waste. He has to promote Facebook. Typical. All he talks about (is) Facebook instead of victims and their suffering."" 
In a comment on his post, Zuckerberg wrote:  ""One of the most powerful features of VR is empathy. My goal here was to show how VR can raise awareness and help us see what's happening in different parts of the world. I also wanted to share the news of our partnership with the Red Cross to help with the recovery. Reading some of the comments, I realize this wasn't clear, and I'm sorry to anyone this offended.""
Zuckerberg's reaction to the disaster stands in contrast to that of another high-profile tech innovator, Elon Musk. The CEO of Tesla last week proposed rebuilding Puerto Rico's electricity infrastructure using solar systems.
Some people who watched Zuckerberg's video praised his efforts in VR, as well as Facebook's assistance to those affected by Hurricane Maria. 
The Facebook CEO talked about features like Safety Check, which allows users on the social network to mark themselves safe when a natural disaster hits. He also said the company had donated over $1.5 million to the relief efforts in Puerto Rico. 
Zuckerberg also said the company is using artificial intelligence to map the population in Puerto Rico to help the Red Cross identify areas most in need of help.

 Oculus unveils new 'Go'   
 7:14  PM ET Wed, 11 Oct 2017 |  01:30 
 Facebook dropped $2 billion to acquire virtual reality platform Oculus in 2014.
 Unlike the company's other big acquisitions, Instagram ($1 billion in 2012) and WhatsApp ($19 billion in 2014), Oculus does not appear to be paying off.  
Although Oculus Gear VR headsets are practically handed out with Samsung smartphones, the company's more expensive Oculus Rift platform doesn't appear to have attracted any real following. According to market research firm Canalys, Facebook sold fewer than 400,000 units of the Oculus Rift last year, making it less popular than the competing HTC Vive and Sony PlayStation VR, the latter of which has already shipped more than 1 million units. 
 Anecdotally, it doesn't seem to be a hit either. I don't know anyone outside of the technology industry who owns one. I review gadgets and have a house full of toys, and yet I haven't found any need to buy one. I know people who own the PlayStation VR.
 David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images
 Facebook has never disclosed sales figures, but based on announcements at today's annual Oculus Connect event, it's still searching for the right combo of features and price that will make Oculus a hit. 
 The Oculus Go
 Facebook on Wednesday introduced the $199 Oculus Go, a virtual reality headset that will launch next year. Unlike most other VR sets, it won't require a smartphone or an expensive PC to use.
While introducing the Go, Zuckerberg said it's a product meant to fill the gap between the affordable Gear VR and the Oculus Rift. It's the company's plan to attract a wider audience... probably because the general consumer isn't flocking to buy a gaming computer and a $400 headset.
 Permanent price drop
 Zuckerberg permanently dropped the price of the Oculus Rift to $399. It launched at $599.99, then fell to $499.99 before Facebook introduced a $399 summer sale that included a controller. A a price drop wouldn't be necessary if people were actually buying the Rift.
 Nobody wants to be social in VR
 Us regular Joes don't want to hang out in VR -- at least not yet -- but Facebook keeps jamming the idea down our throats. It introduced new avatars that can be customized and feature more lifelike facial expressions on Wednesday. But why?
Altspace VR, a firm that raised $10 million and once ran one of the more popular social VR experiences, originally shut down in August citing the ""general slowness of VR market growth."" It has since been acquired by Microsoft, which hopes to bring it back to life with its Mixed Reality headsets. This is probably the first time you're hearing of Altspace, and that's the problem.
 There's no must-have app
 There's no must-have app that's pulling people into the Rift or VR. Sure, it's fun to look at 360-degree photos or short video clips on the Gear VR with a Samsung phone, but there isn't a real compelling reason to plop down $400 plus the price of a gaming computer for VR. Facebook needs this, it's what helps sell gaming consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation. Most readers can probably name a game for one of those platforms, but can you name an app for the Rift?
 Still early days, but...
 It's still early for the VR industry and firms such as Sony have seen relative success. Canalys also estimates that there will be 20 million headsets in the market by 2020, which means there's still time for Facebook to turn this ship around and show the world why we really need to buy an Oculus.
On the other hand, Instagram exploded from 30 million users when Facebook bought it in 2012 to more than 800 million. WhatsApp had 450 million users when Facebook acquired it in 2014 and now has more than 1.3 billion users. The return on those buys in such a relatively short period of time certainly seems to have been greater than what Facebook has received from Oculus.
CNBC reached out to Facebook for comment but a spokesperson was not immediately available.

 The British government could ask internet giants like Facebook and Google to pay money towards measures to tackle cyber bullying and online abuse, proposals released Wednesday showed.
 The move is part of a broader package of measures proposed by the U.K. government in a green paper aimed at making the internet safer.
While the green paper acknowledges that social media companies are taking action to combat bad behavior online, Downing Street believes a levy could help the situation further.
 ""We believe that more needs to be done and that it is right that all companies should be involved and encouraged to play their part. This is the reason we will introduce a levy, to help us combat online harms,"" the paper said.
""As we develop plans for the levy's delivery, we will seek to ensure that it is proportionate and does not stifle growth or innovation, particularly for smaller companies and startups. And we will make sure it does not disincentivize tech companies investing in the U.K.""
The paper says that the levy will not be a tax on social media and will be voluntary. But it does not rule out underpinning the levy with legislation if needed.
Facebook did not comment directly on the levy proposal but said it is happy working with the U.K. government.
""Our priority is to make Facebook a safe place for people of all ages which is why we have spent a long time working with safety experts like the U.K. Safer Internet Centre, developing powerful tools to help people have a positive experience on Facebook. We welcome close collaboration between industry, experts and government to address this important issue,"" a spokesperson for the social network told CNBC by email Wednesday.
Twitter did not give a comment when contacted by CNBC but instead pointed to its current efforts to combat online abuse. The company is taking down 10 times more abusive accounts everyday compared with last year, for example.
Britain's government also proposed a new social media ""code of practice"" aimed at a joint approach to addressing bullying and humiliating online content. Alongside this, an annual report detailing the progress made could also be possible.
""Behavior that is unacceptable in real life is unacceptable on a computer screen. We need an approach to the internet that protects everyone without restricting growth and innovation in the digital economy,"" Karen Bradley, the U.K.'s digital, culture, and media minister, said in a press release.

 Credit Suisse raises Alphabet and Facebook price forecasts   
 4:11  PM ET Wed, 11 Oct 2017 |  00:33 
 Investors should continue to own mega-cap internet stocks even after their big runs this year, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Credit Suisse reaffirmed its outperform ratings and raised its price targets for both Alphabet and Facebook to the highest on Wall Street, citing increasing ad spending for the internet giants.
""Our conversations with advertisers suggest minimal search budget growth deceleration coupled with potentially accelerating spend on YouTube,"" analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ""We continue to believe that the opportunity for YouTube to become a significantly larger revenue contributor is still largely ahead of us.""
 Ju raised his price target for Alphabet shares to $1,350 from $1,100, representing 37 percent upside from Tuesday's close. He now has the highest price target on the stock out of 39 analysts, according to FactSet.
In similar fashion, the analyst is very optimistic on Facebook's fundamentals.
Our conversations with advertisers ""suggest ongoing CPM [cost per 1,000 ad impressions] acceleration, as strong enough indicators that there is likely upward bias to estimates for 2H17 and hence [we] raised our mobile [Facebook] Newsfeed estimates,"" he wrote. ""Our channel checks continue to suggest ongoing budget allocation to Instagram.""
The analyst raised his forecast for Facebook stock to $235 from $190, representing 37 percent upside from Tuesday's close. It is also now the most bullish forecast for the company out of 40 analysts, according to FactSet.
Alphabet shares have rallied 25 percent this year through Tuesday, compared with the market's 14 percent gain. Facebook shares are up 49 percent in the same time period.
Both internet companies' shares are up slightly Wednesday morning.

Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Wednesday the Oculus Go, a standalone VR headset that will cost $199 and launches early next year.
Zuckerberg didn't talk much about the product but noted that it will fill an important void between mobile VR headsets — which don't offer advanced features but are affordable — and more sophisticated products such as the Oculus Rift, which require expensive computers. He revealed the headset during the Oculus Connect 4 developer conference on Wednesday,
 Facebook's head of VR, Hugo Barra, said the headset features the next generation of lenses from the ones in the Oculus Rift. It has a special built-in display with wide viewing angles and sharp images to avoid the ""screen door"" effect that viewers sometimes experience if they see pixels. It will ship with speakers — which means you don't need headphones if you don't want them — and has support for the Gear VR library of apps, and a standalone controller.
""[It's] hands down the easiest way for people to get into VR,"" Barra said. ""We think people are going to spend a lot more time in VR when they get a standalone device.""
 Oculus for Business
 Barra also announced a new Oculus for Business initiative in which it will allow companies to place bulk orders for Oculus Rift headsets. ""Oculus for Business is for companies who want to explore VR to create new workflows,"" Barra explained, noting that Audi is using Rift products in dealerships to cater to customers. Oculus will also sell bundles to businesses that include Rift, controllers and an extra sensor for room-scale VR. Businesses will also get a full VR commercial license, a warranty and dedicated customer support.
 Santa Cruz
 Zuckerberg and Barra also briefly talked about the Oculus Santa Cruz, which until now has only been known as a prototype the company was working on.
Santa Cruz headsets, which are also standalone and aren't wired to a PC, will launch next year. These headsets support Oculus' ""inside out tracking"" capabilities. That means the headset doesn't require special sensors inside a room but rather can determine a user's location as one walks around a space, such as a room in the real world, using sensors built on the headset.

 House Intelligence Committee to release Russian ads   
 3:00  PM ET Wed, 11 Oct 2017 |  00:43 
 The House Intelligence Committee plans to release Russia-linked ads that ran on Facebook during the 2016 election, the panel's leaders said Wednesday, according to NBC News. 
 They likely will not make the ads public before a Nov. 1 hearing featuring officials from Facebook, Twitter and Google.
The House committee is investigating Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and possible collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign. Reps. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, and Adam Schiff, D-Calif., are leading the probe. 
 The announcement came following the lawmakers' meeting with Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. The social media executive also met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. 
Facebook has already shared about 3,000 ads bought by Russia-linked groups with the congressional committees investigating the Russian influence campaign. 
Google also has discovered that Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its platforms, according to reports.

Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg
 Former Microsoft exec Steven Sinofsky knows what Facebook is going through.
 He was at the giant when it was the undisputed leader of the tech industry, and when sentiment turned against the company and everybody — from federal regulators to competitors to the press — was attacking it.
Now Facebook is going through a similar phase. A couple years ago, Mark Zuckerberg was viewed as a wonder-kid genius who had built a tech company worth hundreds of billions in less than a decade, and was making a well-studied turn into philanthropy.
 Then came the 2016 presidential election. Facebook users watched as their feeds were filled with polarizing political posts, including fake news and ads, including some that the company later admitted were bought by Russians in an attempt to influence the election.
Now, the company is being forced to testify before various committees on Capitol Hill about the Russian ads, and Zuckerberg is getting raked over the coals for tone-deaf moves like showing flood-stricken Puerto Rico to demonstrate its virtual reality platform. All the while, commentators slam it for being too powerful and insufficiently apologetic, calling it one of the ""Four Horsemen"" or ""Frightful Five.""

Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg
 Sinofsky captures the disorienting feeling Facebook employees probably have right now, where they thought they were on top of the world and can't quite figure out why everybody suddenly seems to hate them.
As he put it, ""We were just trying to make software. The more ppl said we were trying to be bad and do harm the wider the gap became. Surreal to us."" 
But he says this is a normal part of the growing-up process for companies, and he offered some recommendations on how Facebook could handle it using a framework called Tuckman's stages of group development.
In the end, he's confident Facebook and other social networks will make it through the other side.

Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook
 For months, Facebook has been trying to counter criticism about its influence on the 2016 presidential election. The company has hired three crisis communications firms and has bought digital and newspaper ads. Mark Zuckerberg, its chief executive, has posted live video to the social network to explain how much he cared about election integrity.
This week, it sent Sheryl Sandberg to Washington to charm Congress and the public.
Ms. Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, acted as the giant tech company’s chief ambassador in the capital on Wednesday and Thursday — shuttling around to talk with dozens of lawmakers, and making numerous promises about how the company would change.
 In a public appearance hosted by Axios, the news start-up, she admitted that Facebook had made mistakes during the presidential campaign. She offered lawmakers who are investigating Russia’s meddling in the election more data from the company. And she promised the Congressional Black Caucus that she would help appoint an African-American to the Facebook board.
“She said 10 to 15 times, ‘We’ve got to do better,’” Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, a Democrat from Missouri, said after Ms. Sandberg met with the Congressional Black Caucus, which has complained about the level of diversity at the company.
Facebook faces a variety of concerns about fake news and its broader role in the presidential campaign. But the criticism has become far more intense in the last few months, after the company revealed that Russian-linked groups bought more than $100,000 in ads on Facebook to influence the election.
The complaints about Facebook have also helped propel debate about the technology industry more widely, and whether the biggest technology companies — like Facebook, Google and Amazon — have grown too large and powerful. Some lawmakers are now talking about potential ways to regulate the businesses.
In addition to the new crisis communications firms, the company has placed ads in places like The New York Times and The Washington Post. But it has been difficult to quell the concerns of lawmakers, and Ms. Sandberg’s meetings this week were focused on fixing various problems facing the company.
Ms. Sandberg, 48, knows her way in Washington, having worked here for years as a top aide in the Treasury Department. She is now regularly mentioned as a potential political candidate. That speculation increased in 2013 after the release of her first book, “Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead.” She was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and is a top Democratic donor.
She has tried to deflect rumors about running for office, but they persist, and her appearance in Washington this week is unlikely to quell them. At her only public event in Washington, she gave smooth and measured answers to questions from Mike Allen, a co-founder of Axios, the online news start-up that hosted the event. The performance stood in stark contrast to efforts from Mr. Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and chief executive, who usually appears far less comfortable in such situations — and who has also been mentioned as a potential political candidate.

With House Intelligence Committee leaders who are investigating the company’s role in foreign meddling in the election, Ms. Sandberg agreed to hand over a broader set of data linked to fake Russian accounts and to give more information about how that data was targeted to users. With top Republican and Democratic leaders of the House, she emphasized the company’s desire to help with the investigation and promoted its plan to hire thousands of people to review ad purchases so the mistakes of the 2016 election are prevented from happening again.
“They are leaning in on this issue,” said Representative K. Michael Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the Intelligence Committee’s investigation, alluding to Ms. Sandberg’s book.
“They have launched a platform that communicates around the world,” Mr. Conaway said, “and it’s important for us to understand their perspective.”
In a one-hour meeting Thursday with at least 17 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Ms. Sandberg delivered the same message and a peace offering.
The members have been critical of Facebook’s lack of diversity on its board of directors, and lawmakers have criticized the company for allowing racially charged ads on its site during the election that were placed by the Russian accounts under review in the federal investigation. Sitting at a large wood conference table with the House members of the caucus, she listened to complaints and questions while taking notes.
Ms. Sandberg responded with personal reflections. She said she was disappointed that Facebook ads had been used to sow racial division during the election, according to the caucus chairman, Representative Cedric L. Richmond, a Democrat from Louisiana. She told the caucus that she prayed daily that Facebook hadn’t contributed to the outcome of the election, according to Representative G. K. Butterfield, a Democrat from North Carolina. And she promised that Facebook would appoint an African-American member to its board in the near future.
“I remain cautiously optimistic,” Mr. Butterfield said after the meeting.
A group of Facebook executives, including Elliot Schrage and Anne Kornblut, traveled with her from the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. The Axios event was filled with Facebook lobbyists including Joel Kaplan, who had been running damage control with Republicans in government, and Erin Egan, a top policy executive.
After the meeting with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, one of her last events of the tour, Ms. Sandberg walked past dozens of reporters with smartphones pointed at her and asking questions. Accompanied by Ms. Egan and the company’s chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams, she walked up the marble steps of the Capitol to the white-carpet offices of the House minority leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, where she put her big, black satchel in an empty conference room as she typed into her smartphone.
When asked to comment on her day, Ms. Sandberg waved her hands and said: “Sorry, we’re not talking. I need time for myself.”

 Cramer: Facebook should hire people, not rely on machines to police network   
 11:13  AM ET Thu, 12 Oct 2017 |  03:08 
 Facebook should hire more people instead of relying on machines to detect the presence of fake accounts and bullying on its social network, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.
 In an interview Thursday with Axios, Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said the social media giant has invested heavily in machine learning to find ""bad actors"" on its platform. 
The company, which has more than 2 billion active users, is also hiring 4,000 more people to increase oversight of ads and content, Sandberg said.
 ""I do not trust the machines to do what people can do at this stage of the game,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street.""
""But it would cost them money to have humans to review and spot check, and yet humans are the only ones right now who can detect this,"" the host of CNBC's ""Mad Money"" added. ""When it comes to fake news and lies, you actually need a human component.""
Congress is currently investigating the role of Russian actors in the 2016 U.S. election, including thousands of advertisements that ran on Facebook. The company is working with Congress to provide information.
Cramer asked whether it would actually significantly hurt Facebook's gross margins to hire more human oversight. 
He urged Congress to ask social media companies to put ""some humans in charge of the machines.""
""This is about the gross margins of these companies,"" Cramer said. ""If they have to start hiring people who are English lit. majors rather than those computer scientists out of Stanford, you would see their gross margins go down.""
Cramer added that he has"" tremendous respect for machines and machine learning for what's been done algorithmically.""
""I think they are fantastic at looking at what I regard as keywords,"" he said.
CNBC has reached out to Facebook for comment.

 Axios' Allen on FB fake accounts: Could be hottest issue of 2018   
 4:01  PM ET Thu, 12 Oct 2017 |  03:12 
 Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said Thursday she supports the public release of Russian-linked political ads that ran on Facebook and have been shared with Congress.
 ""Things happened on our platform in this election that shouldn't have happened, especially — and very troubling — foreign interference in a democratic election,"" Sandberg told Axios. ""And we know that we have a responsibility to do everything we can to prevent this kind of abuse on our platform."" 
Sandberg, who supported Hillary Clinton in the election and is a former Treasury Department staffer, is expected to meet with members of Congress on Thursday, according to Recode. She has already met with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, according to previous reports.

 The meetings come as Congress is investigating the role of Russian actors in the 2016 U.S. election, including thousands of advertisements that ran on Facebook. Sandberg said she supports publicly releasing the advertisements, as well as the pages they were linked to.
Leaders of a House Intelligence Committee panel said they plan to release the ads, likely after a Nov. 1 hearing, according to NBC News.
Sandberg said the targeting of those ads will also be released.
""We don't want this kind of foreign interference,"" Sandberg said. ""These ads are divisive, and they are down, and the pages are down, because they are from fake accounts ... a lot of them, if they were run by legitimate people, we would let them run."" 
But Sandberg also called for other platforms, as well as the government, to rise to a similar standard of transparency. She noted that ads that promote violence and hate were part of the problem that Facebook had already been working to address.
Sandberg said that in the early days of monitoring on Facebook, preventing the hacking of private accounts was a primary goal.
""And then we started to hear the rumors — and this was around the election itself — of a different kind of attack,"" Sandberg said. ""It was a more subtle [attack], even though just as important, which is posting in an inauthentic way to try to be deceptive and divisive.""
She said that at this point, Facebook believes it has done a ""thorough"" job of identifying the Russian actor in question, thanks in part to the use of rubles to purchase the ads and the presence of fake accounts.
""We are following up aggressively on every lead we have,"" Sandberg said. ""What we really owe the American people is determination. We are determined."" 
 'We are very different than a media company'
 Facebook has been criticized for the promotion of fake news by creating ""echo chambers,"" and for allowing malicious targeting of specific groups. Sandberg said that users who get news on Facebook typically see a broader set of sources than through traditional media.
""We are very different than a media company. We are a technology company at our heart. We hire engineers ... but that doesn't mean we don't have responsibility,"" she said. 
(Facebook did hire prominent journalists, including Campbell Brown, and hosts videos shows).
Facebook has found marking ""fake news"" as hoaxes through a third party decreases the number of times a story is shared, Sandberg said. She also noted that Facebook is cracking down on the monetization of false reports, which she said is often as much of a driver of ""fake news"" as politics.
""We don't check the information people put on Facebook before they run it, and I don't think anyone should want us to do that,"" Sandberg said.

 });Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg denounced sexual harassment at the third annual Wall Street Journal Women in the Workplace dinner on Monday evening.
 ""We can't tolerate Harvey Weinstein-like behavior,"" she told the crowd, alluding to recent allegations of sexual misconduct by former employees against the film studio exec.
Last week, a  New York Times investigation chronicled over two decades of sexual harassment claims against the producer along with his many settlements.
 Days later, The New Yorker released a harrowing expose in which three of Weinstein's accusers shared personal accounts of sexual assault and harassment.

 Italian actress-director Asia Argento is one of the three women who alleges that she was raped by the producer, saying he forcibly performed oral sex on her.

 });
 Since the report was published, other high-profile women, like Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, have said that they were also harassed by Weinstein.
The Weinstein Company, which the Hollywood executive co-founded, fired him shortly after the allegations were publicized.
""It's not just about him. It's not just about the other men that do it,"" said Sandberg. ""It's about all the people around them that know and don't do anything.""
The Facebook COO called on colleagues to speak up when they witness or hear about sexual harassment and said that there need to be major ramifications for these types of misdeeds.
 Sandberg has long been a champion for equal rights for women. The Facebook exec has frequently spoken out about the lack of progress for women in top roles.
In 2013, she published the book ""Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead"" and founded an organization by the same name in order to ""shine a light on gender differences"" and give advice to women looking to reach their goals.
Sandberg explained that situations like Weinstein's should never occur. ""When it does happen and someone loses their job and is publicly embarrassed, I think that's great,"" she said. ""Not because I want that to happen but because I think the only deterrent for other people is to see that there are disastrous consequences.""
""There need to be those same consequences for the people that tolerate it around those people,"" she added. ""And I think we are going to get there.""

Order food right from Facebook
 Users can now order food for delivery without ever leaving Facebook.
The company announced Friday that it has partnered with Delivery.com, DoorDash, ChowNow, Zuppler, EatStreet, Slice and Olo to offer users the ability to order meals without having to open each of those individual applications.
 Facebook also teamed up with restaurant chains like Papa John's, Five Guys and Panera, the company said.
To order food, a user simply needs to tap the menu button on the bottom right of the new Facebook app and then select ""Order Food."" Restaurants will be listed, as is the option to begin an order for pickup or delivery.
Facebook began testing the service several months ago and has already offered similar functionality inside Facebook Messenger, its chat client.
Users should find the new delivery option in the latest Facebook app as it rolls out to desktop, Android and iOS devices in the U.S. now.

Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chief executive officer of Twitter Inc.
 A pair of powerful black lawmakers in the U.S. Congress will visit Silicon Valley next week to push companies like Airbnb, Facebook, Twitter, Lyft and Uber to improve diversity.
Beginning Monday, the two Democratic pols — Reps. Barbara Lee and G.K. Butterfield — plan to stress in meetings with those five tech giants and others that their efforts to hire and retain more black engineers and executives just haven't progressed swiftly enough.
In an interview with Recode, Lee said she would also prod Facebook and Twitter to address racist content that has been spread on their platforms, particularly in light of reports that Russian agents — in a bid to stir political unrest in the United States — shared such messages on social media during the 2016 presidential election.
 ""They have got to understand, they've got to move quicker,"" Lee said of the tech industry as a whole.
Then, turning to Facebook and Twitter, she continued: ""And they've got to figure out a way to stop allowing these ads that really undermine our elections and create havoc, really, in communities by trying to create division and hostility and hatred.""
The house call by the Congressional Black Caucus is part of its campaign called Tech2020, which aims to increase the representation of African-American workers at all levels of the tech industry — engineers at startups, the investors who fund them, and the executives that run companies or serve on their corporate boards.
CBC lawmakers launched their initiative in 2015, when Democrats had more power in the nation's capital — and at the time, they even threatened to regulate the tech industry if it failed to improve its hiring practices. In the age of President Donald Trump, however, Lee conceded that it had become more difficult.
""I don't think they have a real commitment,"" she said of Republicans on issues related to diversity.
Some of the CBC's biggest victories, however, have come as a result of lawmakers tapping the power of their bully pulpit. Last year, for example, CBC members  slammed Airbnb over reports that its home-sharing hosts had discriminated against black renters, contributing to the tech giant's subsequent internal investigation, along with a series of reforms. More recently, CBC members urged Uber this summer to hire more people of color, as the ride-hailing company  seeks to fill a long list of leadership vacancies. Lee said in an interview that the CBC would revive that call during its meeting with Uber this week.
Amid the sustained pressure from the CBC and other critics, some in Silicon Valley have committed to changing the way they recruit and retain workers, with an eye on finding and training more employees from underrepresented groups. But their own diversity data show progress has come slowly.
At  Facebook, for example, it's still the case that roughly half of its team in the U.S. is white, according to a report released in August. Black engineers only account for 3 percent of the social giant's U.S. payroll. Facebook recently has said it is making strides in addressing other diversity issues,  including hiring more women.
At Twitter, meanwhile, roughly 57 percent of its U.S. workforce is white, and about 3 percent is black, according to its 2016 data. For many tech giants, though, the problem spans well beyond their rank-and-file employees: Lyft and Uber, to name two, count no black workers in tech leadership roles, the two companies have reported recently.
To that end, Butterfield and Lee plan to press those companies — and others like Intel, Salesforce and TaskRabbit -- to redouble their efforts. ""I have many qualified constituents who would like to work in the tech sector,"" Lee said, ""and systematically they are just denied these opportunities over and over again.""
They also intend to urge companies to appoint more black executives and board members. And for those tech firms that still do not share data about their workers, the Democratic lawmakers are asking them to start publishing annual reports.
But their visit takes on added significance amid reports about Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential election. In a bid to sow social and political unrest, Kremlin-backed trolls turned to social media, sharing posts and purchasing ads that specifically inflamed racial tensions — particularly around groups like Black Lives Matter.
Some CBC members quickly criticized Facebook and Twitter for  allowing racist messaging to spread at all on their platforms. And the entire caucus pressed Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, about the issue during a private meeting Thursday on Capitol Hill.
""It was very disturbing, some of what has taken place, and we let het know that very clearly,"" Lee said of the meeting. She called on Facebook to release all 3,000 Russia-backed ads, which the company previously said it would work with lawmakers to do.
Facebook also has pledged to hire 1,000 new workers to review future ads. And there, too, Lee said it was important for the social giant to employ more ""African-Americans and people of color analyzing these ads"" and their effects.
At the moment, though, ""when you look at their numbers they just don't have that,"" the congresswoman said.
For his part, Butterfield said at a press conference Thursday that Facebook had committed to appointing a new black board member. Hours later, the CBC acknowledged in a press release that board diversity was ""something that Facebook committed to changing"" during meetings with black lawmakers ""two years ago"" — and still had not yet done.
A spokesman for Facebook declined to comment on the meeting.

 Facebook is under fire from advertisers   
 3:03  PM ET Fri, 13 Oct 2017 |  00:52 
 Advertising companies are increasingly talking about discrepancies between Facebook's measurements and outside information, highlighting a digital industrywide problem over advertising standards. 
 ""We get concerned with how much money we placed there and how effective our marketing dollars are,"" said CEO Bill Abbott of Crown Media Family Networks, which runs the Hallmark Channel. 
""It's a big dilemma for the advertising business — not only for television, not only for video, not only for us at Hallmark.""
 The Video Advertising Bureau, where Abbott sits on the board of directors, released a report earlier this month bringing up multiple issues with Facebook's ad measurement techniques. Other board members include executives from NBCUniversal, A+E Networks, Scripps Networks, ESPN, Discovery and Turner, among others.
The report's findings include:
 Facebook's platform ""reached"" more people in every state than the 2016 population of those states according to the U.S. census. In the case of New York, Facebook reported the potential reach was 42 percent higher. The differences were more pronounced in the top 10 major cities. For example, Facebook's potential reach for people between 18 to 34 in Chicago was 1.9 million people, while the census reported only 808,785 in the category, a difference of 135 percent. Dallas' potential Facebook reach was 1.2 million, but the census only recorded 379,567 people in the age group (216 percent more). Facebook's reported estimated daily reach posted on its advertiser dashboard was up to 12 times higher than if customers manually calculated the reach using its own data. 
VAB's study follows other instances of questionable metrics. 
In September, Pivotal Research Group senior analyst found Facebook's advertising management system said it could reach 41 million 18- to 24-year-olds in the U.S. while census data showed there were only 31 million people in the group living in the U.S. — a discrepancy that Facebook explained by saying that the reach numbers included visitors. 
But that explanation doesn't make sense for the more localized examples in the VAB study, because the numbers Facebook reports for its potential reach for ""everyone in this location"" and ""people who live in this location"" are identical.
A Facebook spokesperson explained: ""Reach estimations are based on a number of factors, including Facebook user behaviors, user demographics, location data from devices, and other factors. They are designed to estimate how many people in a given area are eligible to see an ad a business might run. They are not designed to match population or census estimates. We are always working to improve our estimates.""
Advertisers have also grown more skeptical after Facebook itself reported several measurement issues this year, including overestimating the average viewing time on video ads and differences on ad performance metrics on its mobile app and internal dashboard.
To be sure, there could be multiple motives behind the report. The companies on the VAB board are mostly TV networks, and are competing against Facebook for advertising money.
At the same time, these companies are heavily involved in advertising on Facebook — both because they put their own video content on Facebook and sell ads against it, and because they buy ads on Facebook to promote their offerings. So their criticism comes at least partly from experience.
Meanwhile, nonmedia brands have also criticized Facebook's targeted advertising metrics, with Procter & Gamble notably telling the Wall Street Journal last year that it was scaling back on these specific ads because they were not that effective.
 Why Facebook is in the crosshairs
 Abbot is quick to point out that while the report picks apart Facebook's flaws, there's an issue with how every digital company measures advertising success on its platform, including online advertising market leader Google.
The root stems from the fact that digital companies self-report their data for the most part, and there are no universal digital ad measurements. And by showing audience numbers to be wildly different than the census, it throws into question what other metrics may be off.
""They're probably the easy target because they are so big, and everybody utilizes them,"" said Abbott. 
While companies have bought ads on Facebook and Google for years, the two giants have been taking more of the pie, with eMarketer estimating they'll take in more than 60 percent of U.S. digital ad revenue this year.
Last year was also the first time digital ad spending surpassed TV. According to an Interactive Advertising Bureau report by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, U.S. digital advertising revenue reached $72.5 billion, while media agency Magna estimated TV ad spending hit $67 billion. 
""The concentration of (ad buying) activity wasn't quite as obvious years ago,"" said David Cohen, president of Magna in North America which manages $37 billion worth of global marketing budgets on behalf of brands. ""Years ago, there was much more of a healthy ecosystem outside of Google and Facebook in regards to concentration of dollars.""
Matt Pharr, chief analytics officer at digital advertising agency MXM which works with companies including Benjamin Moore, Allergan and Sun-Maid, says that as advertisers spend more money on Facebook, they're under pressure to explain exactly how effective those ads are.
""People start asking these kinds of questions,"" Pharr said. ""They want to be highly confident in the decision they are making on the dollars they are spending on these platforms.""
 Calls for a universal standard
 One reason why advertisers are suspicious of digital measurement is because it's hard to reliably track individuals online. For example, people may have multiple accounts or log in from different devices, or multiple people may share the same account.
""They have a hard time understanding how many times they are hitting a unique individual,"" explained Pharr. ""It's not unique to Facebook. It's across all of digital media.""
Many advertisers and media companies believe the solutions are to have a third-party company create universal standards for measuring digital advertising reach, and for Facebook and other digital companies to release their data to advertisers so they can analyze it themselves. 
In TV, most people hold third-party Nielsen ratings to be paramount despite its faults and flaws. Newspapers and magazines had circulation numbers and sales. But no such universal measurement standards exist in digital. Each company uses its own metrics.
""The linear TV business has been built on standards and norms to ensure numbers are represented to clients accurately,"" said Ben Price, Discovery Communications president of U.S. ad sales and a VAB board member. ""As consumers are viewing content on new and different platforms at any given time, it's important for all stakeholders involved that those standards are extended and all numbers are accurately represented.""
Magna's Cohen said, ""Google and Facebook have lots of different products and great measurement solutions, but it's all in their environments.""
Brands do rely on third-party companies to audit and measure ad campaigns against the standards advertising organisation Media Rating Council (MRC) sets, Cohen explained. Companies also use measurement firms like comScore, Datalogix and Moat. But while Facebook is willing to give third parties some of the information, it isn't willing to give advertisers the data directly. A Facebook spokesperson cited privacy-related concerns as the reason.
""Slowly, but surely we're chipping away at that as an industry, but historically Google and Facebook have been hesitant to do it,"" Cohen said.
The MRC — which is in the process of auditing Facebook and Google — is working on creating digital media audience measurement standards, with the first phase focused on video specifically. Ideally the standards will align measurement across television, over-the-top content and digital video. But measuring across platforms is difficult and will take time, and in the meantime advertisers are frustrated. 
""Everyone has to be on a level playing field because Facebook and others in the digital space self-report, and they don't have that oversight,"" said Crown's Abbott. ""I think that they're able to make some claims, and quite frankly put their advertisers in a position where (Facebook) might not be delivering what their objectives are.""

 A top Facebook executive admitted Wednesday that Russian agents had used the social network's popular Messenger platform to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
Facebook Messenger boss David Marcus disclosed that a ""very small"" number of the 470 accounts active in the Russian interference campaign were using Messenger to communicate with their users.
 Marcus cautioned that the company was still determining, alongside federal investigators, how Russia-linked accounts may have tried to influence the U.S. political discourse last year. But he said inquiries ""at this stage"" showed that these accounts were not prolifically using his product.

""My understanding is that it's a very small number,"" Marcus said at The Wall Street Journal's D.Live conference in Laguna Beach, Calif. ""The way that the platform was used is still being investigated right now on the Messenger side of things, but traditionally if you're a page, for instance, you cannot message people. So people have to message you.""
Messenger was  reportedly used by some pages with ties to Russian operatives. Marcus, like other Facebook executives, argued that the work done by Facebook around the world was being wrongly ""overshadowed"" by the Russia ""narrative.""
""Clearly, when you design a platform that reaches 2 billion people every month, sometimes bad things happen and we shouldn't tolerate those things,"" Marcus said.

 Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos says in a leaked audio recording that the company's cyber defense operations are run ""like a college campus, almost"" to satisfy the company's internal culture of freedom to experiment, even though Facebook faces the same kinds of highly sophisticated attacks as a defense contractor.
 ""The threats that we are facing have increased significantly and the quality of the adversaries that we are facing…Both technically and from a cultural perspective I don't feel like we have caught up with our responsibility,"" Stamos says in the recording, which was made in July and obtained by the tech news site ZDNet.
""We have the threat profile of a…defense contractor, but we run our corporate networks…like a college campus, almost,"" he says.
 Stamos, formerly the chief security officer of Yahoo, then went on Twitter to explain his coments.
""The college campus wording is just a figure of speech to make a point,"" Stamos posted.
The Facebook executive then went on:
""Tech companies are famous for providing freedom for engineers to customize their environments & experiment with new tools…allowing for this freedom helps creativity and productivity.
""We have to weigh that against the fact that we have become a potential target of advanced threat actors.
""As a result, we can't architect our security the same way a defense contractor can, with limited computing options and no freedom.
""Keeping the company secure while allowing the culture to blossom is a challenge, but a motivating one,"" Stamos wrote.

Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr (R), R-N.C.; and Senate Intelligence Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., hold a news conference on the status of the committee's inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, October 4, 2017.
 The lawmaker overseeing the probe into how Russian agents used Facebook to sway last year's U.S. election was hoping to hear from one of the company's technical experts.
 Instead, Facebook will send its top lawyer and a former Washington insider to testify on Nov. 1.
Facebook said Thursday it will send Colin Stretch, its vice president and general counsel for more than four years, to testify before House and Senate panels.
 Neither CEO Mark Zuckerberg nor COO Sheryl Sandberg, who met privately with lawmakers last week, will appear at the public hearings, as previously reported by CNBC.
The Republican chairman of the Senate committee investigating the matter, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, has previously said he hoped the company would send someone with a technology background.
""I think it's more important that we get the person who's most capable of talking about the technical aspects of what they need to do to identify foreign money that may come in and what procedures, if any, need to be put in law that make sure elections are not intruded upon by foreign entities,"" Burr said last month.
Stretch's background, however, is rooted firmly in the legal profession.
Prior to joining Facebook in 2010, he was with the high-powered Washington law firm Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick for most of a decade.
Prior to that, Stretch, a graduate of Harvard Law School, was a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.
His knowledge of the Washington landscape helped him negotiate a 2011 settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which had charged Facebook with deceiving consumers about whether it would keep their data private.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., left, and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., speak about online political ads and preventing foreign interference in U.S. elections, during a news conference, Thursday, Oct. 19, 2017, on Capitol Hill in Washington.
 Three senators began a bipartisan push Thursday to rein in social media political ads amid fears about Russian meddling in American elections.
 Should the bill gain more bipartisan traction, it would mark one of the strongest efforts yet to check companies like Facebook and Google.
Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Mark Warner, D-Va., crafted the bill, called the ""Honest Ads Act."" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., signed on as a co-sponsor.
 The senators hope the bill will curb the reach of foreign-bought political ads during American elections. The U.S. intelligence community has concluded Russia launched a campaign to influence the 2016 election and will try to do so again during next year's midterm elections. 
It is not clear how many more of the majority Republicans in Congress will get behind the bill. It will need broader GOP support to pass. Klobuchar and Warner expressed optimism that more Republicans would support the plan. 
Here's what the legislation would do, according to the senators' offices: 
 Expand federal rules to require a disclaimer and disclosure to the Federal Election Commission for paid online political ads. Ads advocating for or against a specific candidate online would also need a disclaimer. Disclaimers say whether a campaign paid for or supported the message.  Digital platforms with 50 million or more unique monthly visitors would have to keep a public database of political ads. They would have to maintain records for entities that bought more than $500 in political ads in the preceding 12 months. The database would have to include a copy of the ad, the rate charged and a summary of its target audience, among other pieces of information.  It would also require the platforms to make a ""reasonable"" effort to stop foreign nationals from using ads to influence elections.  
The Russian effort ""exposes a national security vulnerability when it comes to online political advertisements,"" Klobuchar said. American laws ""have failed to keep up"" with the technology foreign entities can use, she added. 
Tech titans Facebook and Google parent Alphabet have said they found Russia-linked ads on their platforms during the election.
Klobuchar described new regulation as necessary because of both companies' vast reach. She noted that Facebook and Google accounted for nearly all digital ad revenue growth last year and now serve as a news source to millions of voters. 
It remains to be seen what measures the social media platforms will support. Major technology companies have opposed similar rules in the past. 
Warner on Thursday described the measures as ""common sense, light touch regulations."" 
In a statement Thursday, Facebook said it will work with lawmakers to increase transparency in political ads. 
""We have already announced the steps Facebook will take on our own and we look forward to continuing the conversation with lawmakers as we work toward a legislative solution,"" the company said. 
A Google spokesperson said the company supports ""efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse."" 
""We're evaluating steps we can take on our own platforms and will work closely with lawmakers, the FEC, and the industry to explore the best solutions,"" the spokesperson said. 
Twitter has also found fake accounts and bots linked to Russia. The company has said it is taking steps to stop malicious bots and misinformation on the platform.
In a statement to CNBC on Wednesday, Twitter said it looks forward to ""engaging"" with Congress and the Federal Election Commission on ad transparency. 
Representatives from all three of those companies will attend a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Nov. 1. 
Klobuchar serves as the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, which has a role in elections. Warner is the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels investigating Russian meddling and possible collusion with the Donald Trump campaign.

 Facebook is one of the best-performing large cap technology stocks so far this year. But even after the big run, one Wall Street analyst recommends the social media giant's shares into its third-quarter earnings report.
 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey on Thursday reiterated its buy rating for Facebook, predicting solid results due to its new video ad offerings.
""We expect FB to post strong 3Q results … driven by improvement in monetization and user growth across both Facebook and Instagram,"" analyst Youssef Squali wrote in a note to clients entitled ""Reiterating Buy Ahead of 3Q Results.""

Senators Amy Klobuchar, D-MN and John McCain, R-AZ.
 Legislation to be unveiled Thursday would for the first time impose some regulation on internet advertising giants like Facebook and Google. 
 The Honest Ads Act would require digital platforms to archive in a publicly available file advertisements purchased around election content, according to Axios, who got a preview of the proposed bill. 
""The file would contain a digital copy of the advertisement, a description of the audience the advertisement targets, the number of views generated, the dates and times of publication, the rates charged, and the contract information of the purchaser,"" the bill reportedly reads. 
 The bill would also amend the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act to expand the definition of ""electioneering communication"" to include digital platforms and paid online advertisements —  currently only broadcast television, radio, cable and satellite communications are included.
Speculation of greater internet regulation has loomed for weeks following disclosures by Facebook, Twitter and Google that Russian entities purchased politically motivated ads on the sites during the 2016 presidential election.
All three companies have been asked to testify before congressional intelligence committees in a broad review of foreign election interference. 
The new bill is the first indication that regulation could actually come to fruition. It was introduced by Senators Mark Warner and Amy Klobuchar and co-sponsored by Senator John McCain.

 });A LinkedIn photo of Facebook exec Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth.
 Mark Zuckerberg has once again turned to a key troubleshooter, Andrew Bosworth, to help Facebook out of a jam.
 With Regina Dugan saying she will leave her role as head of Facebook's research lab, Bosworth is now clearly in charge of all consumer hardware products — from Oculus VR headsets to whatever secret devices Dugan's Building 8 had been developing.
The move underscores how far Facebook has to go to catch Google and other tech giants in building the next big computing platform.
 Google's hardware product line, for example, now includes smartphones, laptops, VR gear, a home assistant and even wireless headsets that can translate 40 languages.
All of these products are powered increasingly by artificial intelligence, with many of them featuring the Google Assistant.
Facebook, meanwhile, has flirted with building a smartphone and is reported to be building a video chat device, yet the only hardware it has for now is a line of VR headsets.
 Bosworth revamped Facebook's ad strategy for mobile
 Zuckerberg's appointment of Bosworth points to the confidence he has in his former Harvard teaching assistant, who helped guide the company through a previous strategic challenge.
Five years ago, when Zuckerberg needed someone to manage Facebook's transition from selling desktop advertising to mobile ads, he tapped Bosworth, who is known for his enthusiasm and has admitted to once punching a co-worker at an event.
Soon after, Facebook began putting what it called ""sponsored posts"" in the news feeds of its users.
While some complained about the ads, which previously had been placed on the right side of Facebook (desktop) pages, they were a hit with advertisers and investors alike.
Since the summer of 2012, when Bosworth began overseeing its mobile ad product, the company's sales have exploded nearly eightfold and are seen hitting $39 billion this year.
Facebook shares, meanwhile, are trading at record highs.
But Facebook is looking ahead to a time when consumers use something other than a smartphone to run their favorite applications at work and home.
The company sees how Google has now produced not one but two generations of its own smartphone, the Pixel, and has begun to market its assistant, called Google Home.
Amazon, meanwhile, makes an even more-popular AI-powered assistant.
The departure of Dugan, who promoted experimental systems like mind-reading software, and elevation of Bosworth suggest Facebook has decided to accelerate its efforts to get more hardware into consumers' hands.
 'Behavioral economics'
 One possible signal to the company's plans is a comment Bosworth made on Twitter earlier this month, after Richard Thaler was awarded a Nobel Prize in economics. Thaler is an economist who was once belittled by his peers for his view that raw human emotions, rather than rational thinking, drives economic activity.
""Behavioral economics has driven a lot of my thinking about products at Facebook, organic and otherwise,"" Bosworth tweeted, in a reference to Thaler's award.
One way of reading the comment is that Bosworth favors products that people actually use, driven by their human needs, rather than those that engineers merely think are cool.
Several days later, during Facebook's annual VR conference, Bosworth sent out more than a dozen tweets promoting the company's Oculus line — the only Facebook hardware products that consumers are using today. Among those tweets, Bosworth, a frequent Twitter user, pointed to a blog post from Michael Abrash, Facebook's chief scientist.
In the post, Abrash argued that virtual reality and augmented reality will ""converge"" over the next decade, creating experiences that will let users ""mix the real and virtual worlds freely.""
""Long but valuable read from our chief scientist on the future we are building,"" Bosworth wrote.
The reference to VR echoed some of what Bosworth wrote in a Facebook post on Aug. 24, the day he was named to his new role, when he said he was ""shifting gears to work on virtual reality, augmented reality and consumer hardware.""
In that post, Bosworth remained bullish on Facebook's ad-targeting technology, which for better or worse has brought the company unwanted attention in the wake of last year's U.S. presidential election.
President Donald Trump's advertising manager has credited the technology with helping him win the contest.
Yet its use by a Russian propaganda group has prompted members of Congress to call for new laws restricting online political ads.
Bosworth, who has described himself (on Twitter) as ""the leader of the ads organization at the time of the election,"" believes the technology is just getting started.
""I believe we are still only at the early stages of what personalized marketing at scale is capable of,""  Bosworth wrote in his August post.
As for his new job, he added: ""I don't know much about consumer hardware. But I still believe in the power of human connection...I can't wait to get started.""
If Bosworth can build hardware as powerful as Facebook's ad technology, Zuckerberg's faith in him may be proven well-founded once again.

Examples of the way Facebook’s planned subscription tool will work on Android phones.
 Facebook's effort to help media companies sell subscriptions has hit a snag: Apple.
The two companies are butting heads over  Facebook's plan for a new subscription tool in its mobile app. The tool will put paywalls around some articles in Facebook's news feed, and then send users to publishers' sites to buy subscriptions.
The issue: Apple wants to take as much as 30 percent of any subscription revenue Facebook helps generate. Facebook wants all of the money to go to publishers.
 People familiar with both companies say they've been discussing the impasse for months. In the meantime, Facebook says it is rolling out a version of the subscription tool that will work on Android phones in the next few weeks; it says it will work with publishers including the Washington Post, Hearst and Tronc.
That tool will allow publishers to use two kinds of paywalls around ""Instant Articles"" that Facebook hosts on its mobile apps — a ""metered"" version, which turns on after Facebook users have read 10 of the publisher's articles in a month, and a ""freemium"" version, where publishers can put paywalls around individual articles.
In both cases, users who hit the paywall will be sent to the publisher's site to sign up for a subscription. Facebook has previously said it won't take any of the money publishers generate from subscription sales, and won't capture customer data generated in the transaction.
The hang-up with Apple stems from the company's rules about subscriptions sold inside apps on its iOS platform. Apple takes a cut of up to 30 percent of subscription revenue from ""in app"" sales.
And even though Facebook's plan calls for users to sign up for subscriptions outside of its apps, on publishers' individual web sites, Apple officials consider that an ""in-app"" purchase, since the impetus for the transaction kicked off inside Facebook's app.
That rule is meant to prevent, say, Spotify or Amazon from telling Apple users to leave the app and sign up for subscriptions on their own sites, as a way to dodge Apple's tax. People familiar with Facebook's plans say Google won't take a cut of subscriptions users sign up for using its Android operating system.
Apple declined to comment. Facebook didn't comment on its dispute with Apple, but outlined its plan to launch the subscription tool today in a blog post, and offered this comment from Campbell Brown, the former journalist it has hired to work with news publishers:
""We know subscriptions are an important business model for many in the news industry, that's why we've been working hand-in-hand with publishers to create a product that will drive real value for them. We're committed to this effort and optimistic that we'll launch a test on all mobile platforms soon.""
The friction over Apple's app rules is an echo of  earlier disputes Apple had with publishers, when it first set up rules about subscription sales.
Apple's initial rules about in-app subscriptions date back to 2011, when  publishers were spending a lot of time thinking about how they would sell subscriptions via iPads. Publishers' ambitions for that device  never panned out, but they're still interested in getting people to pay them for content.
About 45 percent of U.S. smartphone users have Apple iPhones,  according to comScore, with most of the remaining 55 percent using Android devices. But iOS users have always been  bigger spenders on paid services.
Facebook, meanwhile, says its efforts to help publishers sell subscriptions is an outgrowth of its  Facebook Journalism Project, a long to-do list of things the social network says it wants to do to create a ""healthy news ecosystem"" — an effort that got a jolt of energy following the 2016 election.
Note that not every publisher likes Facebook's subscription plan. Notable holdouts from the test plan the company is announcing today include the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
Some publishers have previously complained that they want to be able to set the terms of the paywall, instead of letting Facebook determine how many times readers can view their stories for free.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook ad revenue is on the way up, according to a new note from Mizuho tech analyst James Lee.
 The company is predicting Facebook will show 8 percent ad revenue growth compared with last quarter, above the 6 percent consensus estimate. 
Facebook is projected to make $17.37 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer. Facebook also takes home 20.9 percent of U.S. digital ad revenue, ranking it second behind Google. (Facebook reports earnings on Nov 1.)
 Growth in ad revenue is partially attributable to two sources: Facebook mobile and Instagram ads. Facebook mobile ad CPMs — a unit of ad price measurement based on 1,000 impressions — increased 29 percent quarter over quarter to $5.66, according to a leading digital agency Mizuho spoke with. Instagram also saw gains and went up to $5.46, up 23 percent. 
The digital agency sources attributed the mobile ad price increase to Facebook's efforts to moderate ad load, or prevent the platform from becoming oversaturated with ads. When platforms have too many ads, users get turned off. 
Instagram's increases were due to more demand for entertainment ad space, according to the note. Most of Facebook's ads are bought auction-style, meaning more demand increases the price. Entertainment is the biggest vertical for advertisers across all of Facebook's properties, making up 39 percent of advertiser spend, Mizuho said. More companies were also using direct response Instagram ads, which encourage users to take action immediately including to ""shop now"" or ""learn more,"" Mizuho pointed out. 
Mizuho maintained its buy rating on Facebook.

 People will be able to read 10 articles for free via the social network's Instant Articles feature before being prompted to subscribe for full access as part of the experiment,  Facebook executives said in a blog post Thursday.
When someone subscribes, the transaction will take place on the publisher's website, and the publisher will keep all of the revenue as well as own subscribers' data.
 Facebook has been eating publishers' lunch, taking ad dollars that historically went to traditional media owners. Google and Facebook topped a list of the world's largest media owners in May, together earning more than $100 billion in advertising dollars in 2016, according to media agency Zenith.

 Google, Facebook dominate digital ad space: WWP CEO   
 7:11  AM ET Fri,  4 Aug 2017 |  03:22 
 In July, U.S. publishers' group the News Media Alliance went to Congress to allow it to collectively regain market share from Facebook and Google. Antitrust laws usually prevent companies from forming such an alliance because of the risk of over-dominance, but the group sought an exemption.
For its part, the social media giant set up the Facebook Journalism Project in January to develop news projects, as well as look at how publishers can make money from the site.
""Earlier this year, many publishers identified subscriptions as a top priority, so we worked with a diverse group of partners to design, refine, and develop a test suited for a variety of premium news models,"" Facebook's Campbell Brown, head of news partnerships, Alex Hardiman, head of news product, and Sameera Salari, product manager, wrote in the blog post.
But some notable premium publishers, including The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times, will not take part in the subscription experiment because Facebook will not give them access to readers' data until they subscribe, a Reuters report said.

 Facebook is making a new push into the payments space by expanding its partnership with PayPal.
 Facebook Messenger users can now send and request money directly in the app via their PayPal accounts.
Facebook Messenger and PayPal initially partnered last year to enable customers to link their accounts and use PayPal to shop on Messenger. The new announcement expands the partnership into peer-to-peer payments. 
 At the moment, the peer-to-peer payments system is only available in the U.S., where PayPal has over 2.5 million accounts that are already linked to Facebook. 
Additionally, PayPal customers can now use a customer service chat bot in Messenger allowing them to reset passwords, handle account inquiries and helping with payment issues in the app.
Facebook has been working on bringing payments to its platforms for some time, and this latest push makes it a competitor to other peer-to-peer payments options such as Apple's new Pay Cash, Square Cash, Snapchat's payments and PayPal's own Venmo application.
Correction: 2.5 million PayPal accounts are linked to Facebook in the U.S. The company had more than 218 million customer accounts worldwide as of Sept. 30, and 99 million in the U.S. as of Q2.

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook
 Facebook may make it harder for people to see publishers' stories, unless those publishers pay to promote them.
As part of a new test in six countries, Facebook is taking content from publishers and businesses out of its main feed. Instead, those posts will exist in a separate, hard-to-find feed that Facebook recently launched for discovering new stuff, called the ""Explore Feed.""
The Explore Feed's purpose is to show users posts from people or publishers they don't follow, in the hope that they'll find new stuff they wouldn't otherwise see. In some countries, though, the social giant is also testing putting all publisher content in this secondary feed, even if you do follow those publishers.

 Facebook says the point is to give people two feeds: One with stuff from their friends and family, and the other from businesses and publishers. Here's the full statement from Facebook:
 ""With all of the possible stories in each person's feed, we always work to connect people with the posts they find most meaningful. People have told us they want an easier way to see posts from friends and family, so we are testing two separate feeds, one as a dedicated space with posts from friends and family and another as a dedicated space for posts from Pages. To understand if people like these two different spaces, we will test a few things, such as how people engage with videos and other types of posts. These tests will start in Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Slovakia, Serbia, Guatemala, and Cambodia. We have no current plans to roll this out globally."" 
Though Facebook claims it doesn't plan to roll this out globally right now, the fact that Facebook is even testing it should be terrifying for publishers, almost all of whom rely heavily on Facebook's News Feed for distribution. The new Explore Feed is not easy to find. It's buried on the lefthand rail on Facebook's web version, or in the ""Explore"" tab on the iOS app. In my case, it took three taps from the News Feed in order to find it.
 tweet
 Facebook exec Adam Mosseri, who oversees News Feed, shed a little more light on the test in a series of tweets on Monday. He listed a number of metrics Facebook looks at when determining whether to roll out a test more broadly.
""We look at what people say and what people do — do they comment, like and share more? are they happier when asked? do they spend more time?"" he tweeted.
Mosseri also said that a decision on whether or not to roll out the two-feed system to everyone is likely still a ways off.
""Most ranking changes are tested for days or weeks, but given how significant a change this is we'll likely run it for months,"" he tweeted.
Regardless of whether or not Facebook chooses to roll this out fully, it's yet another reminder of how important Facebook has become for the media world, and for news distribution in particular. (Two-thirds of Americans claim to get some news from social media.) Facebook has a long history of changing the rules on a whim, leaving publishers scrambling to keep up.
It's possible Facebook will see the same data publishers are seeing in Slovakia and decide hiding publisher Pages isn't a good idea after all. It's also possible the opposite could happen. Most Facebook changes start as tests before they are turned on for good, like when the company started testing autoplay videos with the sound on last August. It rolled it out to everyone in February.

 In response to a request for comment on the Vice report, CZI referred CNBC to its prior public announcements about funding for work around criminal justice and housing, including advocacy work supporting those issues.
Zuckerberg's investments, paired with a tour of the U.S., have drawn comparisons to a presidential campaign. But David Plouffe, former Obama advisor and policy boss at CZI, told Vice News those rumors were ""silly"" and ""political scuttlebutt.""

72,2017-10-25,Microsoft's new studios create Mixed Reality holograms  ,"Satish Bate | Hindustan Times | Getty Images
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers his keynotes at the company’s flagship technology and business conference -- Future Decoded 2017 in Mumbai, India.
 Microsoft is opening its first Mixed Reality capture studios in San Francisco and London, allowing developers and creators to create holograms from real life objects. Microsoft has been using its own studio at its Redmond headquarters to capture Buzz Aldrin, Reggie Watts, Max Frost, and Cirque Du Soleil performances and bring them into virtual reality and augmented reality holograms.
 The new studios in San Francisco, London, and Redmond will allow third parties to create holograms that can be used on regular 2D screens, a HoloLens device, or even Microsoft's new Windows Mixed Reality (VR) headsets. Microsoft will be licensing these studios, and it's likely to be an expensive process to capture items as holograms.
Microsoft is pitching these studios more to producers, musicians, athletes, and dancers. The software giant is also expanding its Mixed Reality Academy program to San Francisco, with a range of workshops designed to teach the basics of developing apps and experiences for VR and HoloLens headsets.
 Microsoft's new studios come just as the augmented reality wars between Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Facebook begin. Tech companies are trying to bring some type of AR experience mainstream, and a tight integration of hardware and software will be key to convince consumers that mixed reality computing is the next major shift beyond PCs, laptops, and smartphones.

73,2017-10-26,"Facebook says 30,000 businesses now use its Slack competitor, Workplace  Billionaire investor Peter Thiel: Silicon Valley’s monopoly on big growth tech companies is over  This social media giant is set to make big moves on earnings next week  ","Photo by Bloomberg 
 Facebook's Slack competitor is growing quickly.
A year after Facebook  officially launched Workplace, an enterprise version of its social network for communicating with your co-workers, the company has 30,000 businesses using the service, up from roughly 1,000 businesses a year ago and 14,000 businesses six months ago.
Facebook is also launching new features for Workplace, including a group video chat feature and a desktop chat app so users can send messages back and forth without the need to have Facebook open in their browser.
 Facebook pushes hard into a lot of different products, and the ones that don't work out usually fade away. The fact that Facebook is still building new features for Workplace — and touting new growth milestones — shows that the company is taking its push into enterprise pretty seriously despite a slow start. (Facebook was  building the product for years before its official launch.)
But while 30,000 businesses customers feels like a lot, it's a little tough to put into perspective.
Facebook is not sharing how many of those businesses are paying customers, for example — Facebook rolled out a free version of Workplace in April and also offers the service for free to nonprofits and educational institutions.
Facebook also doesn't share how many users it has, just total businesses. Slack, the highly valued Silicon Valley startup that offers a similar office tool,  claims more than four million users. As a result, you can't really compare the two (which is probably the point).
We also don't know how much revenue Workplace brings in. That's not uncommon for Facebook. The social network doesn't even break out revenue for Instagram, and that business is much older and estimated to be pretty big. But it makes it tough to understand just how successful Workplace has been.
Still, Facebook's push into enterprise is worth watching. The company makes almost all of its revenue from advertising, and Workplace provides Facebook with a subscription product at a time when it's  hunting for revenue businesses outside of the core Facebook News Feed.

 });Peter Thiel is a heavyweight entrepreneur and investor who made his career in Silicon Valley. He launched and took public online payments company PayPal, was an early investor in Facebook and Airbnb and went on to launch software company Palantir Technologies. But now the billionaire says that Silicon Valley's monopoly on technology company growth is over.
 ""I have been investing in the technology space — entrepreneur and investor over the past 20 years in Silicon Valley — and within the area of IT, it has for the last 10, 15 years in the US and the world been extremely centered on Silicon Valley,"" Thiel says, speaking at the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Thursday.
""I think there are a lot of reasons for that, but the question is, 'Where is the growth going to happen the next 10 years?' And what I would tend to think is that it will be more diversified from just Silicon Valley.""
 The concentration of global tech companies in one small region in California has been a peculiar feature of the industry.
 ""There was something very paradoxical about it all being in Silicon Valley, because after all these Internet companies are global in scope,"" Thiel says. ""They can be built anywhere. You just need some talented people, some capital, the right governance structures and so it was always this very odd question, why all the companies of this new global technology were built in one specific place.""

 Until this point, the growth of successful tech companies being nearly monopolized in Silicon Valley has been largely due to the concentration of knowledge about entrepreneurship and the presence of mentors, Thiel says.
""The answers for that had to do with network effects and knowledge and role models, but I think at this point, I would bet on places outside of Silicon Valley.""

But when Thiel is thinking about where the next big technology deals will be, he thinks globally.
""The one big place outside of Silicon Valley over the last few years has been China, where there have been some spectacular companies started,"" Thiel says. ""I don't think there is a single other place, it is not a specific city or specific country, but I think in general there is much opportunity outside of Silicon Valley.""

 Tech stocks are on fire, will Apple and Facebook join the party next?   
 6:56  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  04:44 
 Big tech is getting bigger.
 Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, the world's five most valuable public companies, added $181 billion to their combined market value on Friday.
Investors piled into the group a day after Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings.
 For the stock market, it was more of the same. Those five companies have gained almost $900 billion in market capitalization over the past year. They've each outperformed the S&P 500 in 2017, and have been the top contributors to the index's 15 percent gain.
Despite potential political and regulatory pressures on Google, Facebook and Amazon and loud voices of concern about the tech giants hurting competition and controlling too much of our data, the stock moves reflect financial performance. And the performance is staggering.

 People are clicking on more Google ads. Amazon, which picked up $62 billion in stock market value on Friday, is delivering more of everything. Those two companies plus Microsoft are picking up share of the rapidly growing cloud-computing market. 
Even though Facebook and Apple don't report results until next week, investors drove the stocks up on Friday to the tune of a combined $51.4 billion. Facebook is projected to record 40 percent sales growth on Wednesday. The next day, Apple is expected to report growth of more than 8 percent, thanks to sales of 46 million iPhones, according to FactSet. 
The tech leaders pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to record closes on Friday. Rallies don't last forever, but investors aren't finding many reasons to bet against tech.

 With two-thirds of its population under 30 and an economy it is keen to diversify away from oil dependence, Saudi Arabia offers fertile ground for foreign expenditure.
 But according to one investment bank chief executive CNBC spoke to, it is technology behemoths from China, and not the U.S., that will win the race to capture this lucrative market.
""China's large tech companies like Alibaba and Tencent have a conglomerate structure and are pursuing more businesses than their U.S. counterparts like Google or Facebook,"" Fan Bao, CEO of China Renaissance, told CNBC.
 Bao explained that ""housing a diversity of businesses under one roof"" is useful for ""attracting top engineering talent,"" key for emerging markets in which workers with the right knowledge base can be difficult to source.

 In addition, Bao added that ""a critical aspect of the Chinese business model is the ability to work with the government."" Feeling comfortable when operating in close contact with the state ""can be particularly effective in countries like Saudi Arabia and the Middle East, where the government has a large role to play in economic growth and development.""
Business with a relative lack of autonomy from the government can also bring positives. Mohamed Abdelmeguid, Middle East and Africa analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC: ""The Saudi government, with its large holdings of assets, can provide sovereign guarantees that lessen the risk factor for a given investment—particularly at a time of low oil prices.""
Regardless of these assurances, Abdelmeguid agreed with Bao that Chinese companies are more comfortable than their U.S. counterparts when moving into early-stage markets. This is exemplified by Beijing's Belt and Road initiative, an umbrella term for the Middle Kingdom's push beyond its borders in the world's largest foreign investment project.

 Facebook to give more transparency on political ads   
 2:04  PM ET Fri, 27 Oct 2017 |  00:47 
 Facebook is trying to make it easier to identify political ads in your News Feed.
The social giant announced on Friday it will soon require advertisers — especially political candidates — to disclose more information about their advertising efforts on the platform as the company seeks to temper concerns from the U.S. Congress about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Facebook's new policies include labeling political ads so they're easier to identify, and creating a catalogue of these and other ads so users can see how much advertisers are paying and who they are targeting.
 But many of the changes intended to create more transparency  don't appear to address the most problematic ads purchased last year by Kremlin-backed, online trolls. These ads, referred to as ""issue ads,"" sought to stir social and political unrest in the United States around issues like Black Lives Matter, not necessarily to promote candidates like Donald Trump.
Still, the announcements Friday come as Facebook prepares for what could be a brutal grilling before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. The panels are investigating Russia's suspected interference in the 2016 presidential election, and they'll also hear from senior executives at Google and Twitter during back-to-back hearings on Nov. 1.
Under the new policy, Facebook is making two new, key demands of its broad universe of advertisers.
First, political campaigns and advocacy groups that seek to run election-time ads about a federal candidate must indicate — to the company and users alike — that they're doing so. Those ads, when presented to Facebook users, will have a new feature in which viewers can swipe up to learn more about the political candidate.
Meanwhile, Facebook will set up a new hub for all advertisers — political or otherwise — where users can see all current ad campaigns running on the site. For these ads, marketers will also have to share basic demographic targeting information.
Facebook plans to begin testing these new disclosure policies in Canada before rolling them out in the United States in time for the 2018 midterm elections. Initially, they'll only show active ads, the company said in a blog post Friday. But once the new system rolls out in the U.S., Facebook will begin building a searchable, four-year archive of political ads run on its site.

Facebook, Google and Twitter might face yet another grilling by U.S. lawmakers angry about their algorithmsWhat will Facebook, Twitter and Google do about Russia?Bill Gates is the richest man in the world. This is how he gives away his billions.
Facebook isn't the only company promising greater transparency around political ads. Twitter, for example,  has revealed its own changes designed to make political ads more transparent, similar to Facebook's new policies. Google might soon do the same. And all of these pledges seem designed with one goal in mind: Staving off federal regulation.
Lawmakers like Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee,  are pushing potential new laws that would require large tech and advertising platforms to make much more information available about the political ads they run. But Facebook and its peers haven't exactly endorsed the plan, called the Honest Ads Act. Instead, they've sought to prove they can regulate themselves.
For its part, Facebook disagreed with the assessment that its announcements Friday are meant to ward off the U.S. Congress.
""We are trying to urgently fix the problem,"" said Rob Goldman, the company's vice president of product for ads and pages, in an interview before the announcement. He stressed that the company ""feel[s] strongly about what happened.""
Previously, though, Facebook lobbied against more extensive political ad disclosure rules. And the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, also initially rejected the influence of Russian trolls on his own platform before ultimately admitting that dismissal was a bad idea. Facebook then promised to  hire 1,000 new workers to monitor ads.
Still, the new details announced Friday might not satisfy Facebook's federal overseers. For one thing, the changes don't apply to those so-called ""issue ads"" — think political endeavors around immigration, gun control or gay rights that don't actually involve a federal candidate by name.
It's precisely those sort of ads that Russian trolls purchased around the 2016 election. At times, suspicious Kremlin-tied profiles and pages even took both sides of controversial issues in the hopes of creating social and political tensions on the platform. But they would only trigger Facebook's new transparency guidelines if they mentioned a candidate by name. The new bill by Warner and crew, in contrast, seems to cover these issue-based ads.
And Facebook's revised system is largely the stuff of self regulation: The burden is on political candidates and campaigns, as well as their allies, to disclose their efforts to Facebook. For now, the company hopes that's enough — and believes its users, on top of its previous pledges to invest more in people and technology to monitor ads, can spot anyone failing to self-identify as a political advertiser.
Nevertheless, the announcements by Facebook on Friday still amount to a new, major change for the company, as it endeavors to demystify why its users see the ads they do. Even with limited information about ad targeting centralized in one place — data including age and gender — viewers and watchdog groups alike can keep closer watch over the platform.
And Facebook's Goldman suggested to Recode there could be more to come. Asked about the absence of issue ads in its new policy, he said: ""Over time we may roll out features like this in other places or other ways.""

Facebook denies listening to user conversations via microphones  Apple and Tesla earnings will beat the Street, investors say  There’s a ‘tug of war’ happening within large tech companies: Portfolio manager  ","Getty Images
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg
 For months, Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., has been in crisis mode, furiously attempting to contain the damage stemming from its role in last year’s presidential campaign. The company has mounted an all-out defense campaign ahead of this week’s congressional hearings on election interference in 2016, hiring three outside communications firms, taking out full-page newspaper ads, and mobilizing top executives, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, to beat back accusations that it failed to prevent Russia from manipulating the outcome of the election.
No other predicament in Facebook’s 13-year history has generated this kind of four-alarm response. But while the focus on Russia is understandable, Facebook has been much less vocal about the abuse of its services in other parts of the world, where the stakes can be much higher than an election.
This past week, my colleagues at The Times reported on the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims, an ethnic minority in Myanmar that has been subjected to brutal violence and mass displacement. Violence against the Rohingya has been fueled, in part, by misinformation and anti-Rohingya propaganda spread on Facebook, which is used as a primary news source by many people in the country. Doctored photos and unfounded rumors have gone viral on Facebook, including many shared by official government and military accounts.
 The information war in Myanmar illuminates a growing problem for Facebook. The company successfully connected the world to a constellation of real-time communication and broadcasting tools, then largely left it to deal with the consequences.
“In a lot of these countries, Facebook is the de facto public square,” said Cynthia Wong, a senior internet researcher for Human Rights Watch. “Because of that, it raises really strong questions about Facebook needing to take on more responsibility for the harms their platform has contributed to.”
In Myanmar, the rise in anti-Rohingya sentiment coincided with a huge boom in social media use that was partly attributable to Facebook itself. In 2016, the company partnered with MTP, the state-run telecom company, to give subscribers access to its Free Basics program. Free Basics includes a limited suite of internet services, including Facebook, that can be used without counting toward a cellphone data plan. As a result, the number of Facebook users in Myanmar has skyrocketed to more than 30 million today from 2 million in 2014.
“We work hard to educate people about our services, highlight tools to help them protect their accounts and promote digital literacy,” said Debbie Frost, a Facebook spokeswoman. “To be more effective in these efforts, we are working with civil society, safety partners, and governments — an approach we have found to be particularly important and effective in countries where people are rapidly coming online and experiencing the internet for the first time through a mobile phone.”
In India, where internet use has also surged in recent years, WhatsApp, the popular Facebook-owned messaging app, has been inundated with rumors, hoaxes and false stories. In May, the Jharkhand region in Eastern India was destabilized by a viral WhatsApp message that falsely claimed that gangs in the area were abducting children. The message incited widespread panic and led to a rash of retaliatory lynchings, in which at least seven people were beaten to death. A local filmmaker, Vinay Purty, told the Hindustan Times that many of the local villagers simply believed the abduction myth was real, since it came from WhatsApp.
“Everything shared on the phone is regarded as true,” Mr. Purty said.
In a statement, WhatsApp said, “WhatsApp has made communications cheaper, easier and more reliable for millions of Indians — with all the benefits that brings. Though we understand that some people, sadly, have used WhatsApp to intimidate others and spread misinformation. It’s why we encourage people to report problematic messages to WhatsApp so that we can take action.”

Facebook is not directly responsible for violent conflict, of course, and viral misinformation is hardly unique to its services. Before social media, there were email hoaxes and urban legends passed from person to person. But the speed of Facebook’s growth in the developing world has made it an especially potent force among first-time internet users, who may not be appropriately skeptical of what they see online.
The company has made many attempts to educate users about the dangers of misinformation. In India and Malaysia, it has taken out newspaper ads with tips for spotting false news. In Myanmar, it has partnered with local organizations to distribute printed copies of its community standards, as well as created educational materials to teach citizens about proper online behavior.
But these efforts, as well-intentioned as they may be, have not stopped the violence, and Facebook does not appear to have made them a top priority. The company has no office in Myanmar, and neither Mr. Zuckerberg nor Ms. Sandberg has made any public statements about the Rohingya crisis.
Correcting misinformation is a thorny philosophical problem for Facebook, which imagines itself as a neutral platform that avoids making editorial decisions. Facebook’s community standards prohibit hate speech and threats, but many harmful viral posts — such as a WhatsApp thread in Southern India that spread false rumors about a government immunization campaign — are neither hateful nor directly threatening, and they wouldn’t be prohibited under Facebook’s community standards as long as they came from authentic accounts. Fighting misinformation is especially difficult on WhatsApp, an app for private messaging, since there is no public information trail to fact-check.
Facebook has argued that the benefits of providing internet access to international users will ultimately outweigh the costs. Adam Mosseri, a Facebook vice president who oversees the News Feed, told a journalism gathering this month, “In the end, I don’t think we as a human race will regret the internet.” Mr. Zuckerberg echoed that sentiment in a 2013 manifesto titled “Is Connectivity a Human Right?,” in which he said that bringing the world’s population online would be “one of the most important things we all do in our lifetimes.”
That optimism may be cold comfort to people in places like South Sudan. Despite being one of the poorest and least-wired countries in the world, with only around 20 percent of its citizens connected to the internet, the African nation has become a hotbed of social media misinformation. As BuzzFeed News has reported, political operatives inside and outside the country have used Facebook posts to spread rumors and incite anger between rival factions, fostering violence that threatens to escalate into a civil war. A United Nations report last year determined that in South Sudan, “social media has been used by partisans on all sides, including some senior government officials, to exaggerate incidents, spread falsehoods and veiled threats, or post outright messages of incitement.”
These are incredibly complex issues, and it may be impossible for Facebook — which is, remember, a technology company, not a global peacekeeping force — to solve them overnight. But as the company’s response to the Russia crisis has proved, it’s capable of acting swiftly and powerfully when it feels its interests are threatened.
Information wars in emerging markets may not represent as big a threat to Facebook’s business as angry lawmakers in Washington. But people are dying, and communities are tearing themselves apart with the tools Facebook has built. That should qualify as an even greater emergency in Menlo Park.

 A senior Facebook executive has denied the social network uses a device's microphone to listen in on real-life conversations in order to target people with relevant ads.
 In response to a tweet on Friday by PJ Vogt, the presenter of a technology podcast called Reply All, Facebook's Vice President of Ads Rob Goldman said it was ""just not true"" the tech giant used this practice.
Goldman said: ""I run ads product at Facebook. We don't — and have never — used your microphone for ads. Just not true.""
 Tweet 1
 In a statement published on its website last year, Facebook denied listening in to users via a microphone device. The tech giant said: ""We only access your microphone if you have given our app permission and if you are actively using a specific feature that requires audio.""
PJ Vogt received hundreds of replies to his original tweet Friday, with several people claiming they had seen adverts which appeared to be related to recent conversations.
""A co-worker got an ad saying, 'So you popped the question!' minutes after he proposed, before he told anyone it had happened,"" Tori Hoover said in response to PJ Vogt.

 David Hand, a mathematics professor from Imperial College London, told the BBC that while some feel as though such coincidences could not just happen by chance, people are generally more alert to things that are currently occupying them.
""If you take something that has a tiny chance of occurring and give it enough opportunities to occur, it inevitably will happen,"" he added.

Apple CEO Tim Cook
 This will be a busy week for Wall Street as a quarter of the S&P 500 reports earnings. But investors think there are 10 companies that will provide positive surprises.
 CNBC used Estimize, which pools thousands of estimates from real investors and traders, to sort through the many companies reporting over the next week and find the ones where this group had higher expectations than the standard Wall Street consensus estimate from analysts.
About 55 percent of the S&P 500 has reported earnings and another 25 percent is on tap this week. Those companies include Facebook, Apple, Starbucks and Tesla. They are also among the companies forecast to report better-than-expected earnings, according to estimates from Estimize.
 All but three of the 10 companies reporting this week have a history of topping the Street, too.

 Apple, a Dow component, is scheduled to report earnings Thursday after the bell and should report a profit of $1.89 per share, according to Estimize. That would be 3 cents above consensus. The iPhone maker has also beaten the Street 57 percent of the time, according to Estimize.
Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba said in a note on Oct. 17 that he sees Apple earnings per share coming in line with Wall Street estimates or slightly above expectations. ""We expect management to remain focused on the cost side,"" Lamba said.

 He also said he sees little upside in iPhone shipments — a key metric for the tech giant — ""given the fact that no iPhone X shipments occurred during the September quarter as well as the largely incremental nature of iPhone 8 features announced.""
Lamba has a neutral rating and a $160 price target on Apple; it traded above $166 on Monday.
Apple shares hit a record high on Monday, helping lift the Nasdaq composite to an all-time high. The stock is up 43 percent year to date, easily outperforming the broader S&P 500.
Tesla, meanwhile, will report a loss of $2.27 a share, which is better than the expected Wall Street loss of $2.45, according to Estimize. However, the company has a history of disappointing Wall Street, topping estimates just 32 percent of the time, according to Estimize.
Analysts at UBS also slashed their full-year earnings forecast for Tesla, predicting more production problems with its Model 3 car.
""We believe the market should not ignore fundamental challenges that persist with regards to Tesla's Model 3 profitability, stationary storage & solar businesses, and eventual need to raise cash,"" UBS analyst Colin Langan said in a note.
Tesla shares are up 50.1 percent for the year. The company is set to report Wednesday after the close.
Facebook and Starbucks will also beat the Street, according to Estimize. Shares of Facebook are up 56 percent in 2017 while Starbucks is nearly flat. Facebook is scheduled to report Wednesday after the bell and Starbucks will report Thursday after the close.

76,2017-10-31,"Facebook says 126 million people in the U.S. may have seen posts produced by Russian-government-backed agents  Facebook pledges to double its 10,000-person safety and security staff by end of 2018  Tech companies to testify about Russian-linked activity on Capitol Hill  Here's how to trade Facebook going into earnings  Execs from Facebook and Twitter face lawmakers on Capitol Hill  Facebook, Google and Twitter will want to avoid more regulation  How to Fix Facebook? We Asked 9 Experts  Buy Facebook before earnings because of likely strong ad revenue: Deutsche Bank WPP CEO: Facebook and Google have responded to advertising challenges  126 million people possibly exposed to Russian-linked ads on Facebook  Big tech to testify before Senate on Russian-linked activity  ","Facebook, Google and Twitter plan to tell congressional investigators this week that the scope of Russia's campaign to spread disinformation on their sites — and to potentially disrupt the 2016 U.S. presidential race — is much broader than the companies initially reported.
At Facebook, roughly 126 million users in the United States may have seen posts, stories or other content created by Russian government-backed trolls around Election Day, according to a source familiar with the company's forthcoming testimony to Congress. Previously, Facebook had only shared information on ads purchased by Kremlin-tied accounts, revealing that they  reached more than 10 million U.S. users.
Google, which previously had not commented on its internal investigation, will break its silence: In a forthcoming blog post, the search giant confirmed that it discovered about $4,700 worth of search-and-display ads with dubious Russian ties. It also reported 18 YouTube channels associated with the Kremlin's disinformation efforts, as well as a number of Gmail addresses that ""were used to open accounts on other platforms.""
 More from Recode:Sen. Feinstein is demanding more information from Facebook and Twitter about Russian users on their sitesRussian meddling in the 2016 election: Facebook, Twitter, and Google are testifying to CongressCoursera has ousted several senior executives along with many rank-and-file staffers
 And Twitter will tell Congress that it found more than 2,700 accounts tied to a known Russian-sponsored organization called the Internet Research Agency, according to sources familiar with its testimony. Twitter initially informed lawmakers about  just 200 known accounts. The company will also release a new study that shows the extent to which Russian-based automated accounts, or bots, of all sorts tweet on its platform.
In sharing these findings with  congressional investigators, the three tech giants plan to emphasize that Russian-fostered disinformation — while troubling — amounted to only a small portion of the ads and other content published regularly on their platforms. Facebook, for example, hopes to highlight that its U.S. users are served more than 200 stories in their News Feeds each day, according to a source familiar with its thinking.
Still, the companies' explanations may not satisfy an ever-expanding chorus of critics on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers are increasingly demanding that Facebook, Google and Twitter step up their efforts to counter the Kremlin's attempts to sow political and social discord —  or else face more regulation by the U.S. government.
For the tech industry, the first test comes on Tuesday: A crime- and terrorism-focused committee led by Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham will grill Colin Stretch, the general counsel of Facebook; Richard Salgado, the director of law enforcement and information security at Google; and Sean Edgett, the acting general counsel of Twitter.
On Wednesday, Facebook's Stretch and Twitter's Edgett will return to the Capitol and submit to two back-to-back sessions before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. There, they'll be joined by Kent Walker, the general counsel of Google.
Upon entering the hearings, these tech giants each pledged to improve their handling of political advertising — seemingly in a bid to  stave off congressional scrutiny.  Facebook and  Twitter, for example, in October promised more manual review of those ads, along with greater disclosure as to who is paying for them in the first place.
And Google newly revealed on Monday that it would do the same. The company announced that it sought to create a new database for election ads purchased on AdWords and YouTube, along with stronger disclosure rules and a new ad transparency report due in 2018. Google said it would also put in place new procedures to verify that advertisers running political ads are based in the U.S.
But lawmakers' concerns aren't limited to ads. Members of Congress are likely to press some tech executives on their handling of organic posts — the stories, status updates or other content published and shared on social media sites without cost. In many ways, this content is harder to identify, and at times it is impossible to regulate in a way that doesn't trigger free-speech concerns.
At Facebook, for example, Russian trolls created 80,000 pieces of organic content between January 2015 and August 2017, the company plans to tell lawmakers at the hearing. About 29 million Americans saw those posts directly in their News Feed over that two-year period. And those users also liked, shared and followed these posts and pages, exposing them to their friends — meaning 126 million U.S. users in total might have seen at least some Russian-generated content, according to a source familiar with the findings.
On Instagram, meanwhile, Facebook deleted roughly 170 accounts tied to Russian trolls that posted about 120,000 pieces of content, the company plans to reveal in its testimony.
Taken together, those organic posts had a much greater reach than the 3,000 ads purchased by Russian agents on Facebook around Election Day. In October, the company provided key congressional committees with copies of the ads, which sought to sow social and political unrest around contentious topics, including immigration and Black Lives Matter.
Muck like its peers, though, Facebook plans to stress to U.S. lawmakers that the activity represents only a fraction of what happens daily on its site. Russian-generated disinformation during the election amounted to four-thousandths (0.004) of one percent of content in the News Feed, according to a source familiar with the company's findings.
Google, meanwhile, plans to tell Congress that it ""found only limited activity on our services,"" wrote general counsel Walker and Salgado, a company security executive, in a blog post published before the hearing.
Initially, sources had flagged $4,700 in ad spending by Russia's so-called Internet Research Agency, and Google finally confirmed the number Monday. In doing so, it said search and display ads were not targeted based on users' geography or political preferences.
Its audit of YouTube, meanwhile, turned up 18 channels tied to Russian trolls, which had uploaded 1,108 videos. In total, they had been viewed roughly 309,000 times between June 2015 and November 2017; about 3 percent of those videos had more than 3,000 views. The channels have been suspended.
Yet one of Google's biggest challenges — much like Facebook and Twitter — is its handling of organic content, including videos uploaded by RT, a Russian government-funded news network. Called a propaganda arm of the Kremlin, RT videos have millions of views on YouTube. In Google's investigation, however, the tech giant said it ""found no evidence of manipulation of our platform or policy violations."" As a result, Google said that RT and other state-sponsored media outlets are still ""subject to our standard rules.""
Twitter, for its part, recently banned RT from advertising on its platform, though the publication is still allowed to tweet there. Facebook has announced no change.
For its part, Twitter plans to unveil two new key findings during its testimony to Congress, sources told Recode on Monday. Chief among them: The company's acting general counsel, Edgett, will note that the company had discovered — and suspended — roughly 2,752 accounts tied to known Kremlin trolls.
Initially, Twitter pegged this number at about 200 accounts. And while the company at the time described it as an early estimate, it still faced sharp criticism from lawmakers like Sen. Mark Warner, who charged that the company hadn't done an exhaustive investigation.
Twitter also sought to study election-related tweets sent between Sept. 1 and Nov. 15, 2016. Among a pool of 189 million tweets, the company identified about 1.4 million sent by automated Russian-affiliated accounts.
In Twitter's estimation, that's less than three-quarters of a percent of all of the election-sampled tweets sent using its service over a roughly two-month window — and Edgett will stress they ""underperformed"" in generating impressions on the site when compared to an average, normal tweet. In contrast, Twitter also noted that tweets from accounts including WikiLeaks tended to benefit from significantly more engagement by Russian bots.

Colin Stretch, general counsel for Facebook arrives to testify before Senate Judiciary Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee hearing on on ""ways to combat and reduce the amount of Russian propaganda and extremist content online,"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 31, 2017.
 Facebook, under intensifying pressure from legislators and consumers to clean up its site, is pledging to double the number of people it has working on issues related to safety and security.
 Colin Stretch,  a vice president and general counsel at Facebook, testified before senators on Tuesday alongside executives from Twitter and Google. He told them that Facebook's staff focused on sensitive security and community issues will grow to 20,000 by the end of next year.
""Today, across our safety, security, and product and community operation teams, we have about 10,000 people who are working on safety and security generally,"" Stretch said during a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing related to Russian interference in the 2016 election. ""We're committed to investing more and doubling that number by the end of 2018.""
 That's an enormous personnel commitment for Facebook. As of June 30, the company had a total of 20,658 employees. The groups that specifically focus on terrorist content include thousands of workers broadly and 150 who spend all their time removing terrorism-related content, Stretch said. 
In 2016, Facebook's total headcount grew from 12,691 employees to 17,048.
Facebook has already said that it would hire 3,000 content moderators to review and take down videos of violence and suicide attempts. The company also previously said it would hire 1,000 more people to review and take down ads. 
This additional 10,000 is inclusive of the 4,000 already planned. The company said some of the new hires will be contractors. 
The testimony comes just ahead of Facebook's quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, and amid a series of congressional hearings on the role of advertising companies in the election.
Facebook has told investors for some time that it would continue to invest in staffing, despite slowing revenue growth. In its last annual report, Facebook said rising costs were largely the result of increased hiring in research and development and sales and marketing.
Facebook shares were little changed in extended trading after closing at $180.06 on Tuesday.

Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook
 Colin Stretch, the general counsel of Facebook, will appear on Tuesday before senators who are investigating how Russia spread misinformation online during the 2016 presidential campaign. Along with Google and Twitter, Facebook has been blamed for helping Russian agents influence the outcome of the election.
But the cloud over Facebook extends far beyond Russia. Critics say the company’s central role in modern communication has undermined the news business, split Americans into partisan echo chambers and “hijacked” our minds with a product designed to keep us addicted to the social network.
More from The New York Times:
 Mark Warner: Tech Millionaire Who Became Tech's Critic in CongressWhat Virtual Reality Can Teach a Driverless CarSamsung Unveils New Management to Quell Leadership Crisis
Of course, criticism of Facebook and its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, is easy to come by; solutions aren’t as clear. We asked nine technologists, academics, politicians and journalists to propose the steps they would take to improve Facebook — as a product, a company or both.
Their responses, edited slightly for length and clarity, are below.
 Jonathan Albright
 Research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism.
With a recent Facebook change that algorithmically prioritizes “reactions” in the news feed over the standard “like,” the company appears to be pushing further into the realm of emotion-centered engagement. As they stand, and especially with algorithmic reinforcement, “reactions” and “likes” are like megaphones for echo chambers and news outrage.
The single most important step Facebook — and its subsidiary Instagram, which I view as equally important in terms of countering misinformation, hate speech and propaganda — can take is to abandon the focus on emotional signaling-as-engagement.
This is a tough proposition, of course, as billions of users have been trained to do exactly this: “react.”
What if there were a “trust emoji”? Or respect-based emojis? If a palette of six emoji-faced angry-love-sad-haha emotional buttons continues to be the way we engage with one another — and how we respond to the news — then it’s going to be an uphill battle.
Negative emotion, click bait and viral outrage are how the platform is “being used to divide.” Given this problem, Facebook needs to help us unite by building new sharing tools based on trust and respect.
 Kevin Kelly
 Co-founder of Wired magazine.
Facebook should reduce anonymity by requiring real verification of real names for real people, with the aim of having 100 percent of individuals verified.
Companies would need additional levels of verification, and should have a label and scrutiny different from those of people. (Whistle-blowers and dissidents might need to use a different platform.)
Facebook could also offer an optional filter that would keep any post (or share) of an unverified account from showing up. I’d use that filter.
 Ro Khanna
 Democrat representing California’s 17th Congressional District, which includes sections of Silicon Valley.
Ultimately, whether from tech companies or Congress, what people want is more transparency.
Facebook should expand on its Hard Questions blog to explain how its news feed algorithms work, how it uses data in targeting and how it makes decisions about third-party verification and removing offensive content. It should make it simple for users to provide feedback and be responsive to their concerns.
The company also should make its executives readily available to the press, and they should spend time on Capitol Hill to explain their decision-making.
Everyone understands that new technology platforms are not perfect, and that bad actors find ways to abuse them. The key is for Facebook to be upfront about technical challenges, open about its mistakes and willing to answer the tough questions honestly. If it does that, it will continue to earn the public’s trust.
 Kate Losse
 Early Facebook employee who recounted her time at the company in her book, “The Boy Kings: A Journey Into the Heart of the Social Network.”
It would be interesting if Facebook offered a “vintage Facebook” setting that users could toggle to, without News Feed ads and “like” buttons. (Before “likes,” users wrote comments, which made interactions more unique and memorable.)
A “vintage Facebook” setting not only would be less cluttered, it would refocus the experience of using Facebook on the people using it, and their intentions for communication and interaction.
Somehow, no matter how “smart” the Facebook algorithms and behind-the-scenes data processing get, the site felt more engaging as a tool for human communication when interaction was primarily driven by what users wanted to do and say, rather than where the algorithms want people to look.
 Alice Marwick
 Assistant professor of communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Facebook should allow users to sort their news feed chronologically by default on all platforms, rather than rely on an algorithmically sorted News Feed. This would increase the diversity of items in the News Feed, and would make it more likely that users were exposed to people and information that didn’t support their own confirmation bias.
It should also greatly increase the human oversight of ad targeting systems — specifically, oversee algorithmically generated categories (rather than basing them solely on user-inputted interests). Political and interest-based advertising should be under much stricter scrutiny than, say, the advertising of T-shirts or hair products.
 Ellen Pao
 Chief diversity and inclusion officer at the Kapor Center for Social Impact and a former chief executive of Reddit.
Facebook needs to replace its focus on engagement quantity with interaction quality. To really do that means replacing at least half of the leadership team and board with underrepresented people of color who are informed and value diversity and inclusion — and, as my colleague Freada Kapor Klein suggested, have journalistic principles. At Reddit, I was able to effect positive, lasting change (at least according to this research) to content quality and interaction quality by building a diverse executive team.
 Eli Pariser
 Chief executive of Upworthy and author of “The Filter Bubble.”
Facebook should open itself up for independent research. Right now, Facebook is a black box: It’s very difficult, and in many cases impossible, for researchers to independently look at behavior on the platform. While opening private data to research creates risks, there’s a ton of explicitly public data on the platform that Facebook makes difficult to query at scale. Facebook could also open up many of the tools advertisers currently use for free use by research scientists. It would be a bold move for transparency, and one that would help us understand much better what’s happening on the world’s most important social platform. And it’d be wise to do this before regulators forced them to.
The company should also optimize for “time well spent.” Facebook’s greatest superpower is figuring out how to eat as much of our attention as possible. But as Tristan Harris and others have pointed out, that attention often doesn’t yield much — leaving us poorly informed and feeling worse about ourselves. Instead of measuring clicks and likes, what if Facebook optimized for how much value an article or video or game gave us weeks or months afterward? The company could survey of the kinds of content we’ve spent the most time on, and ask us which gave us the most and least value, as a way to balance our impulsive present selves with our greater aspirations.
 Vivian Schiller
 Adviser and former news executive at NPR, NBC News and Twitter.
The single most important thing Facebook must do is come clean. Tell us what you know. Tell us what you know but can’t share. Tell us what you don’t know. And tell us what you don’t know that you don’t know. Stop hiding behind bromides like “we are not a media company.” That makes us think you don’t understand you have a serious set of problems that need fixing. Coming clean may not be the only thing, and may not be the main thing, but it’s the first thing.
 Tim Wu
 Professor at Columbia Law School and author of “The Attention Merchants: The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads.”
Facebook should become a public benefit corporation. These companies must aim to do something that would aid the public, and board members must also take that public benefit into account when making decisions. Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebook’s goals are “bringing us closer together” and “building a global community.” Worthy, beautiful goals, but easier said than done when Facebook is also stuck delivering ever-increasing profits and making its platform serve the needs of advertisers.
What if Facebook were actually free to do what it says it wants to? What if it didn’t need to devote so much energy to the evil sides of the business, whether catering to filter bubbles, addicting and manipulating users, seizing data, bending over backward for advertisers and destroying competitors? As a nonprofit or public benefit corporation (like Kickstarter), Facebook could be a much better institution. It could shed its “two masters” dilemma, truly pursue its lofty goals and become a firm of which its users and the world could actually be proud.

 Facebook is set for strong earnings with healthy advertising revenue growth and a stock set to pop another 22 percent over the next 12 months, according to one Wall Street analyst.
 Deutsche Bank told investors to watch for 42 percent year-over-year ad revenue growth and mentions of ""aggressive"" investment in video content in Facebook's earnings report Wednesday. The social media giant is expected to funnel additional funding into video content over the next year in an effort to capture unrecognized revenue.
""We see upside bias to revenue and earnings estimates for 3Q and beyond,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Lloyd Walmsley. ""Despite Facebook's caution of a second half 2017 slowdown due to ad impression growth, our conversations with advertisers throughout the quarter and at AdWeek suggested that strength in ad revenues should continue.""

 Here's how to trade Facebook going into earnings   
 4:21  PM ET Tue, 31 Oct 2017 |  04:15 
 Facebook is at record highs, and TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon says there's something in the charts that leads him to believe that the stock has more room to run.
 The tech giant is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, and Gordon is expecting Facebook to rally based on the company's previous reports.
What's more, the trader also says Facebook's charts are signaling that the stock has recently broken out of ""consolidation"" that began in August.
 ""That consolidation appears to be over and it looks like we are beginning to move higher,"" he said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""If we continue to follow this path post-earnings, we should be able to break up through and reach possibly $185, maybe even $190, on a strong earnings beat."" That's another 3 to 5 percent higher than where Facebook closed on Tuesday around $180.
 Since the market is expecting an $8 move in either direction on earnings for Facebook, Gordon wants to set up a ""call butterfly spread"" to not only go long Facebook, but to also make sure to protect himself against any big swings in the stock post-earnings. A call butterfly spread involves selling two calls at the same strike, and then buying one higher strike call and one lower strike call.
In this case, Gordon wants to sell two of the Nov. 3 weekly 185-strike calls, buy one of the Nov. 3 weekly 190-strike calls, and buy one of the Nov. 3 weekly 180-strike calls for a total of about 88 cents, or $88 for the whole spread.
With this trade, Gordon would make a maximum profit of about $414, which would occur if Facebook closed right at $185, the middle strike, on Nov. 3 expiration. Profits would trail off, however, the further Facebook closes away from $185 on Nov. 3 expiration, meaning that Gordon would see a maximum loss of $88 if Facebook were to close below $180 or above $190 on Friday.
""So basically, you're betting that the stock will move up, but in an expected range,"" he said. ""Whether the earnings are terrible or absolutely amazing, you have a fixed manageable loss.""
Facebook is up 56 percent year to date.

Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg
 Wall Street is expecting Facebook to show a revenue rise of 40 percent from a year ago, though profit is projected to rise more slowly as the company again hired more workers and invested in new technologies.
 Revenue is expected to climb to $9.84 billion for the period, from $7.01 billion a year earlier, based on the average estimate of Wall Street analysts who cover the stock.
Per-share earnings for the quarter are expected at $1.28, up from $1.09 a share for the same period in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.
 Facebook's ability to target digital ads at users based on their ""likes"" and other online behavior is effective enough that some in Congress want to regulate its ability to target political ads.
Yet even as Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch is getting grilled in front of committees in both chambers of Congress over the company's role in last year's election, stock buyers bid the company's shares to a record intraday high of $182.69 early Wednesday.
Stretch on Tuesday mentioned that Facebook expects to double the number of people working on security and community-related issues from 10,000 today to more than 20,000 by the end of next year. Those hires could raise expenses, although many will probably be contractors. Facebook has just more than 20,000 full-time employees.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg, COO Sheryl Sandberg and CFO David Wehner are expected to conduct a conference call with investors and analysts after the close of U.S. markets to discuss third-quarter results.

Senator Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, right, and ranking member Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, listen during a hearing on social media influence in the 2016 U.S. elections in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Wednesday, Nov. 1, 2017.
 Members of Congress blasted representatives from Facebook, Twitter and Google on Wednesday for what they said was their inadequate response to Russian mischief made on their platforms during the 2016 election.
 ""I don't think you get it,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told the companies' general counsels during the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. ""What we're talking about is a cataclysmic change. What we're talking about is the beginning of cyberwarfare.""
Facebook's Colin Stretch, Twitter's Sean Edgett and Google's Kent Walker revealed little new information about the extent of foreign influence on their platforms. 
 Representatives of the companies appeared before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Tuesday and were due to testify at a House Intelligence Committee hearing later Wednesday.
The companies appeared under-prepared to answer some of the questions on Wednesday. Stretch, Edgett and Walker produced statistics of Russia-linked advertisements and accounts, but questions about more general Russia propaganda on the platforms and socially divisive content drew only silences and promises to provide the information at a later date. 
Facebook said this week that Russian-backed election content on the platform reached 126 million Americans; Twitter found 36,000 Russian accounts were active during the election; and Google said  pro-Russian groups purchased $4,700 worth of ads on its platforms.
Senators repeatedly interrupted the general counsels' answers and moved on before allowing them to finish, clearly exasperated by the counsels' tendency to provide long-winded answers — and often by the answers themselves.
""It's not clear that you or the public understand the degree of this,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ""You need to stop paying lip service.""
Wyden asked the three whether they were satisfied with their platforms' monitoring of foreign influence during the 2016 presidential election — all three said no.
""This is not a Democrat or Republic issue. This is an American issue"", said Sen. Joe Manchin, D-WV. ""You cannot allow what's going on against the United States of America. You're on the front lines with us.""
Manchin said the companies' inaction threatened the security, safety and ""sovereignty of our nation."" 
The week's hearings could mark a turning point for the internet giants as discussions of regulation come to fore. Twitter and Facebook have each moved to increase transparency around advertising, after public comments by CEOs Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg.
Several senators indicated during Wednesday's hearing that legislation could be on the horizon for the tech companies, though they varied on the extent.
Manchin asked for the companies' reactions to the proposed Honest Ads Act, which would require greater information around political content . Only Twitter provided an answer, and it was mostly supportive. Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma said any legislation may have only the ""lightest touch.""

 Facebook beats on top and bottom lines   
 4:25  PM ET Wed,  1 Nov 2017 |  01:53 
 Facebook reported third-quarter profit and sales that topped Wall Street expectations, but its shares fell after it said on a conference call that 2018 expenses would rise 45 percent to 60 percent, or faster than expected sales.
 After trading as high as $185 a share soon after the results were released, the stock fell as much as 2 percent, to near $179, after the company issued its initial 2018 expense forecast.
Facebook shares have risen more than 50 percent this year.
 Here's the key data:
 EPS: $1.59 per share, more than the $1.28 a share expected. Revenue: $10.3 billion, up 47 percent and more than $9.84 billion expected MAUs: 2.07 billion versus 2.06 billion expected 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg warned that protecting the site from those wanting to spread fake news and hate speech will drive costs higher.
""We're serious about preventing abuse on our platforms. We're investing so much in security that it will impact our profitability,"" Zuckerberg said.
On a conference call to discuss the results, he added that protecting Facebook's community is ""more important"" than boosting profit.
The company said yesterday it would double to 20,000 the number of workers dedicated to keeping fake news and hate speech off its sites by the end of next year.
CFO David Wehner said on the same call that 2018 operating expenses will rise significantly as the company pays more for security and original content.
Capital expenditures will double next year, Wehner said.
 More than 6 million advertisers
 For the quarter ended Sept. 30, online marketers bought more Facebook ads to target messages at mobile internet users.
Facebook's ability to target digital ads at users based on their ""likes"" and other online behavior is so effective that some in Congress want to regulate its ability to sell political advertising.
Third-quarter ad sales rose 49 percent to $10.1 billion, while mobile sales rose to $8.9 billion, or 88 percent of all sales.
The average cost of an ad rose 35 percent, Wehner said, while total ad impressions were up 10 percent from a year ago.
Ad prices will have more impact on future ad revenue than the number of ads Facebook sells, Wehner told investors and analysts on the call.
Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said on the conference call that Facebook now has more than 6 million advertisers, while the company's Instagram service has more than 2 million.
Monthly average users rose 16 percent from a year ago, to 2.07 billion.
The company's operating margin, a key measure of profit, widened to 50 percent of revenue from 44 percent a year ago, even though head count rose 47 percent to 23,165.
Net income surged to $4.7 billion from $2.63 billion a year earlier.

Vladimir Putin
 Some of the ads posted to Facebook by Russia-affiliated groups ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election were recently published by the House Intelligence Committee.
The release follows a confirmation that about 150 million Americans may have been exposed to Russian content on Facebook and Instagram in the two years leading up to the 2016 election.
 Facebook, Google and Twitter have all been testifying before Congress this week as lawmakers try to discover how each company allowed Russian influence and whether there needs to be more regulation of tech companies.
 House Intelligence Committee
 The ads released by the House Intelligence Committee feature posts for anti-Hillary Clinton gatherings, support for Black Lives Matter, anti-Black Lives Matter messages and an ad that calls for Facebook users to disavow Hillary Clinton and to support Trump.
 House Intelligence Committee
 Alone, the ads don't appear to look much different from what you're probably used to seeing on Facebook. But the contradictory messages across them suggest the Russian government was trying to exacerbate political divisions in the U.S. population.

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Facebook Inc., speaks during an event in Menlo Park, California.
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg indicated that defending its 2 billion users from fake news, hate speech and other unwanted content may put a serious dent in the company's profit margins.
 ""I want to be clear about what our priority is,"" Zuckerberg said on Wednesday after the company reported third-quarter earnings. ""Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.""
CFO David Wehner later forecast that higher security costs, combined with investments in original video content, would drive up operating expenses between 45 percent and 60 percent in 2018. Sales, meanwhile, are expected to increase 30 percent next year to $51 billion, according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
 Facebook's stock price, which initially rose after revenue and profit topped estimates, dropped below Wednesday's close when the company revealed its spending plans. 
Facebook is under fire for its role in the 2016 election. During three separate congressional committees, executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google were asked about how their platforms were abused by Russian propagandists to influence American voter behavior.
""Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust,"" Zuckerberg said. ""We build these tools to help people connect and bring us closer together. And they used them to try to undermine our values. What they did is wrong and we're not going to stand for it.""

 Here's what Facebook's Russia problem means for the stock   
 6:13  PM ET Tue, 31 Oct 2017 |  05:36 
 Several lawmakers scolded the company this week for not being faster in removing fake news and divisive ads created by a Russian propaganda operation.
On Tuesday, Senator Al Franken of Minnesota hammered the company for its inability to spot political ads that were paid for in Russian currency.
""You had American political ads paid for in Rubles,"" Franken said. ""How could you not connect those dots?"" 
Zuckerberg said the company understands the problem but faces a steep challenge in solving it. He admitted that the company's artificial intelligence software isn't yet good enough to protect users from unwanted content.
""We need AI and people,"" he said.
Facebook said on Tuesday that it will double the number of people dedicated to safety and security to 20,000 by the end of next year. The company is also investing in engineering and technology expertise to improve its AI.
""We're building AI to go after more different areas of content,"" Zuckerberg said. ""Al will make the product better over the long term, but we'll incur expenses a lot sooner.""

Committee ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) speaks during a hearing before the House (Select) Intelligence Committee November 1, 2017 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.
 During a series of hearings before House and Senate committees this week, members of Congress trotted out poster boards showing graphic examples of social media advertisements that attempted to influence the 2016 election. With headlines like ""Heritage, not hate. The South will rise again!"" and ""Join us because we care. Black matters!"" these ads focused on polarizing, hot-button issues including gun ownership, race relations, immigration, and religion, simultaneously targeting both sides of each debate in an effort to foment unrest.
 Attorneys for Facebook, Google, and Twitter sat in the hot seat during these hearings and offered Congress assurances that they take the issue seriously and are implementing new controls to prevent misleading advertising. The issue with those safeguards, however, is that they are not likely to be effective. Many of them depend heavily upon artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies that simply aren't yet up to the challenge, at least on their own.
At the heart of these approaches is the belief that social media companies can develop models that automatically identify false and misleading advertisements, as well as advertisers operating under a false flag. The reality is that parties seeking to defeat these automated safeguards can continually alter their advertisements until they discover content that passes through the algorithm's filters.
 This doesn't mean, however, that artificial intelligence can't be a valuable tool in the fight against fake news. It just can't be our only tool. Effective approaches to combatting misleading advertisements must combine technology with old-fashioned human investigative skills. There are two key actions industry can take to protect the integrity of online advertising.
 ""Make no mistake about it. These mechanisms will be expensive, but they are necessary to preserving the integrity of online platforms as trusted forums.""
 First, companies should verify and disclose the identities of online advertisers. The American public has the right to know when they're viewing paid content and deserves to understand who is putting up the money to sponsor those messages. During Tuesday's hearings, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana addressed this issue bluntly: ""I don't believe that you have the ability to determine the identity of all of your advertisers,"" he told attorneys for Facebook, Google, and Twitter. ""You're good, but you're not that good."" Overcoming the skepticism of Senator Kennedy will require that social media firms roll up their sleeves and dig into records to confirm the identity of advertisers.
Second, the content of advertisements also requires careful scrutiny. Advertisements from new advertisers should be reviewed by a human trained to identify blatantly false and misleading advertisements - prior to their publication. This single control will prevent propaganda purveyors from simply creating new advertising accounts each time they are shut down.
Make no mistake about it. These mechanisms will be expensive, but they are necessary to preserving the integrity of online platforms as trusted forums. Recent estimates place the size of the online advertising market at $83 billion this year. Surely, there's some room in that budget for the staff required to screen advertisers and advertising content.
In fact, according to a  report in Wired magazine, Google has had a similar model in place since 2004. The company hires a virtual army of content screeners to view YouTube videos searching for offensive content. Their goal? To make sure that paid advertisements don't wind up running alongside offensive content, potentially tarnishing the reputation of their corporate customers. It's time to take this same approach to protect society from misleading and dangerous advertisements.
Social media companies find themselves at a crucial crossroads. They may choose to apply their considerable talent and wealth toward the goal of creating what Sean Edgett, attorney for Twitter, described to Congress as ""a safe, open, transparent, and positive platform."" Or they may decide that rigorous screening of potential customers is not a justifiable investment.
Will Google, Facebook, Twitter, and their counterparts take these steps? While it would be ideal, history tells us that self-regulation rarely works in the absence of government oversight. That's why we have the FTC, FDA, and other watchdog agencies. Social media platforms would be wise to heed the warning issued by Senator Dianne Feinstein during Wednesday's hearings: ""You have to be the ones to do something about it…or we will.""
Senator Feinstein is right. The American people are watching. Do the right thing.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook.
 Facebook's latest Snapchat competitor, a feature called WhatsApp Status, has 300 million monthly users less than a year after its launch, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts and investors this week. 
 The app has grown even faster than the Stories feature on Facebook's Instagram service, which Zuckerberg said also has 300 million monthly users, according to a transcript of the company's quarterly earnings call.
Instagram Stories, Facebook's first attack on Snapchat, was launched in August 2016, as Facebook began aggressively courting the same younger demographic of its upstart rival. By April 2017, it had already surpassed Snapchat's user count.
 This year, Snapchat has posted slower growth than Wall Street analysts were expecting when its parent company, Snap, first sold shares to the public in March.
Like Instagram Stories, the newer WhatsApp feature also lets users to post a status update that disappears after 24 hours. Users can also post a photo or video which has the same ephemeral quality pioneered by Snapchat.
The application, which has a bare-bones design uncluttered by ads, was launched in late February, according to a blog post by WhatsApp founder Jan Koum.
In the post, Koum touted the security of the feature. ""Share photos and videos with your friends and contacts on WhatsApp in an easy and secure way...even your status updates are end-to-end encrypted,"" Koum wrote.
Disclosure: CNBC's parent company is an investor in Snap.

 9:51  AM ET Thu,  2 Nov 2017 |  02:01 
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg did a ""masterful"" job discussing the impact of Russia's election meddling during the company's post-earnings conference call, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday.
 During the call Wednesday, the Facebook chief said the company plans to boost spending to police content, adding he is ""dead serious"" about preventing abuse on its platform.
That came after Facebook told lawmakers this week that Russia-based operatives published about 80,000 posts on the social network over a two-year period in an effort to sway U.S. politics.
 ""I've directed our teams to invest so much in security, on top of the other investments that we're making, that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward,"" Zuckerberg told investors during the call. ""And I wanted our investors to hear that directly from me.""
""I thought this was a masterful conference call,"" said Cramer, whose charitable trust owns shares of Facebook. ""Why? Because he is basically heading off any possibility that they'll be a billion dollar fine [or] Justice Department investigation.""
Protecting the Facebook community is more important than ""maximizing our profits,"" Zuckerberg said on the call.
""It's a brilliant narrative,"" Cramer said on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""Because what most people had been afraid of what that he was going to say he was going to boost security, but it would have no impact on earnings."" 
That would  ""make it absolutely chimerical,"" Cramer said. ""It would make it so it is just a show."" 
Facebook reported third-quarter profit and sales on Wednesday that beat Wall Street's expectations. The company said later on a conference call that 2018 expenses would rise 45 percent to 60 percent. The stock was down 2.1 percent midmorning Thursday.

 Facebook shares fall from record as Wall Street grows wary   
 12:26  PM ET Thu,  2 Nov 2017 |  01:23 
 Wall Street largely gushed over Facebook's comfortable earnings beat, but analysts are keeping a wary eye on the social network's costs for security and content.
 Shares of Facebook fell 2 percent in early trading Thursday, despite its much better-than-expected results Wednesday. The stock closed at a record Wednesday, up 59 percent for the year.
Analysts fear the controversy over how Russia surreptitiously used Facebook during the 2016 election is not just bad PR but may hit the social media titan's impeccable bottom line as the company invests further in security to take itself out of the political crosshairs.
 ""With the backdrop of Facebook, Google, and Twitter in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, and generally increasing discussion of regulatory scrutiny of mega-cap tech, Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg in particular placed heavy emphasis on security and the integrity of the Facebook platform"" during the company's post-earnings conference call, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note to clients Thursday. ""Importantly, Facebook will increase the number of people working on safety & security (both FTEs & contractors) from ~10k now to 20k over the next year.""
While Anmuth felt that the company's efforts to curb fake news and hate speech on its platform would ultimately serve Facebook well, many analysts are concerned that increases in short-term spending may put pressure on attractive margins.
Facebook, Google and Twitter representatives have been testifying before Congress this week as lawmakers try to discover how each company allowed stealth Russian posts and whether there needs to be more regulation of tech companies. And while each company has voiced interest in dealing with interference in social media internally, the possibility of regulation also weighs on investor sentiment.
""Facebook's efforts will come in many forms — increasing transparency of political and issue ads, removing problematic content such as false news and hate speech and bulking up review of ad content,"" added Anmuth.
Anmuth wasn't the only analyst to comment on the company's plans.
""The changes are particularly aimed at curbing misuse of the platform similar to what the Russian government perpetrated during the U.S. 2016 election,"" Macquarie's Benjamin Schachter said in a note to clients. ""Facebook plans to raise the standards of transparency for political ads on the site, rolling out a tool to let users see all of the ads a page is currently running, and also an archive of political ads the advertiser has run in the past.""
Zuckerberg's company indicated that operating expenditures will increase 45 to 60 percent as the company funnels more cash into security, video content, augmented reality and artificial intelligence.
""We're building, we're doubling — in some cases more — our engineering teams focused on security,"" Zuckerberg said Wednesday. ""We're building AI to go after more different areas of harmful content and finding fake accounts and other bad actors in the system. And I expect that all of these things will make our product better over the long term, but we will incur the expenses a lot sooner as we ramp up these efforts.""
To be sure, Facebook's performance so far this year is nothing to complain about.
The company posted FX-neutral advertising revenue growth of 47 percent year over year thanks to ad pricing ramp, a ""rare and impressive"" feat according to Anmuth. Overseas growth in monthly active users — a key metric for Facebook — also looks promising to many analysts.
Shares have soared 59 percent this year, easily outpacing the S&P 500's impressive 15 percent climb since January.
""FB remains our top large cap internet pick and we think that momentum in the name can continue through the end of the year,"" wrote Jefferies analyst Brent Thill. ""We see upside to average revenue per user, monthly active users, and Instagram.""
Several analysts highlighted photo-sharing app Instagram as a potential catalyst 
 for Facebook and an area for increasing ad load.

 Two Democratic senators recently created a fictitious Facebook group to prove just how easy it is to target specific people with fake news.
 Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota built a group on Facebook and named it ""Americans for Disclosure Solutions"" which has the acronym ADS. The senators then paid Facebook to show ads to journalists and staffers on the Hill. The news was first reported by Axios.
According to data provided to CNBC by Senator Warner's office, $20 was enough to reach 1,369 Hill staffers in under 24 hours. An additional $20 allowed the fake Facebook group to target 1,407 Washington, D.C.-based journalists, a spokesperson for the Senator's office explained.
 ""That's a pretty good ROI – you can see why this would be so appealing to the Russians, and anybody else who is trying to target Americans in order to sow division and discord,"" a spokesperson in Senator Warner's office told CNBC. ""There are no existing policies in place to prevent running nefarious ads on Facebook. Despite registering ADS on Facebook as a ""Political Organization,"" we were able to run an ad campaign without providing basic information necessary to ensure compliance with federal, state or local election laws, such as campaign contact information, candidate ID, etc.""
""Online political advertising represents an enormous marketplace, and today there is almost no transparency. The Russians realized this, and took advantage in 2016 to spread disinformation and misinformation in an organized effort to divide and distract us,"" Senator Warner said. ""Our bipartisan Honest Ads Act extends transparency and disclosure to political ads in the digital space. At the end of the day, it is not too much to ask that our most innovative digital companies work with us by exercising additional judgment and providing some transparency."" 
The Senators were making a point: They could easily create a group and spread any narrative without having to prove who they were or what they stood for. This is what Russian-linked operatives were allegedly doing ahead of and during the U.S. presidential campaign, and why Facebook, Google and Twitter representatives testified on Capitol Hill this week. The  House Intelligence Committee recently published several of the ads that Russian-controlled groups were posting.
Facebook was not immediately available for comment.

 Facebook & Tesla good long-term investments   
 7:15  PM ET Thu,  2 Nov 2017 |  01:04 
 After negative reactions to Facebook's and Tesla's respective earnings reports on Wall Street, CNBC's Jim Cramer made a somewhat contrarian call.
 ""You know what? I think the stocks of these two companies could reverse and go higher after a couple of days of selling,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""It has to do with the way they handle their conference calls after they report their earnings, and how they approach their investor bases and make their promises.""
Cramer began with Tesla. The automaker posted a larger-than-expected loss in the third quarter due to production problems with its Model 3 sedan.
 Elon Musk, Tesla's outspoken CEO, tried to mitigate analysts' concerns on the conference call, acknowledging the production issues but saying that, once they're fixed, Tesla could become a production machine with the highest profitability in the industry.
The Street responded in kind, sending shares of Tesla down nearly 10 percent on Wednesday. But individual investors could respond differently, Cramer said.
""There's a retail investor cohort who actually cares about different things,"" Cramer said. ""You gotta have faith, and individual investors, they've got just that when it comes to the stock of Tesla. They believe in Tesla, which is why they'll soon come in to buy the stock because they love the car and they don't care about things like profit or gross margins or earnings per share.""
Musk's followers tend to forgive his over-promising and under-delivering, even if the analysts who cover Tesla don't. Cramer said that he could see Tesla's stock withstanding another round of financing on the faith of its fans.
Facebook's third-quarter earnings report beat analyst estimates, but the company's situation is different, Cramer said.
The social media giant's management tends to under-promise on conference calls, like in 2016 when they said they expected Facebook's ad revenue growth rate to ""come down meaningfully.""
After this quarter, shares of Facebook fell on the company's statements that countering bad actors like Russian hackers on its platform will significantly impact profitability.
""Facebook's stock was up 4 [basis] points before [CEO Mark] Zuckerberg said that and added, 'protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,'"" Cramer said. ""I think this comment's just like the ad slowdown comment. It's done to temper expectations as well as make it clear to Congress that Facebook's good actors.""
So, even as neither conference call inspired much near-term confidence, Cramer pointed to the statistics: Tesla's stock is up 50 percent for 2017 and Facebook's stock is up 58 percent.
""They both have their narratives, one hopelessly upbeat, the other ridiculously downbeat, and both work longer term even with the short-term pressure they're under,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Two different strategies, same stock results a few weeks later, as the stocks first go lower and then climb right back up again.""

79,2017-11-03,"Facebook, Google, Microsoft, SpaceX to Trump: US will lose $460.3 billion if we end 'dreamer' protection  Here's how Snap sizes up to Facebook & Twitter  ","The future of ""Dreamers,"" children who arrived in the United States illegally, is pitting President Donald Trump against big tech.
 And this week, big tech upped its opposition to Trump's effort to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program by filing an amicus brief, or a legal statement of support, in California on Wednesday.
The amicus brief breaks down how damaging it would be to U.S. companies, workers and the economy for DACA to be repealed. The lawsuit says if DACA is rescinded, the U.S. economy would lose $460.3 billion over the next ten years. Contributions to Social Security and Medicare would be reduced by $24.6 billion in the same time frame, the lawsuit says.
 In September, Trump decided to rescind DACA, which President Obama had established in 2012. Trump said he would allow the program to expire in March. Trump claimed Obama overreached his legislative authority to set up DACA, but the lawsuit big tech is supporting refutes this claim.
""DACA closely resembles deferred action programs adopted in the past, and complies fully with the applicable statute. The agency's rescission of DACA, predicated entirely on that erroneous legal conclusion, therefore cannot stand,"" the lawsuit says.

 Zuckerberg says it's a 'sad day' as tech execs slam Trump for ending DACA   
 2:38  PM ET Tue,  5 Sept 2017 |  01:03 
 The amicus brief included signatories of 108 tech firms including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Tesla, SpaceX, Uber, Twitter, Verizon, Lyft, eBay, and the list goes on.
 DACA gives ""Dreamers"" the ability to work in the U.S. legally. The $460 billion hit to the U.S. economy if DACA is rescinded is because 700,000 ""dreamers,"" who are currently employed, would lose their jobs in the next two years. That's equivalent to 1,400 dreamers losing their job every day, the lawsuit says.
""Dreamers"" currently work at 72 percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies including IBM, Walmart, Apple, General Motors, Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Home Depot and Wells Fargo, the lawsuit says. Replacing those ""Dreamers"" put out of work will cost U.S. companies $6.3 billion.
The lawsuit disputes the claim that ""Dreamers"" are taking jobs that would otherwise go to Americans, instead positing ""Dreamers"" are often taking jobs that companies struggle to fill with qualified workers.
""The jobs being filled by Dreamers post-DACA are largely jobs for which there is a shortage of qualified workers—not the jobs that are or could be filled by U.S.-born workers,"" the lawsuit says. Indeed, since 2012, when Obama established DACA, the unemployment rate has fallen by almost half, the lawsuit says.
In September, when Trump announced his decision to rescind DACA initially, there was an outpouring of support from tech CEOs and leaders.""This is a sad day for our country. The decision to end DACA is not just wrong. It is particularly cruel to offer young people the American Dream, encourage them to come out of the shadows and trust our government, and then punish them for it,"" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a public Facebook post.
Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in a tweet, ""Dreamers are our neighbors, our friends and our co-workers. This is their home.""

 Facebook is trying to show that it's serious about snagging business users, and Dreamforce is the place to do it. 
 On Tuesday, the company talked up its Workplace by Facebook offering at Salesforce's annual software conference in San Francisco. While Facebook's core business is ads that target consumers, the company doesn't want to cede the work market to Slack, Microsoft and HipChat from Atlassian.
Facebook said in a blog post that it's teaming up with Salesforce to improve its Workplace service, which is a version of the social network that's designed for use by working teams. The partnership, first announced in April, is designed to bring Salesforce's enterprise software tools into Facebook. 
 In particular, Facebook is focused on making collaboration smoother by integrating Salesforce's Quip word processing and spreadsheet tools. There will be buttons for uploading documents to Quip as well as creating new documents, along with a list of all available files.

Bret Taylor, co-founder and chief executive officer of Quip.
 ""These improvements will make it easier for teams collaborate, edit, and work together on documents,"" Facebook wrote in the blog post. ""So they can work faster and get more done."" 
Workplace by Facebook also has integrations with Box, Dropbox, Google's G Suite and Microsoft's Office and OneDrive. 
Facebook introduced the app in 2015 and said last month that 30,000 organizations, including Walmart, are using it.
Working with Salesforce on Quip is a natural move for Facebook. Bret Taylor, the CEO of Quip, which Salesforce acquired last year, was previously Facebook's chief technology officer.

Co-Founder and CEO of Snap Inc. Evan Spiegel.
 Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said on Tuesday during an earnings call that Snapchat plans to redesign its application to create the next version of the social media feed.
 There's no timing on the Snapchat redesign, Spiegel added. He hinted it would be the evolution of the social media feed, focused on friends and what people are watching currently. Twitter and Facebook were cited as inspirations. Spiegel said there will be ways to monetize the new feed, but did not provide any additional details.
The company is tweaking its app to attract new users who find it difficult to use. That likely includes older people who find the interface baffling — which might be one reason why Snapchat reported lower-than-expected daily active users (DAUs) of 178 million people in its third-quarter earnings report. Wall Street was expecting 181.2 million.
 ""One thing that we have heard over the years is that Snapchat is difficult to understand or hard to use, and our team has been working on responding to this feedback. As a result, we are currently redesigning our application to make it easier to use,"" Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in a prepared earnings statement Tuesday.
That's true. In fact, Snapchat had a guide with more than a dozen drawings on how to use the platform in its S-1 filing. 
Shares of Snapchat plunged after hours after its earnings missed on the top and bottom.

 Monday's jolting news broken by CNBC's David Faber that Disney had held discussions with 21st Century Fox about buying up many of Fox's most interesting cable and movie assets is still reverberating around the media world.
Laura Martin of Needham said on CNBC after the news broke that the deal is a ""dream come true"" for Disney. And she's right. If it happens, Disney would getthe valuable TV and film production business and IP (including Avatar, X Men and Ice Age), the FX and Nat Geo cable channels, very interesting international assets, and likely Fox's stake in Vice Media. All of these assets -- as well as FX executive John Landgraf -- would be extremely helpful to Disney in filling out content for its over-the-top digital entertainment offering planned for 2019.
 The report also says Disney is seeking to get Fox's stake in Hulu. To me, this is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the possible deal from a Disney perspective. It also hasn't gotten much attention yet.
 The forgotten player in over-the-top video
 Disney is already a 30% owner of Hulu. If it got Fox's 30% stake, it would move to a 60% control owner, along with Comcast at 30% and Time Warner at 10%.
Such a move would allow Disney to consolidate Hulu's financial results.
Hulu hasn't gotten nearly as much attention as Netflix over the past few years. The critical acclaim and Emmys for The Handmaid's Tale put it in the spotlight in recent months, but it's still not discussed on the same level as Amazon's Prime Video, Netflix, Apple and other potential over-the-top (OTT) video entrants. 
Why not?
Hulu is  expected to reach 32 million viewers later this year. That's less than Netflix's 128 million and Amazon's 85 million, but it is still formidable and ahead of everyone else who wants to launch an OTT network.
Consider this: Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley  recently predicted that Disney's planned entertainment OTT service, set to launch in 2019, could achieve 30 million subs by 2028.
Hulu's at that level today.
Hulu was founded in March 2007. Achieving scale takes time. Everyone who thinks it's a great idea to launch an OTT channel today might have a tough 10 years ahead of them.
How many ""must have"" OTT channels will each of us subscribe to in the future? Netflix, Apple (whenever they launch something), Amazon, Hulu and Disney all seem like likely choices. How many others?
Look at the app economy for comparison. On the top of the App Store charts today, it's basically Facebook (with Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp), Google and Snapchat. It seems like there also be a finite choice of OTT channels as well.
Becoming a majority owner of Hulu today might end up like being the majority owner of Instagram in 2014.
 A simpler corporate structure
 There's another attractive reason for Disney to want to gain majority control of Hulu. As I argued in June here, Hulu would likely grow faster with a simpler corporate structure and a majority owner. For example, the clear leadership could help them push Hulu much more aggressively internationally, as well as streamline content decisions.
It would also help to clear up the identity of Hulu versus a yet-to-launch Disney Entertainment OTT channel. Hulu could skew more adult with Handmaid's Tale, Family Guy, Simpsons, Fox films and FX-type content (under John Landgraf perhaps). Disney could keep Lucasfilm, Pixar, Marvel, and other Disney Channel type content.
Also, as Hulu would still be partly owned by Comcast and Time Warner, it could continue to shine a spotlight on other interesting content beyond Disney.
Hulu doesn't have to catch Netflix to be a success. If it stays in the Top 5 of OTT channels in the future, the way Instagram has stayed in the Top 5 on the App Store since Facebook bought it, it would be a home run for Disney.

Brad Parscale, digital director for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, speaks at Trump Tower in New York, Dec. 3, 2016.
 The digital director of Donald Trump's presidential election campaign has revealed how he helped get the businessman elected.
 Brad Parscale, a man who's been described as ""the genius who won Trump's campaign,"" by The Washington Post, said that Facebook had helped spread Trump's message to voters.
Speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, Portugal, on Wednesday, Parscale said that his background in advertising and marketing helped him see that Trump was a ""great product"" who was easy to promote to the American public.
 ""I think I had come from a consumer world for a long time and America and eyeballs were moving to social media in huge numbers, especially on mobile phones and devices. And when Donald Trump asked me to work on the campaign I also knew I had a great piece of product that would resonate with Americans,"" he said.
""You want a great product, you want things that resonate with people and make them dance.""
The election of Trump to the U.S. presidency a year ago was largely credited to an internet campaign led by Parscale that utilized social media platforms such as Facebook to spread his political views, a strategy first employed with success by his predecessor Barack Obama.
In October, Parscale credited Facebook with helping to fuel Trump's win last November, saying during an interview with CBS News that the Trump campaign had Facebook employees ""embedded inside our offices"" to explain how to use the platform to target voters. Facebook said in a statement that it had offered both the Trump and Clinton campaigns ""identical support.""
 How Facebook helped
 Parscale said Wednesday that the Facebook campaign had enabled Trump to ""raise a lot of money"" from grassroots supporters — up to $280 million, he said. But, in turn, a lot of money had been spent on advertising on the social media platform, allowing the Trump campaign to compete with Hillary Clinton's Democratic campaign.
""When Donald Trump became the (Republican) candidate we didn't have any money other than Mr Trump's money and I don't think he wanted to write that check all himself… We needed to create a grassroots campaign and we needed to go out and find millions of people to be our supporters and Facebook allowed us to do that in alarming numbers, very fast,"" Parscale said.

 4:45  PM ET Mon,  9 Oct 2017 |  00:49 
 He said social media platforms queued up to help the Trump campaign, wanting a share of its advertising spending: ""If you're going to spend $100 million on social media, a lot of people show up at your office wanting to help you spend that money on their platforms, so Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Google — they were all wanting to have that money.""
Facebook had helped to provide advice on how best to use its platform to engage with a wider audience, Parscale said: ""They have lots of products, they're a very big company and said, 'Please educate me and my staff in everything that you can,'"" something he claimed the Hillary Clinton campaign had not taken advantage of.
Parscale's interview at the Web Summit came a day after the Republican party was dealt a blow Tuesday, when Democrat Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam won the race for governor of Virginia, defeating Republican Ed Gillespie. Parscale responded to the Democrat victory by saying there were ""always ebbs and flows"" in politics and that he thought ""the Republican Party is in a great place for 2018 and I think Americans will continue to support the Trump agenda.""
Asked whether Trump had let down voters by not following through on some of his promises, such as a pledge to fix infrastructure in the U.S., Parscale said Trump had ""three more years to fix infrastructure"" and that he wasn't disappointed in his presidency so far.
""I think he's done a ton, I think he's done more than any other U.S. president we've had in a long time. Right now he's focused on tax reform and that's a thing to put more money in the pockets of middle-class Americans and that's what they want,"" he said.

 Facebook's latest attempt to wipe revenge porn off its platform: asking users to send their own nude photos.
The  Australian government's Office of the eSafety Commissioner announced it is joining a pilot program with Facebook to prevent intimate images of users from appearing against their will on the social network's platform.
The unusual catch: users worried an inappropriate image might appear on Facebook's platforms are asked to send an intimate image via Messenger, a preventive measure designed to flag the images before they're shared.
 Facebook did not respond to requests for comment.
According to the eSafety Office, if a Facebook user in Australia is concerned about an intimate image spreading online, they fill out a form, then send the image to themselves using Messenger.
Once Facebook is notified, they use image-matching technology to prevent anyone from sharing it on their platforms.
""This partnership gives Australians a unique opportunity to proactively inoculate themselves from future image-based abuse by coming to our portal and reporting tool,"" said Julie Inman Grant, Australia's eSafety Commissioner, in a statement.
The limited pilot program is available in three other countries: the U.S., U.K., and Canada.

In April, Facebook detailed plans to fight revenge porn, including an artificial intelligence tool capable of matching photos to prevent them from appearing on platforms like Messenger or Instagram.
""These tools, developed in partnership with global safety experts, are one example of how we're using new technology to keep people safe and prevent harm,"" said Antigone Davis, Facebook's head of global safety, in a statement.
According to Australia's eSafety office, 1 in 5 Australians has faced image-based abuse, where an intimate photo has been posted to social media without their consent.
""This pilot has the potential to disable the control and power perpetrators hold over victims, particularly in cases of ex-partner retribution and sextortion, and the subsequent harm that could come to them,"" said Inman Grant.
Two years ago, Twitter and Reddit cracked down on revenge porn,  banning the practice on both platforms.

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Facebook Inc., speaks during an event in Menlo Park, California.
 It's not just political advertising bought by Russians that has U.S. internet companies in hot water in Washington.
 Congress has asked Alphabet unit Google, Facebook and Twitter for information on any Russian-bought ads that either attempted to manipulate U.S. energy markets or criticized fossil fuel production here, according to a new report.
Republican Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman of the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, said officials at the technology firms have said in phone calls that they will provide the information ""soon,"" Bloomberg reported.
 Smith sent letters to the companies' CEOs on Sept. 27, seeking documents or communication related to those issues or other social media content on their sites ""advocating for so-called green energy initiatives.""
Read the full report here.
Emails sent to the companies seeking comment on Smith's statement weren't immediately returned.
Last week, officials from all three companies were grilled by House and Senate committees over ads used by a Russian propaganda unit to influence last year's U.S. election.

Sean Parker speaking at the 2015 CGI Annual Meeting in New York.
 A co-founder of Facebook bashed the company during an interview, saying that the social network was built to exploit vulnerabilities in human psychology.
 Sean Parker, founding president of the company, told Axios in an interview Wednesday that the premise of the social media site — a ""social-validation feedback loop"" — is ""exactly the kind of thing that a hacker like myself would come up with."" 
A like or a comment on a post sends users ""a little dopamine hit,"" he said, encouraging them to post again. 
 ""The inventors, creators — it's me, it's Mark [Zuckerberg], it's Kevin Systrom on Instagram, it's all of these people — understood this consciously. And we did it anyway,"" he said, according to a transcript of the interview. 
Parker said he would tell early holdouts to the platform that ""we'll get you eventually."" 
""I don't know if I really understood the consequences of what I was saying, because [of] the unintended consequences of a network when it grows to a billion or 2 billion people and ... it literally changes your relationship with society, with each other,"" Parker said. ""It probably interferes with productivity in weird ways. God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains.""
Parker left his post as president of Facebook in 2006 after less than two years but remains chairman of a Facebook segment dedicated to awareness and social causes, according to his LinkedIn account.

 Facebook and Micron are among the favorite ways to play the boom in artificial intelligence, according to top technology analysts. 
 The analysts were identified by looking at the average return of their recommendations and their success rate in those calls, as tracked by TipRanks, a Wall Street analyst database.
Here are five favorite AI stocks recommended by the best-performing technology analysts.
 1) Microsoft (MSFT)
In 2017, Microsoft changed its strategy from a ""mobile-first and cloud-first world"" to ""an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with AI."" And this strategy shift seems to be paying off. The company is now one of the leaders in AI, and has just teamed up withl Amazon to offer developers new tools to develop and share open source AI software.
In the last three months, 13 top analysts have published buy ratings on Microsoft shares, versus just one hold rating.
One bullish analyst is Oppenheimer's Timothy Horan. Following strong earnings results for the quarter, he assigned a buy rating to Microsoft on October 26. He also raised his price target to $92, from $80.
""Microsoft is focused on embedding all products and services with AI capabilities. Microsoft has proven it can execute on its hybrid cloud strategy, and we expect accelerating growth on both the top and bottom lines,"" says Horan. The analyst has a proven track record on Microsoft with a 100 percent success rate and 25 percent average return across his 11 Microsoft ratings.
2) Yext (YEXT)
Yext is a fast-growing tech company that makes it possible for restaurants, banks, doctors, and other businesses to centrally control online data in near real time. On November 5, KeyBanc analyst Brent Bracelin assigned a buy rating to Yext with a $16 price target. Given that the stock is currently trading at just $12, this suggests upside of 33 percent for the next 12 months.
Voice search and AI are underappreciated positive factors ""that could sustain high revenue growth for Yext in excess of 30 percent for an extended period of time, in our view,"" the analyst said.
Overall, this 'Strong Buy' stock has received three recent buy ratings from top-ranked analysts. With shares down 20 percent, the risk/ reward appears increasingly compelling say analysts. TipRanks shows that the average analyst price target of $17 suggests potential gains of over 40 percent from the current share price.
3) Facebook (FB)
Social media giant Facebook says it ""wants to solve AI."" The company boasts an impressive AI research team led by deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun and has listed AI as one of its major initiatives for 2018.
In the last three months, FB has received 29 buy ratings from analysts and only two bearish ratings. The average price target from these analysts is $207, which suggests big upside potential of 15 percent from the current price.

 3:39  PM ET Mon,  6 Nov 2017 |  00:42 
 Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena reiterated his buy rating with a $215 price target on November 2. ""FB has the largest audience platform in the world at a time when the advancement in deep neural network science, or artificial intelligence, is setting up for a very different computing era,"" he said.
Facebook is already helping Intel develop its long-awaited computer chips to power AI projects. Intel says the chip will be the first in the world specific to neural networks. 
4) Micron (MU)
Micron is one of the world's three biggest memory companies (Samsung and SK Hynix being the other two). Together these three companies control over 80 percent of the $122 billion global memory chip market at a time of worldwide memory shortage.
The stock has 22 buy ratings and only 2 hold ratings in the last three months. Meanwhile, even with shares exploding by 100 percent year to date, the average analyst price target of $52 suggests MU still has upside potential.
""We believe this global memory chip shortage is set to continue until the end of 2018, at the least"" writes Cyrus Mewawalla the managing director of CM Research. He says demand for DRAM chips and NAND flash chips comes from ""new and powerful technology cycles"" such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality.
For example, MU chips are used to power self-driving vehicles and help the car's systems detect hazards on the road. Specifically, Micron says it is already shipping its fastest LPDDR4x memory to ""multiple automotive customers,"" enabling system bandwidth speeds of 100 GB per second.
5) Alphabet Inc (GOOGL)
Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai claims Google has an ""AI first"" future. In the company's most-recent post-earnings call he told analysts: ""It's been particularly exciting to see our early bet on artificial intelligence pay off and go from a research project to something that can solve new problems for a billion people a day.""
Indeed, the company is the most active acquirer of AI, according to research firm CB Insights. In 2017 alone, Alphabet has picked up predictive analytics platform Kaggle, Bangalore based Halli Labs and the computer vision specialist startup AIMatter.
Google is using its AI technology to make existing products like email and search smarter. It is also releasing a constant stream of AI products including Google Lens (a camera that can recognize what it sees), smart speakers and wireless headphones that incorporate Google Assistant.
In the last three months, Alphabet has received 24 buy ratings and just 3 hold ratings from top analysts. The average analyst price target on Alphabet of $1,159 is 11 percent higher than the current share price.

 Roger McNamee: Facebook and Alphabet have behaved irresponsibly   
 11:54  AM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 |  05:08 
 An early Facebook and Google investor said Tuesday that revelations of Russian propaganda during the election have elevated his concerns about the personal data collected by the tech giants. 
 About 150 million Americans came in contact with divisive content or advertisements from bogus Russian-based accounts, according to Facebook. Russian state actors are also suspected of trying to influence the election through platforms like Google and Twitter.
""Those people have all been Zucked. They've all had their brains altered, and they've come to believe things that weren't true. And I want Facebook to contact every one of them,"" Roger McNamee said, referencing Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.
 Mark Neuling | CNBC
Roger McNamee
 ""I don't know if I would have seen it if it hadn't been for the Russian thing,"" McNamee told CNBC's ""Squawk Alley."" ""It was only because weird things were going on in the election that I even noticed something was weird."" 
McNamee said Facebook should contact each person who came in contact with any ""baloney"" Russian propaganda on the social media site. He also said it's important that Congress ask the CEOs to come in and discuss any Russian election interference in public.
""The thing that's so different about Facebook and Google is they have personal data on every adult and most young people,"" McNamee said. ""They are going straight into the brain of 2 billion people, and we don't have evolutionary defenses for that.""
McNamee is a managing director at investment firm Elevation Partners, which invested in companies like Yelp, Palm and Facebook. Former Apple executive Fred Anderson and musician Bono also help lead the group.
McNamee's comments came after Sean Parker — an early Facebook executive — said the site was built to exploit human vulnerability. McNamee pointed to other examples, like Google's YouTube Kids, that hook relatively ""defenseless"" consumers.
""To me, the notion that the original president of Facebook is ... admitting that they thought about addiction as the basis of a business model is a big change. It's one thing for me to say it, it's quite another for Sean Parker to say it,"" McNamee said.
Facebook has said it is doubling its staff that's focused on sensitive security and community issues to 20,000 by the end of next year, an investment that will impact its profits. 
Facebook and Google were not immediately available to comment on McNamee's remarks.
""They didn't [build their platform] because they wanted to blow up democracy. I don't think anyone thought they would be as successful a company as they are,"" McNamee said. ""The reality is, though, they have been that successful.""
But McNamee said demands from consumers would be more powerful than just trying to undermine Facebook's profits. He said consumers should push to own their own data and that technology companies should clarify how much of consumers' data they can really view.
""Did you sign up at the beginning to have them use your information for the rest of your life? To sell it to people for uses other than Facebook?"" McNamee asked. ""And for them to look for pictures of you everywhere they can find them and identify everything you're doing? Did you actually sign up for that? Do you even know — does any of us know —  what's in the user agreement?""

 Facebook is full of illegal ads for opioids   
 7:51  PM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 |  00:52 
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said the scope of the opioid crisis was what surprised him most during his 2017 travels throughout the country.
 But all he had to do was look at Facebook to see how pervasive the marketing is for these powerful and addictive pain medications.
Sellers here and overseas are using Facebook pages and videos to offer drugs that U.S. laws say require a prescription, CNBC has found.
 Searching on Facebook for the names of some of the most commonly prescribed pain medications pointed to multiple vendors selling Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Percocet and other similar drugs.
This illicit marketing persists three months after NBC News highlighted the problem, and weeks after President Donald Trump declared opioid addiction a public health emergency.

 Experts weigh in on whether Facebook ads should face regulation   
 3:32  PM ET Mon, 18 Sept 2017 |  02:42 
 The following screen shots show how sellers are using both Facebook videos and text posts to market these drugs illegally.
This content is not hard to find as long as you know what you're looking for.
For example, if you type in the name of various opiates followed by the phrase ""for sell,"" you can find information that won't be revealed by typing in ""for sale"" instead.
Here's a post we found on November 13 with a Facebook search for ""roxycodone,hydrocodone,oxycodone pills for sell.""
 These posts can evade detection on Facebook for months. For example, we conducted a search on November 13 for ""Oxycodone 30 mg for sell."" The results included a Facebook post dated Sept. 9, which was still online.
 When CNBC notified Facebook of these posts, the company said it would remove them. However, 12 hours later many similar posts were still available. The company told CNBC:
 Anyone can report content to us if they think it violates our standards. People can flag Pages, profiles, individual content, and/or comments to us for review. Upon receiving these reports, our Community Operations team, which is global and reviews content 24/7 in over 40 different languages, reviews reports against our Community Standards to determine if they violate. We remove violating content as soon as we become aware of it. In this case, a number of the Pages that turn up based on the search terms you provided were in violation of our policies. They have been removed from the platform. 
This statement suggests that Facebook is currently relying on users to police the site for illegal drug sales, rather than devoting employees to this task. Facebook did not immediately respond to a question whether it has specific employees to look for illegal drug listings on its site.
However, Facebook said on its last earnings call it will hire up to 20,000 people in 2018 for ""safety and security,"" including policing the site for fake news and other prohibited content. 
Facebook is not alone in providing unwitting marketing space for opioids. For example, a similarly simple search found videos advertising opioids on YouTube, a unit of Facebook-rival Alphabet.
For instance, this video selling Oxycodone was uploaded to YouTube six months ago and still showed up on Nov. 13.
 It was just one of several opiate marketing videos found by typing in search phrases like ""oxycodone for sell"" or ""fentanyl for sell.""
 A YouTube spokesperson told CNBC:
 YouTube's Community Guidelines prohibit any content encouraging dangerous or illegal activities, this includes content promoting the sale of drugs. We routinely remove videos and comments flagged by our community that violate those policies and in many cases we terminate the accounts of users who violate our Guidelines. 
Several hours after CNBC sent YouTube the first video listed above, it still appeared on the site. And, in a fitting bit of irony, the YouTube search algorithm was so good that after this reporter typed in dozens of different strings in the course of researching this story, the search box started suggesting different pill doses and vendors selling similar drugs.
In both cases, it appears these companies are playing a game of ""whack a mole"" when it comes to illegal drug marketing, taking content down after discovering it, rather than effectively stopping that content from being posted in the first place.  
The inability of these giant Internet companies to keep illegal drug sellers off their sites shows that it's not just fake news, hate speech, violent videos and foreign political propaganda that are overwhelming their content-filtering systems.

George Soros speaking at the 2015 CGI Annual Meeting in New York.
 George Soros' investment fund dumped its stock holdings in Apple and Snap in the last quarter while reducing stakes in other major tech giants including Facebook and Twitter, regulatory filings show.
 The billionaire investor's hedge fund, Soros Fund Management, sold 1,700 shares of Apple, and 1.55 million of Snap stock in the September quarter. This wiped out the hedge fund's stake in both companies, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings released Tuesday revealed.
It's important to note that the fund's holdings in Apple were relatively small, worth just $291,278 at Tuesday's market close. 
 However the Snap holding is significant. The 1.55 million shares were worth $19.48 million at Tuesday's close. 
There is a lot of bearishness around Snap, which has continued to miss earnings expectations and failed to grow its user base significantly. Snap shares are down over 48 percent since it went public in March. Wall Street analysts are also not sold on Snap. The stock has 19 ""hold"" ratings, nine ""sell,"" and one ""strong sell,"" according to Reuters data. 
Soros Fund Management also reduced its stake in Twitter by 5,700 shares. It still holds 18,400 shares of the social media site.
Facebook also fell out of favor with Soros. The investor dumped 367,262 shares of the social networking giant in the last quarter. Soros Fund Management still owns 109,451 Facebook shares.
But not all names in the technology sector were sold off. Soros upped his stake in Microsoft by 99,000 shares and Amazon by 2,500 shares.
The SEC filings only show the change in share ownership of Soros' fund, but no commentary as to his fund's thinking behind the trades.
Major technology stocks have been on a tear this year, although some of the newly-listed names such as Snap have struggled. 
Apple, which Soros' hedge fund also sold all its shares in, is up nearly 48 percent year-to-date. Analysts are excited at the potential of the new iPhone X, released earlier this month. Apple shares hit a record high last week.
Soros' position contrasts to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which topped up on Apple shares in the last quarter. Buffett's conglomerate increased its holdings of the iPhone maker's stock by 3.9 million to 134.1 million, a SEC filing released Tuesday showed.

 });Talkspace CEO Oren Frank
 When disasters from hurricanes to wildfires swept the U.S. this fall, mental health start-up Talkspace turned to Facebook for free advertising to reach victims.
 But while Talkspace CEO Oren Frank says he's grateful for the donation, he was left with mixed feelings about accepting the ads.
Facebook is a near-necessity for companies trying to rapidly reach disaster victims, including Talkspace, which offers online therapy, Frank said. But Frank believes Facebook could take a more active approach when it comes to stewarding the mental health of its users. 
 ""Facebook are currently insisting that they are 'just a platform' and are trying hard to stay away from any content and service plays. My two cents is that Facebook will have to change this approach. It's not sustainable and also it is not the right thing to do,"" Frank said. ""Maybe, hopefully, in time, they'll acknowledge their responsibility for the well being of people who spend so many hours using their services.""

 Roger McNamee: Facebook and Alphabet have behaved irresponsibly   
 11:54  AM ET Tue, 14 Nov 2017 |  05:08 
 Talkspace, which has raised at least $60 million from investors like SoftBank to power online chat-based therapy, offered a free Facebook group to help hurricane survivors, moderated by around 20 Talkspace representatives. There were groups for both Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma, and  Facebook offered a ""very nice number"" of free ads to promote the groups.
These are moderated support groups — not a medical service or traditional therapy. At their peak they had over 1,000 people, Frank said.
""The support groups hosted conversations on a wide variety of topics, including 'What do I do if my eating disorder has been triggered by the stress of the storm?,' as well as 'How do I process my survivor's guilt?' and 'The best ways to handle anxiety when applying for FEMA benefits',"" Frank said.
But Facebook groups like these could reveal who has shown interest in working with a mental health professional — which could be considered a very private aspect of health and safety after trauma. 
""We know that 20 percent to 25 percent of any population will suffer from mental illness every year. This means that in any given time, over 400 million using Facebook are suffering from a clinically diagnosable mental health issue,"" Frank wrote in an email to CNBC. ""I think Facebook, with their unlimited data capabilities, knows this very well, and it's highly likely they also know exactly who the suffering users are.""
 Facebook confirmed it provided credits for Talkspace's ad campaign but could not disclose a dollar amount for the donation. 
After the recent shooting in Las Vegas, Talkspace opted not to use Facebook groups to help employees of Live Nation, Mandalay Bay, the first responders, and the concert goers. The company is instead offering 100 months of free Talkspace therapy, which had to be done on a platform compliant with HIPAA privacy laws, so Facebook would not have suited.
But Talkspace went back to Facebook groups when it came time to reach victims of recent wildfires in northern California.
""We've decided that extending help is the highest priority,"" Frank said. ""Facebook has its own set of considerations which I'm not a part of, but knowing many people who work there, I believe they're driven by doing the right thing and help their users — their willingness to help us is one sign of this.""
 A hard balance
 It's fairly rare for advertising to be donated to a for-profit company, although it makes sense in the case of disaster, said Anthony LaFauce, vice president of Digital at Porter Novelli, and an adjunct professor who teaches social media strategy at American University. BetterHelp, a competing start-up, said it is also providing free services for those impacted by both Harvey and Irma, but a spokesperson said ""it doesn't look like we're supporting the Facebook initiative.""
There's no clear guidance for companies like Facebook and Talkspace when it comes to using health-related data to target advertising.. What happens with self-disclosed health-related data on social media is highly regulated in some ways, but is a grey area in others, LaFauce said.
""[The best practice on ad targeting] walks the balance of counseling and mental health treatment,"" LaFauce said. ""Fifteen years ago, you put yourself in the newspaper, it becomes public. We've been trying to put that into place, but it's hard to understand, with social media, you're entering a public conversation.""
Facebook has made changes to its approach to mental health this year, including more sophisticated outreach to users discussing self-harm and suicide and an investment in its safety and security team. The company also matched more than $1 million in donations for Hurricane Harvey, and donated $1 million to local organizations to help with wildfires in California.
Frank said Talkspace donates at least 500 months of free therapy to audiences and populations that can't afford it each year. But he said would not deliver therapy on a platform like Facebook that ""isn't ours and is not HIPAA compliant.""
""Maybe, hopefully, in time, they'll acknowledge their responsibility for the well being of people who [spend] so many hours using their services. I hope so,"" Frank said.

Tim Cook was the second highest-paid executive of 2016, pulling in $150,036,907
 Apple could launch a video subscription product next year, while Netflix could be forced to introduce new pricing plans, one analyst firm has predicted.
 Tech analysts at CCS Insight released their 12th annual set of predictions about the industry on Wednesday.
One of those is the emergence of an Apple on-demand video service. Original content would feature heavily.
 ""Everyone is jostling for position and everyone is jumping in on the area of video. When you look at Apple, it has a very strong hardware offering and their services business is on the march,"" Paolo Pescatore, vice president of multiplay and media at CCS Insight, told CNBC on the phone.
""The real battleground is in the area of original content, but original content would feature prominent and Apple would be very well placed to do that.""
Software and services is seen as a key growth driver for Apple in the future as smartphone life cycles potentially get longer and as the iPhone-maker looks to monetize is massive user base.
Revenues from services came in at $8.5 billion in the September quarter, growing 34 percent year-on-year.
And video could be a way to boost that further, building off the back of other subscription services like Apple Music.
Apple, the world's largest company by market capitalization, has already dabbled with original content. It acquired rights for ""Carpool Karaoke,"" which debuted on Apple Music this year, for example.
And Chief Executive Tim Cook has also commented on original content, hinting there could be more to come.
""With our toe in the water, we are learning a lot about the original content business, and thinking about ways that we could play in that,"" Cook said in an earnings call in January.
 Netflix new pricing plans
 The changing content landscape could also bring about new moves from the major technology companies, CCS Insight said. The analyst firm is also forecasting that Netflix could introduce new pricing options and services in the quest for new revenue.
Currently, Netflix has three pricing plans in the U.S. that start from $7.99, depending on how many screens a user wants to use the service on and whether he wants shows in higher quality. Netflix recently hiked the price of two of those plans as it continues to fork out billions on content.
With content costs rising and competition in video streaming increasing, Netflix may have to experiment with new options, Pescatore said.
""The prediction is that Netflix gives new pricing options for video to allow people to buy videos or rent them on an a la carte basis. Equally, we expect Netflix to move to other areas and cross-sell games and music into their basis,"" Pescatore told CNBC.
 Facebook PPV
 Social media platforms could also push further into the content game. Facebook has been pushing video on its platform for a while, adding new capabilities such as Facebook Live.
The social network has been involved in bids for sports rights this year and even struck a deal with Fox Sports to stream the UEFA Champions League soccer tournament.
Facebook's interest in sports streaming could see it begin to offer pay-per-view, challenging traditional broadcasters. And with the strength of its targeted advertising, it could be very appealing to sports rights holders.
""The other opportunity for Facebook is even-based advertising. The danger for Facebook, who are moving more into sports, is those premium content owners do not want to give content for free. Facebook cannot rely on advertising alone, but to make the jump in terms of paid content is hard. So Facebook's stepping stone will be showing sport on a pay-per-view basis,"" Pescatore said.

Evan Spiegel, co-founder and chief executive officer of Snap Inc., stands on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during the company's initial public offering on Thursday, March 2, 2017.
 In today’s social media industry, you essentially have two options: Die young, or live long enough to turn into Facebook.
Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, appears to be headed down the latter path. After a disappointing earnings report last week, which sent the company’s stock tumbling by nearly 20 percent, Snap announced a sweeping strategy shift that contained more than a few hints of Facebook envy.
In an attempt to spur user growth, Snap’s chief executive, Evan Spiegel, announced that Snapchat would be redesigned to make it easier to use. The app, which featured a minimalist design that appealed to teenagers while often perplexing their parents, will soon have a personalized feed that uses algorithms to show relevant stories to users, rather than making them sift through a reverse-chronological feed. Twitter made a similar change last year, also under pressure from Facebook.
 Snap has also revamped its ad-buying process to be more like Facebook’s, with ads that can be purchased through an automated system. And it signaled last week that it wanted to expand its presence in the developing world, where Facebook is dominant. Only about 25 percent of Snapchat’s daily active users live outside North America and Europe, compared with more than 65 percent of Facebook’s users.

It’s hard to blame Snap, which declined to comment for this column, for going the Facebook route. Facebook and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, have been trying to copy Snapchat out of existence for years, and they might be succeeding.
Instagram Stories, a near-clone of Snapchat’s most distinctive feature, has reached 300 million daily active users, nearly twice as many as Snapchat. Facebook’s enormous profits have given lofty expectations to investors in other social media companies, and its more than two billion users have made everything else seem small by comparison.
But Snap’s pivot is more than a necessary business move. It’s an indictment of our current tech landscape, and a warning sign for other start-ups hoping to take on the largest internet companies on their own terms. If a wildly creative company with an app used by 178 million people every day can still be crushed by Facebook, how is anyone supposed to succeed?
Snap still has lots of things going for it. It remains popular among American teenagers, perhaps the most highly coveted marketing demographic in the world. Snapchat has more users in the United States who are 12 to 24 years old than either Facebook or Instagram, according to eMarketer. It has also been able to buck Silicon Valley trends and introduced some truly innovative ideas, like the concept that not all digital communication should be permanently archived. And while Snap is losing money, many of its losses stem from changes it has made in order to compete with Facebook.
Still, the fact that Snap’s future is uncertain should worry you, even if you’ve never used its products. A world in which every successful internet platform is expected to behave like Facebook is a more boring, less innovative world, with no companies to challenge Facebook’s vision of the future. It’s not a good sign that in order to survive as a competitor, Snap may have to abandon the qualities that made it different in the first place.
Part of Snapchat’s appeal when it first appeared six years ago was how different it was from other messaging apps and social networks. Its disappearing photos encouraged honest sharing with close friends, rather than showing off to a large audience of acquaintances. Snapchat’s Discover program was one of the first examples of a social network paying publishers to create original, high-quality content. And unlike Mark Zuckerberg, who once said privacy was an outdated concept, Mr. Spiegel believed in safeguarding users’ data, saying in a 2015 interview that “we care about not being creepy.”
Snapchat’s distinctive qualities also helped steer it clear of some problems that are now plaguing its rivals.
It appears that Snapchat, unlike Facebook, was never exploited by Russian propagandists to influence an election, and it has taken a responsible approach to preventing false information from appearing on its platform. (Snap’s vice president for content, Nick Bell, recently told Bloomberg Businessweek, “We only work with authoritative and credible media companies, and we unashamedly have a significant team of producers, creators and journalists.”) Snapchat has not been overrun by bots and neo-Nazis, as Twitter has. And unlike Google, Snap has not harvested its users’ data in order to chase them around the internet with spammy ads for diet pills and miracle teas.
Snapchat isn’t perfect by any means, and some of the company’s wounds have been self-inflicted. Snap has misled users about its data collection practices in the past, which led to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. It spent millions of dollars developing Spectacles, a pair of sunglasses with a built-in Snapchat camera, that everyone talked about but few bought. (Last week, the company wrote off $40 million in losses on the project.) And nobody forced Mr. Spiegel to raise billions of dollars from investors who would demand Facebook-style growth.
Billy Gallagher, a former TechCrunch writer whose book on Snap’s corporate history, “How to Turn Down a Billion Dollars,” will come out next year, characterized the company’s recent changes as “death by a thousand paper cuts.” He told me that while investors might appreciate touches like an automated ad-buying system and a more intuitive app, Snapchat’s core users could feel betrayed.
“A social network acts against users’ interests when it needs to make money,” he said.
Snapchat, Mr. Gallagher writes, was never supposed to be just a photo-sharing app. It was the embodiment of Mr. Spiegel’s worldview about how the internet should work — temporary instead of permanent, private instead of public, candid instead of rehearsed. I asked Mr. Gallagher why Snap needed to compromise its values in pursuit of Facebook-style growth. Couldn’t it reject Wall Street’s demands, concentrate on making its existing users happy and be satisfied as a smaller and more focused company?
Mr. Gallagher said Snap’s employees, many of whom joined because they believed that the company would grow to enormous size, might bristle at any strategy that would hurt the value of their stock options. And he pointed out that Mr. Spiegel, a grandiose 27-year-old who reportedly keeps a portrait of Steve Jobs on a wall of his office, might not be satisfied with merely modest success.
“He has grand, sweeping visions of the future,” Mr. Gallagher said. “It would be very hard for him to eat a slice of humble pie and say: ‘We’re not going to be Facebook. We’re going to be a 150-million-user social network that plays in a well carved-out niche.’”
Last week, Mr. Spiegel pledged to keep Snap’s core values intact while expanding its business. But growth often comes at the expense of experimentation, and Snap’s decision to become more like Facebook is a worrisome sign for people who care about preserving the internet’s quirky heterogeneity. Snapchat’s users were once offered something genuinely different, but it may be time for them to expect more of the same.

 Construction has begun on a wind farm that will supply 100 percent of the power required to operate a Facebook data center in Papillion, Nebraska.  The Rattlesnake Creek wind farm in Dixon County, Nebraska, will have a capacity of 320 megawatts (MW). Under a power purchase agreement, Facebook will buy power from 200 MW of the farm's capacity to operate its data center.  Facebook's director of global energy, Bobby Hollis, said that the business was now ""one step closer to our goal of powering all of our operations with clean and renewable energy.""  A subsidiary of Enel Green Power North America (EGPNA), Rattlesnake Creek Wind Project, owns the site. EGPNA is the U.S. renewable energy business of the Enel Group; investment in the facility's construction is approximately $430 million.
 According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. is ""home to one of the largest and fastest-growing wind markets in the world.""
The Enel site will produce roughly 1.3 terawatt hours per year when fully operational. This will be enough to meet the ""equivalent annual consumption needs"" of over 105,000 U.S. homes, Enel said, helping to avoid the emission of around 940,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.
 ""This project consolidates our growing presence in the U.S. as our company enters into a new state and expands our business with new partners,"" Antonio Cammisecra, the head of Enel Green Power, said in a statement. ""We are thrilled to be able to support Facebook's growing renewable energy needs in Nebraska and be a part of driving economic development in the region,"" Cammisecra added.

 Facebook will be the only place to watch 47 college basketball games this season. 
 Multi-platform sports network Stadium announced on Thursday it was streaming 47 college basketball games exclusively through Facebook this season. The games feature teams from the Mountain West, West Coast Conference, Conference USA, and the Atlantic 10 divisions, including Dayton, Saint Mary's, Wake Forest, VCU,  Pittsburgh, UNLV, Utah, Washington State, Ole Miss, George Washington, and UMass, among others. 
Stadium's on-air talent will interact with comments posted on Facebook in real-time, and the company will also post a Facebook-only 30-minute commentary show on every Wednesday evening. Stadium will also make other college games it owns the streaming rights to available on other digital platforms, including its own app and Pluto TV .
 The announcement signals Facebook's further expansion into live sports content. Stadium and Facebook previously partnered earlier this year to stream 15 college football games exclusively. The 13 games that have aired so far this year have received almost 10 million total views, according to Stadium. Facebook has also streamed some NBA and MLB regular season games, but those were available to watch on via other methods.

Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017.
 Facebook hoping to court more video creators to its platform with the launch of a new app.
 The Facebook Creator App will make it easier for users to create original video and livestreams via their mobile devices. It will also give them new tools, including the ability to add intros or outros to live broadcasts, different camera effects, and designed frames around videos. Users will also have access to data and analytics about their videos. Facebook first announced plans to launch an app for creators at in June.
The company is also introducing a hub where video creators can learn more about creating video for Facebook as well as get questions answered. Website members will also be considered for early access to new video features.
 ""To help creators grow on Facebook, it's important that we continue building tools for them to be successful, which is why I'm really excited about two new updates launching today for creators,"" Facebook vice president of product Fidji Simo said on her Facebook page. ""We're rolling out a new app that will be a one-stop shop for creators of all sizes, which will let creators easily make original videos, go live with exclusive features, and connect with their community on Facebook. We've also launched a new website dedicated to providing creators with inspiration, support, and education.""
Facebook has been attempting to get more people and companies to move their videos to its platform. It introduced a hub for original shows called Watch in August and added ways to monetize video likeads that play in the middle of livestreams earlier this year. It also allows users to have sponsored content.
However it has yet to widely roll out the ability to add commercials to all videos like its competitor YouTube. Though today's announcement isn't related to allowing users to make money on their videos, it does make the path to creating content for the platform a lot smoother.

86,2017-11-17,Two bills in Congress could impact Google and Facebook ad sales  ,"Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images
Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio
 The U.S. Senate is considering two bills that could, if made into law, dent ad growth at Facebook, Google parent Alphabet and other internet companies.
 As is often the case in Washington, the bill with the lower profile has a better chance of becoming law.
 Goodbye to a key internet loophole?
 That's the bill the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Technology passed and sent to the full Senate for consideration on November 8.
 Dubbed SESTA, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, it would take away a key legal defense that internet companies have enjoyed since 1996.
That's when Congress granted a loophole to companies that host internet services on their web sites, which absolved them of liability for content their users uploaded.
That loophole now stands in the way of the SESTA bill launched by Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, which has been pushed by advocates for victims of human and sex trafficking.

 Russian-bought Facebook ads could have reached millions of voters   
 4:11  PM ET Fri, 29 Sept 2017 |  00:55 
 It has the momentum of moral justice, because thousands of women, girls and boys have been exploited and had their lives destroyed by predators they've met online.
Because the legislation launched by Portman, a Republican, deals with the most unsavory underbelly of the internet, few have talked about it — except for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Columbia Journalism Review and other advocates of free speech online.
Those organizations point out that repealing what's called the exemption of Section 230 of the 1996 Telecom Act could have an unintended and dire consequence.
It could cause Google and Facebook to restrict the uploading of legally-risky content to their sites and give them de facto market control over internet speech.
For the companies, that could mean lower sales of the ads that have made them two darlings of growth investors. 
Shares of Google parent Alphabet have surged almost 30 percent this year, while Facebook has soared 55 percent.
 Stop the Russians!
 Portman's bill has gotten less attention than another introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and backed by other Democrats, including Senator Mark Warner, ranking member of the Intelligence Committee.
That bill, which is also co-sponsored by Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, deals with a different exemption enjoyed by Google and Facebook, one having to do with disclosures for online political ads.
That bill, the Honest Ads Act, has the support of more than 30 members of Congress. It would require political ads that air online to have the same disclosures that political ads on radio and TV currently do -- like who paid for the ad.
It's high profile given that executives of the companies — and another from Twitter — were grilled in both houses of Congress earlier this month, after Russian propagandists used those platforms to try to influence the 2016 election.
The bill could crimp revenue growth at the internet companies, since foreign people and organizations would no longer be able to buy ads, and the long list of legally mandated disclosures would make these ads less attractive on mobile devices.
That matters, given that political ad sales have grown sharply, based on a report from Borrell and Associates. 
Yet its chances of passage are further away than those for Portman's bill.
Of the 33 members of Congress who sent a signed comment to the election commission backing new rules, not one was a member of the GOP majority.
The Klobuchar bill, introduced in October, sits with the Senate rules committee and has not been put to a committee vote, let alone cleared one, as Portman's bill has.
Neither bill is a sure thing, given that Google over the last two years has been among the largest U.S. corporate spenders on lobbying.
Yet of the two pieces of legislation, the one backed by Portman and headed for the full Senate already, is more likely to impact investors first.
Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified a bill co-sponsored by Senators Klobuchar and Warner. The Honest Ads Act was introduced Oct. 19.

'Pony' Ma Huateng, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tencent Holdings Ltd.
 Tencent shares hit a record high Monday, bringing its valuation to over $500 billion.
 The technology firm is the first from China to reach the landmark valuation as it closes in on the likes of Facebook and Amazon.
The Hong Kong-listed internet giant, known for its WeChat messaging app and online games, saw shares rally to 420 Hong Kong dollars ($53.76) on Monday. Its market capitalization, or total value of all the shares in circulation, stood at 3.99 trillion Hong Kong dollars ($510.7 billion) at the market close.
 Tencent's market cap is above Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, which stands at $474.15 billion, and Baidu at $82.97 billion.
It is closing in on U.S. technology firms including Facebook, which is worth $520.14 billion, and Amazon, which is valued at $544.46 billion.
Tencent went public in Hong Kong in 2004 at 3.70 Hong Kong dollars per share. Since then, it has rallied 11,251 percent. Tencent's stock this year alone is up 121.4 percent.
The share price has been driven by Tencent's continued revenue growth, massive user base and investments into new areas. Last week, the Chinese company reported a 67 percent year-on-year rise in net profit for the third quarter, beating market expectations.
Tencent is a sprawling business. One of its key products is China's most popular messaging service, WeChat, which is now approaching 1 billion users.

 Overseas expansion for Tencent is not a 'zero-sum game': executive   
 8:21  PM ET Thu, 16 Nov 2017 |  02:52 
 Online and mobile games are a key part of the business — the division brought in over $4 billion of revenues last quarter. Last year, Tencent acquired a majority stake in Finnish smartphone maker Supercell, the company behind the popular ""Clash of Clans"" mobile game.
Other fast-growing parts of the business include digital content such as video, as well as online advertising.
While Tencent may not be a household name in the U.S., it's continuing to push into new areas, including making big investments in America. It has acquired stakes in both Tesla and Snap, and invested in numerous start-ups in Asia including India's Uber rival Ola.
Analysts have a positive view on Tencent. Barclays raised its price target from $49 to $59 on Monday. Last week, Daiwa Capital Markets raised its price target to 480 Hong Kong dollars. In a note, analyst John Choi said that he still sees earnings upside in 2018 driven by a ""robust"" mobile game pipeline and increasing online advertising monetization.
""Tencent's disciplined execution and well-positioned multi-engine growth strategy should sustain its valuation premium in the medium to long-term,"" Daiwa said in a note on November 15.

 A former operations manager responsible for Facebook's privacy efforts said the company ""prioritized data collection from its users over protecting them from abuse.""
 In a sharply critical New York Times opinion piece that published Monday, Sandy Parakilas said Facebook ""has no incentive to police the collection or use of data,"" on its users, given its business model of selling online ads.
""I led Facebook's efforts to fix privacy problems on its developer platform in advance of its 2012 initial public offering. What I saw from the inside was a company that prioritized data collection from its users over protecting them from abuse,"" he wrote in the post.
 ""The fact that Facebook prioritized data collection over user protection and regulatory compliance is precisely what made it so attractive"" to advertisers, wrote Parakilas, who worked as an operations manager on the platform team at Facebook in 2011 and 2012.
Facebook ad sales are expected to climb 45 percent this year to $27.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. This growth has helped push up its shares more than 50 percent this year and made founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg the world's fifth-richest person, according to Forbes.
Parakilas suggested the company Zuckerberg leads is obsessed with its press coverage and will only protect user data ""when negative press or regulators are involved.""
""The message was clear: The company just wanted negative stories to stop. It didn't really care how the data was used,"" said Parakilas, who is not the first former manager at the company to criticize it this year.
""Lawmakers shouldn't allow Facebook to regulate itself. Because it won't,"" Parakilas wrote, referring to several bills before Congress, one which would rely on Facebook itself to report users who violate its rules on hate speech and another to enforce a buyer disclaimer on political ads.
In reply to an email seeking comment, a Facebook spokesperson referred CNBC to a post written by Justin Osofsky, vice president of global operations. 
""While it's fair to criticize how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it's untrue to suggest we didn't or don't care about privacy,"" Osofsky wrote in the Nov. 20 post, which also noted the company's obligations under a prior settlement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
In 2011, the FTC had charged that Facebook deceived consumers by telling them they could keep their information on the site private ""and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public.""
Noting the agreement that was created the following year, to settle the charges, Osofsky wrote:
""Our privacy program, created in 2012, includes hundreds of people from a variety of teams across the company. This group works with product managers and engineers to protect people's data, to give people information about how our features work, and to provide people control over how their data is used.""

 Credit Suisse is bullish on technology and internet retail, despite whopping valuations and an impressive tear since January.
 While tech and internet retail stocks – a group Credit Suisse dubs ""Tech+"" – have added 88 percent since the beginning of 2014, the S&P 500 has only posted 26 percent over the same time excluding Tech+, according to chief equity strategist Jonathan Golub.
""TECH+ revenues and earnings look particularly attractive on both a forward and trailing basis,"" wrote Golub on Monday. ""Price volatility for TECH+ stocks has declined more than any other sector over the past 20 years. The group is less economically sensitive than other cyclical groups and deploys less financial leverage.""

Ma Huateng, chairman and chief executive officer of Tencent Holdings Ltd., speaks during the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Forum in Hong Kong, China, on Tuesday, June 20, 2017.
 Chinese internet giant Tencent has surpassed Facebook in terms of market value just a day after it became the first Asian technology firm to reach the $500 billion valuation mark.
 Tencent shares hit a record high of 439.6 Hong Kong dollars during Asian trading hours on Tuesday, giving it a market capitalization of 4.17 trillion Hong Kong dollars ($534.5 billion).
The Chinese firm's value overtook Facebook's $519.4 billion market capitalization, which was hit at the close of the U.S. markets on Monday.
 Also Monday, Tencent beat Alibaba to become the first Chinese technology company to hit the $500 billion market capitalization mark. Tencent is also within touching distance of Amazon's $542.7 billion valuation.
Tencent went public in Hong Kong in 2004 at 3.70 Hong Kong dollars per share. Since then, it has rallied over 11,000 percent. Tencent's stock this year alone is up 126.69 percent.
Still, the company is not well-known outside of China, but owns the country's most popular messaging service, WeChat, which has close to 1 billion users. Tencent is a sprawling business that spans gaming, social media, news and content.
Online and mobile games are a key part of the business — the division brought in over $4 billion in revenue last quarter. In 2016, Tencent acquired a majority stake in Finnish smartphone maker Supercell, the company behind the popular ""Clash of Clans"" mobile game.

 Tencent has also been trying to move outside of China, but not necessarily through the expansion of its own products. Instead, it has been making investments across the U.S. and Asia. It has acquired stakes in both Tesla and Snap, and invested in numerous start-ups in Asia, including India's Uber rival Ola.
Analysts were positive on Tencent's stock after it smashed past market expectations when it reported third quarter earnings earlier this month. Barclays raised its price target for Tencent from $49 to $59, and upped its revenue forecasts for 2018 and 2019.
""We mainly attribute accelerating revenue growth to the continued monetization improvement across multiple key business segments, such as gaming, video, and payment services, and note that user growth is still strong,"" Barclays said in a note on Monday.

 Facebook is still allowing people to post housing ads that illegally discriminate against certain ethnic groups or people with disabilities, according to ProPublica.
 ProPublica reported in October 2016 it was able to buy an ad in Facebook's housing category and exclude black, Hispanic or Asian-Americans from seeing it. Discriminating against specific races, colors, religions, sex, handicaps, familial status and national origin when it comes to housing ads is against the law under the Fair Housing Act. Facebook said it added new tools in February to prevent the issue. 
But a new ProPublica report shows the publication bought housing ads recently -- and was still allowed to block groups including African Americans, people interested in wheelchair ramps, Jews, and Spanish speakers from seeing it. Most ads were approved within three minutes, except for an exclusion for people ""interested in Islam, Sunni Islam and Shia Islam"" which was also eventually approved. 
 While the ad bought in October 2016 was about a community meeting about housing, the recent housing ad was about rental apartments, which would make it illegal. 
Facebook admitted it allowed the ads, and apologized for the error in a statement. Ami Vora, VP of product management, said the company will add a notification across all categories for anyone who places an ad that excludes certain groups of people. Purchasers will have to acknowledge they are posting in accordance with Facebook's policies and the law.
""This was a failure in our enforcement and we're disappointed that we fell short of our commitments,"" Vora said in the statement.
 ""Earlier this year, we added additional safeguards to protect against the abuse of our multicultural affinity tools to facilitate discrimination in housing, credit and employment. The rental housing ads purchased by ProPublica should have but did not trigger the extra review and certifications we put in place due to a technical failure. Our safeguards, including additional human reviewers and machine learning systems have successfully flagged millions of ads and their effectiveness has improved over time. Tens of thousands of advertisers have confirmed compliance with our tighter restrictions, including that they follow all applicable laws. We don't want Facebook to be used for discrimination and will continue to strengthen our policies, hire more ad reviewers, and refine machine learning tools to help detect violations. Our systems continue to improve but we can do better. While we currently require compliance notifications of advertisers that seek to place ads for housing, employment, and credit opportunities, we will extend this requirement to ALL advertisers who choose to exclude some users from seeing their ads on Facebook to also confirm their compliance with our anti-discrimination policies – and the law."" 
A source close to the situation said there was a coding error which did not prevent discriminatory tactics from being used on rental ads. However housing ads that pertained to purchasing property were properly screened. 
Facebook also faced scrutiny over its ad targeting capabilities in September, when another ProPublica report showed the platform allowed ads to be shown to people who identified as ""Jew haters"" and other anti-semitic terms. The company responded by adding more features to block the use of derogatory terms to target users, as well as hiring more people to look over ads before they post.

 Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban believes Facebook and Alphabet's Google unit will be ""big losers"" of the Department of Justice's decision to sue to block the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner.
 In a tweet Monday, Cuban said, ""Their media advertising, content and distribution dominance will be a defense at trial. That could create bigger issues for them.""
 Mark Cuban tweet
 The Justice Department on Monday sued to block AT&T's $85 billion merger deal with Time Warner,calling it an ""illegal"" combination that harms consumers and stifles innovation, officials said.
AT&T and Time Warner announced their merger agreement last year, but the closing has been dragged out by the government's antitrust review.
A Justice Department official told reporters on Monday that the merger would raise prices for consumers and potentially block creators of media content from distributing their product without paying more money. Time Warner owns various networks in addition to CNN, including TBS, TNT and Cartoon Network. It also has lucrative sports broadcasting deals.

 The Facebook-PayPal relationship keeps getting friendlier.
 The companies announced Tuesday that PayPal users can send invoices over Facebook Messenger, expanding a partnership announced last month that allowed Messenger users to link to their PayPal accounts for sending and receiving money. 
The agreement is moving from peer-to-peer payments to include the buying and selling of products in Facebook's marketplace. PayPal's buyer protection is also available for transactions.
 Sellers can create an invoice within Messenger and then send it to the buyer. This is available in the U.S., where PayPal has over 2.5 million accounts that are already linked to Facebook.
By partnering with PayPal, Facebook Messenger becomes a competitor to mobile payment services like Apple's new Pay Cash, Square Cash, Snap and PayPal's own Venmo application.

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook
 Facebook users will soon be able to check if and when they followed Russia-sponsored accounts surrounding the 2016 presidential election, the company announced Wednesday. 
 It's another step — and so far, the most user-specific — in an effort to shed light on Russian meddling before and during the presidential election.
Russian accounts were found to have to steered discourse and cultural opinion on the social media platform and its sister platform, Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. Congress has since launched investigations into the Russian meddling. 
 Facebook, through members of Congress, has already made public some of the paid ads and so-called ""organic content"" distributed by Russian accounts. But this is the first attempt to notify individual Facebook users that they were exposed to the content.
""It is important that people understand how foreign actors tried to sow division and mistrust using Facebook before and after the 2016 US election,"" the company said in a statement. 
The portal will be live by the end of the year, Facebook said, and will show users which accounts sponsored by the Internet Research Agency — a known Russia-backed page — they liked or followed between January 2015 and August 2017.

President-elect Donald Trump speaks as PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member Peter Thiel (C) and Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook look on during a meeting with technology leaders at Trump Tower in New York U.S., December 14, 2016.
 Peter Thiel sold the majority of his remaining Facebook shares this week, serving as a reminder of how much money he left on the table in a prior sale.
 According to a filing with the SEC on Tuesday, Thiel sold roughly three-quarters of his remaining Facebook stock on Nov. 20, netting him $28.7 million.
The PayPal co-founder and venture investor was an early backer of Facebook, investing $500,000 in 2004, gaining a board seat that he still holds and 2.5 percent of the company at the time of the IPO. 
 While Thiel is in no way hurting for cash, he would have been much wealthier had he stashed those Facebook shares away after the 2012 IPO.
Instead, as part of a pre-arranged plan, he sold almost 80 percent of his stake within a few months of the IPO at an average price of less than $20 a share. Facebook is now trading at $180.50.

 Facebook's Russia problem won't affect revenues: Ben Dunbar   
 5:02  PM ET Wed,  1 Nov 2017 |  03:25 
 Looking back five years, his timing was terrible. Facebook shares fell sharply soon after the IPO, as investors doubted the company's ability to transition its advertising business to mobile. They were very wrong.
The shares Thiel sold for close to $400 million would now be worth over $3.6 billion.
""He and his firm missed out on a lot of upside,"" says Ben Silverman, director of research at InsiderScore.com.
Forbes estimates Thiel's worth at $2.6 billion, thanks largely to his non-Facebook activities. Thiel put his money to work as a hedge fund manager and venture capitalist. His venture firm, Founders Fund, was an early investor in Palantir, one of the most valuable technology start-ups. 
An email to Thiel seeking comment wasn't immediately returned.
Thiel held 220,718 Class A Facebook shares and 54,995 Class B shares as of March 31, according to the company's annual proxy filing. He sold 60,300 Class A shares in July.

90,2017-11-24,"As Facebook Settles In, Residents Move Out  ","Jason Henry | The New York Times
Adela Morales and Adrian Bonilla with their grandchildren Jaslene Orozco, 9, and Raul Orozco, 10, who live together in a recreational vehicle in East Palo Alto, Calif., Nov. 22, 2017. Wherever Facebook’s co-founder Mark Zuckerberg goes in Silicon Valley, he seems to generate a housing problem, including at this RV community where residents were evicted this month.
 Adrian Bonilla lived in a shared house in this Silicon Valley town with his wife and two grandchildren until earlier this year, when the rent for their bedroom jumped to $1,200 from $900 a month. Mr. Bonilla attributed that rise to Facebook, which is based nearby and was growing.
So Mr. Bonilla, a 43-year-old mechanic and Uber driver, bought a 1991 recreational vehicle and joined a family-oriented R.V. community on a quiet cul-de-sac. They lived there until last week, when Mr. Bonilla received an eviction notice.
This time, Mr. Bonilla said, the reason he had to move was because the city wanted to clear the way for ''the Facebook school.'' That school is funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a limited liability company set up by Facebook's co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, to work on social change endeavors. Ms. Chan is a co-founder of the school, a private institution for low-income children called the Primary School.
 Despite the good will behind the school, it has been met with wariness.
''The school is a Facebook school. It's not a city school,'' Mr. Bonilla said, adding that he knew he would have to move again when he heard about it. ''When Facebook comes, everybody moves everywhere.''
Mr. Zuckerberg is already facing plenty of troubles across the globe, including questions about Russian interference on Facebook during the 2016 election. The skirmish between the couple's initiative and the R.V. community, which city officials said was becoming a flood hazard, is a reminder of how the billionaire also faces difficulties on his own doorstep.
For many in East Palo Alto, which is just blocks from Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., no C.E.O. and company have come to embody the anxieties of the modern tech boom more than Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook. At a meeting last Wednesday at East Palo Alto's City Hall, about 100 residents and protesters gathered with city staff to discuss their housing and some invoked Mr. Zuckerberg's name.
''I want to talk about the elephant in the room,'' said Zach Kirk, 20, a Stanford University student who grew up in Palo Alto. ''Actually, he's not in the room, he's in some mansion: Mark Zuckerberg.''
Wherever Mr. Zuckerberg goes in Silicon Valley, he seems to generate a housing problem. In 2014, after the tech mogul bought a house in San Francisco, neighbors complained about construction, his security detail, the parking and how his presence would inflate prices. Earlier this year, protesters marched in East Palo Alto to denounce the displacement of residents because of big tech companies like Facebook.
The battles are likely to grow as Facebook continues its expansion in Menlo Park, with 1.75 million square feet of new office space expected to be built. The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has also been growing, staffing up as it prepares to invest Mr. Zuckerberg's enormous fortune in efforts like his stated goal to ''cure, prevent, and manage all disease.''
Community members expect more tension later this month at an East Palo Alto town hall hosted by Real Community Coalition, a local citizens group, and featuring Facebook. At the meeting, residents will have the opportunity to ask Facebook executives questions about the company's role in the community.
''Connections are at the core of everything we do at Facebook and our relationship with residents of East Palo Alto is no different,'' Juan Salazar, a public policy manager for Facebook, said in a statement.
The social network has been lobbying to build more housing in the region, which Silicon Valley cities, worried about traffic and preferring a commercial over residential tax base, have fought against. In East Palo Alto, Facebook has invested $18.5 million into the Catalyst Housing Fund, an affordable housing initiative; the company has set a goal to grow the fund to $75 million.
The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which is also writing grants for affordable housing, said working side by side with local communities was ''core to our work.'' In a statement, the Primary School said the episode with the R.V. residents was ''frustrating and emblematic of larger housing issues in the Bay Area,'' but that it was not aware of East Palo Alto's action to evict those residents and had not engaged with city officials on the matter.
East Palo Alto's residents have long felt disempowered against change brought by tech leaders like Mr. Zuckerberg. A 2.6-square-mile town where one-third of the school children are homeless, it has stood as a sign that Silicon Valley's wealth might not spread to those beyond its tech campuses. And so even as Mr. Zuckerberg's limited liability company seeks to build a school here, many of its residents are skeptical.
''CZI's just walking into something with a lot of baggage,'' said Daniel Saver, a lawyer with the Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, which receives funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. ''People here have been pushed around by very big interests and have been taken advantage of for decades. ''
Paul Bains, a pastor and president of Project WeHope, a local organization funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, said that the initiative needed to figure out how to interact with wary residents. ''They have to learn how to communicate with communities of color,'' Mr. Bains said.
The recent evictions at the R.V. enclave were not requested by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, said Donna Rutherford, an East Palo Alto City Council member and a former mayor of the town. Instead, city officials said the area had become a flood hazard as rains were coming and the vehicles had spilled wastewater into storm drains.
''Let me just walk you through the gross part,'' said Michelle Daher, an environmental management analyst for East Palo Alto, heading to a storm drain last week where she said 6,000 gallons of waste from R.V.s had to be pumped one day.
Ms. Daher pointed out the future site of the school, an empty lot surrounded by a chain-link fence. ''This obviously is the Chan Zuckerberg location,'' she said. She added that the flood-prone street would be rebuilt for the school, so the R.V.s would have had to move in any case.
Sean Charpentier, East Palo Alto's assistant city manager, said the region had been squeezed by the wealth around it and that the homeless population had grown. ''We're a receptacle for the externalities around us,'' he said. ''It's felt more deeply here because this city was formed to provide safe and affordable housing.''
Patricia Lopez, 48, who owns a home on the street where the R.V.s were parked, said the trouble for the R.V. residents began after a community meeting that Facebook executives attended.
''They didn't introduce themselves, but the organizer said, 'Facebook is in the house,' and they waved. And ever since then, it's been heavy harassment, heavy policing,'' she said, which ultimately led to the evictions.

At last week's City Hall meeting, residents and protesters expressed support for the school but anxiety over the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.
''The first step is to make sure quasi-affiliated supposed philanthropic organizations don't set the policy,'' said Johannes Muenzel, 28, a software engineer who is the co-chairman of Silicon Valley's Democratic Socialists of America chapter.
Mr. Kirk, the Stanford student, stood in the back, organizing other students. He said he had never seen so much grass-roots energy to protest among his cohort.
''It's sprung up out of nowhere. This is the issue we need to focus on,"" he said, adding that it was remarkable to get so many Stanford students protesting on a school night.
By 11 p.m., protesters and city staff were getting agitated and tired. Eventually, the Public Works and Transportation Commission recommended that city staff pursue a long-term solution for the R.V. community by working with nonprofit organizations and by looking into a ban on oversize vehicles parking overnight.
Facebook said a senior executive attended the meeting. Nearly 50 community members spoke that night. The Facebook executive did not.

91,2017-11-28,Facebook turns to A.I. to help prevent suicides  Facebook and Alphabet hit record highs as investors shrug off inappropriate content and ads  ,"Dado Ruvic | Getty Images
 Facebook is looking to use artificial intelligence (AI) to help detect suicidal thoughts and feelings.
 The move is part of the social media giant's ongoing effort to ""help build a safe community on and off Facebook.""
Facebook said in an official blogpost Monday that it was adopting ""proactive detection efforts"" to help people who are expressing thoughts of suicide on the platform, including the use of pattern recognition to detect posts or live videos where suicidal thoughts are being expressed.
 Facebook said that the additional work it was doing included:
 Using pattern recognition to detect posts or live videos where someone might be expressing thoughts of suicide, and to help respond to reports faster Improving how Facebook identifies appropriate first responders Dedicating more reviewers from the platform's Community Operations team, which includes a team of specialists who have specific mental health training, to review reports of suicide and self-harm. 
The development comes after several high-profile suicides and suicide attempts have been broadcast on Facebook Live. Multiple other social media platforms have also been used to either livestream suicides or express suicidal thoughts.
Facebook has previously asked its users to report to it any suicidal content they find, but the latest efforts go much further by using AI to detect suicidal thoughts before users have to proactively report their concerns to the tech company.
Commenting on the work, Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president of product management, said that ""when someone is expressing thoughts of suicide, it's important to get them help as quickly as possible.
""Facebook is a place where friends and family are already connected and we are able to help connect a person in distress with people who can support them. It's part of our ongoing effort to help build a safe community on and off Facebook.""

 4:38  PM ET Wed, 22 Nov 2017 |  01:50 
 Rosen said that the company was ""starting to roll out artificial intelligence outside the U.S. to help identify when someone might be expressing thoughts of suicide, including on Facebook Live.""
""This approach uses pattern recognition technology to help identify posts and live streams as likely to be expressing thoughts of suicide. We continue to work on this technology to increase accuracy and avoid false positives before our team reviews.""
This will eventually be available worldwide, except in the EU, he said. CNBC has asked Facebook for comment on why the EU will be exempt from the use of AI, but there's some speculation that it's related to complexities surrounding data protection regulation and privacy laws. Facebook would not confirm this however, when contacted by CNBC, saying that it regularly talks with experts and other stakeholders in Europe and understands that it is a sensitive issue.
Rosen said the company uses signals like the content of posts and the comments below — for example, comments like ""Are you OK?"" and ""Can I help?"" can be strong indicators. In some instances, Facebook has found that the technology has identified videos that may have gone unreported, it said.
The developments were part of Facebook's ""ongoing commitment to suicide prevention,"" Rosen said, adding that the network already had dedicated teams working 24/7 around the world ""who review reports (of concerns of suicide and self-harm) that come in and prioritize the most serious reports.""
He said the company had been working on suicide prevention tools for more than 10 years and that its latest approach was developed in collaboration with mental health organizations — such as Save.org, National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Forefront Suicide Prevention — and with input from people who have had personal experience thinking about or attempting suicide.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook.
 Investors don't appear to be concerned by the inability of Google and Facebook to keep illegal or unsavory content and ads off their services.
 Stock prices of both internet giants hit fresh intraday highs Tuesday, extending their 2017 bull runs.
Google parent Alphabet shares touched a record $1,080 before slipping into the red to close the day at $1,063.29. Facebook traded as high as $184.25, then closed down slightly at $182.42.
 The recent records have come despite a wave of revelations showing that both companies cannot effectively police all the content and ads on their services.
In November alone, the firms have taken down problematic content or advertising on several occasions only after being alerted by news organizations.
For Facebook, that content has included pages or posts illegally marketing prescription drugs and housing ads that discriminated based on race.
YouTube also hosted opioid marketing and exploitive videos of children, replete with comments from pedophiles.
YouTube said in a statement that in the past week it had removed 150,000 videos, turned off comments on 625,000 and removed ads from ""nearly 2 million.""
These recent stories follow the discovery earlier this year that Russian propagandists used the services of both companies to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election.
So why the disconnect between negative headlines and record stock prices? If Facebook and Google are failing consistently at keeping users away from harmful content, why are investors so bullish on their prospects?
Because the same massive reach and targeting technology that can be used to target racist landlords or opioid users can also help legitimate online marketers find consumers ready to buy everything from shampoo to cars.
Thanks to that advertising demand, sales at both companies are expected to surge this year, supporting their bull runs.
Alphabet sales are expected to climb 22 percent to $110 billion in 2017, while Facebook revenue is seen rising 45 percent to $40 billion, based on the estimates of stock analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
That growth has powered both stocks higher, outpacing the gains of the broader market for tech stocks.
Facebook shares have risen almost 60 percent this year, while those of Google parent Alphabet just over 30 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index is up 28 percent.

 Investors are ditching popular tech stocks for financials   
 2:56  PM ET Wed, 29 Nov 2017 |  00:43 
 Some of the market's best-performing technology stocks so far this year are tanking Wednesday. 
 So-called FANG stocks all dropped with Facebook down 4 percent, Amazon off by 2.7 percent, Netflix falling 5.5 percent and Google-parent Alphabet lower by 2.4 percent. The PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index, fell 1.7 percent on heavy volume. The fund traded more than 70.4 million shares Wednesday, well above its 30-day volume average of 25.9 million.
Semiconductor names are also falling. Nvidia shares dropped 6.7 percent, while Micron fell 8.7 percent. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF declined 4.2 percent.
 As popular tech stocks fell, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund rose 1.7 percent. And the Dow Jones industrial average was still up almost 80 points even with the tech drop.
Nasdaq Composite declined more than 1 percent because of the drop in tech, on pace for its biggest fall in three months. 
""It's surprising that you're seeing a pullback this big after such a strong fundamental performance,"" said Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners, noting that tech earnings have been strong. ""I do wonder if there is some rotation going on. The banks' story is getting better after Jerome Powell's testimony.""

 Earlier this week, Morgan Stanley lowered its ratings on several chip stocks such as Western Digital, Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor to equal weight from overweight, sparking a sell-off in the semiconductor sector.
""We think now is the time to reduce exposure to NAND [flash memory] and Asian semiconductor names as the industry has benefitted from sizeable demand tailwinds and unprecedented pricing power, which we see reversing soon,"" analyst Shawn Kim wrote in a note to clients Sunday entitled ""Time For a Pause."" ""This reflects our negative view of prospects for the global memory industry, which is currently at a peak.""

 Barclays: Facebook to soar nearly 20%   
 12:54  PM ET Wed, 29 Nov 2017 |  00:38 
 Facebook should be able to drive advertising prices higher to help offset a deceleration in ad impressions, according to Barclays.
 Instagram and Facebook Messenger, two apps owned by Facebook, could also provide a boost to additional impression growth, according to analyst Ross Sandler, who reiterated his buy rating.
""Facebook is the best pure play in consumer internet around mobile advertising, and continues to take a large share of mobile advertising budgets,"" Sandler wrote on Tuesday. ""Google was able to increase price at a healthy clip for over a decade, so we think Facebook is in a good position to do the same.
 ""Ad product innovation coupled with favorable macro advertising share shift dynamics should drive share of digital and mobile ad spend for the foreseeable future,"" he wrote.
Facebook's ad impression deceleration over the past three quarters has been a topic of much debate on Wall Street as investors try to determine whether the slowdown is permanent. While impression growth has been slowing for a while, Facebook's eCPM, a popular measure of ad cost, has been ramping.
If one wanted to take a ""pessimistic"" view of Facebook's performance in the third quarter, core Facebook ad impression growth may not have even grown in the U.S., according to the Barclays report. Like Google before it, Facebook's future success will likely hinge on its ability to push price (not volume) over several years as impressions taper.
""Facebook's holy grail is finding a way to unlock value in its abundance of upper-funnel impressions, and getting its 6 million+ advertisers to pay slightly more for each of those impressions,"" explained Sandler. ""Products like custom audiences and retargeting are helpful to identify users more granularly than what was occurring before these products launched.""
To be sure, the analyst is still largely positive on Mark Zuckerberg's social media behemoth. His $215 price target reflects 18 percent upside over the next 12 months. Shares of Facebook fell 4 percent Wednesday but are up nearly 60 percent since January.

 });As tech companies continue to raise the bar to secure top talent, American workers are responding by applying for open positions in droves.
 With companies like Microsoft, Facebook, IBM and Amazon receiving thousands of applications a year, your hiring chances may appear slim. That's why high level recruiters and HR execs at these four tech giants have openly discussed what it takes to snag a job at their respective companies.
 Microsoft
 The tech company employs approximately 73,000 people in the U.S. and over 125,000 people worldwide, so it's safe to say Microsoft receives a ton of applications.
 The company's head of global talent acquisition Chuck Edward tells CNBC Make It that candidates should do three things to stand out from the competition: Show that you have a career mindset, demonstrate a customer obsession and prove that you're a learner.
Edward adds that your resume should also describe your past leadership experience and how you have ""achieved results, progressed and learned."" Why? Because Microsoft favors applicants who ""embrace the future,"" says the HR exec.

 Facebook
 As the social media giant continues to grow so have the number of applicants. One former employee says he went through 17 rounds of interviews before finally snagging a role at the company.
In an interview with job site  Glassdoor, Facebook's vice president of people Lori Goler says applicants should do three things to secure a coveted position: Research the company culture, be knowledgeable about projects Facebook is working on and show that you're both a builder and a learner.

 She also recommends taking the time to thoroughly read call transcripts and earnings articles for current insight on what's most important to the company. That way, you can speak eloquently about Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision for the company during job interviews.
But most importantly, says Goler, show how you can contribute to the organization's growth.
""We're always looking at something and thinking, 'That works pretty well, but it can be even better,"" she tells Glassdoor. ""What that means is that we are never done,""
 IBM
 IBM takes a unique approach to hiring, vice president of talent Joanna Daly tells CNBC Make It. As the tech industry deals with the ongoing shortage of workers, IBM is now focusing on skill-based hiring rather than education level and four-year degrees.
IBM's CEO Ginni Rometty refers to these types of employees as ""new collar"" hires. One of those new collar hires is Sean Davis, a security engineer for IBM's cybersecurity business.
He tells CNBC Make It that his number one advice for other non-traditional candidates looking to edge their way into the company is to obtain ample hands-on experience.
""Always stay current on the industry and on new technology,"" says Davis. ""Always hone your craft.""
 Amazon
 The retail giant has held massive career fairs to fill open roles across its facilities. But even with this hiring frenzy, scoring a position at the company is no easy feat. In fact, the company continously ranks as one of the most sought-after employers.
If you want to score a position at the retailer, says Amazon's director of university recruiting Miriam Park, you should be focused on the customer and ""relentlessly curious.""
""We start working backwards from the customer,"" Park tells CNBC Make It, noting that this is a central theme throughout the company and is upheld by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
Curiosity is also important, says the HR recruiter, because Amazon continually explores new ideas and welcomes innovation from its employees.
Her No. 1 piece of advice to applicants is this: Focus on ""how you have owned a role and moved the needle forward, demonstrated curiosity and where you have solved a problem.""

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Facebook Inc., speaks during an event in Menlo Park, California.
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will stop levying fees on donations to charitable organizations made via its service, though fees on some personal fundraisers will remain.
 ""Now 100 percent of the money people donate on Facebook is going to go to the causes they care about,"" Zuckerberg said at the company's Social Good Forum in New York.
""This is something a lot of you talked to us about for a while,"" Zuckerberg told the crowd, suggesting the decision came after lobbying by multiple charities.
 While donations to both charitable groups and personal fundraisers in Europe, Australia and New Zealand are fee-free, the levy on the latter type of donation is 6.9 percent for U.S. users and 8.8 percent in Canada, according to Facebook's own donation guidelines.
The company also will create a $50 million annual fund to match charitable donations made on the social network, Zuckerberg said, and allow charities to access a ""fundraiser API,"" or piece of software that will let these groups access Facebook features easier.

 Google's YouTube is launching a new product called Reels that mirrors the ""stories"" format made popular by Snapchat and mimicked by Facebook and Instagram. 
 YouTube made the announcement as part of an expansion of its Community tools for popular video creators. A select group of YouTube content creators will be now be able to put together multiple mini-stories that give their fans a more personal or ""behind-the-scenes"" look aside from the videos they upload.
YouTube's Reels doesn't look exactly like Snapchat or Facebook's ""story"" products -- only creators with 10,000+ subscribers will be able to use the product whereas anyone can create Snapchat, Instagram, or Facebook stories.
 But the move underscores YouTube's continued attempt to become more social and community-oriented. Those efforts feel particularly urgent as rival Facebook has increasingly pushed its own video product to users. While YouTube was once the only obvious place for burgeoning video stars to make their mark, Facebook's wide reach and willingness to invest in content has the social networking site into an attractive video platform.
YouTube parent company Google has long struggled with social networking in general: Its main foray into the space, Google Plus, ended up getting dismantled and built back up several times. 
Reels will appear on the Community tab of a creator's YouTube page. 
Here's what an early version of the product will look like for Creators:

 });Mark Zuckerberg is the ultimate success story. He's built one of the most powerful technology platforms in the world and at 33 years old, he is worth more than $70 billion, according to Forbes.
 Tuesday, speaking from New York at the Facebook Social Good Forum, the billionaire revealed one of his favorite sayings — and it shows a lot about the way the entrepreneur operates.
""One of my favorite sayings is that there are two kinds of people in the world: optimists and pessimists. And the saying goes that optimists tend to be successful and pessimists tend to be right,"" says Zuckerberg, dressed, of course, in a grey T-shirt and jeans, addressing a roomful of 300 community members and nonprofits.
 ""And the idea is that if you think something is going to be terrible and it is going to fail, then you are going to look for the data points that prove you right and you will find them. That is what pessimists do,"" says Zuckerberg, according to a live stream on Zuckerberg's Facebook page.
 ""But if you think that something is possible, then you are going to try to find a way to make it work. And even when you make mistakes along the way and even when people doubt you, you are going to keep pushing until you find a way to make it happen,"" he says.

 });
 Indeed, that dogged pursuit of the possible, against all odds, is what makes an entrepreneur.
And it is the pursuit of what is possible that fundamentally drives Zuckerberg, according to a conversation the Facebook founder had with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman earlier in 2017.
""I am much more motivated by making sure we have the biggest impact on the world than by building a business or making sure we don't fail,"" Zuckerberg says to Hoffman. ""I have more fear in my life that we aren't going to maximize the opportunity that we have than that we mess something up and the business goes badly.""
 ""[O]ptimists tend to be successful and pessimists tend to be right.""
-Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook
 He's also voiced support for universal basic income, or cash handouts, professing an optimistic belief that if everyone were able to pay their bills, then more humans would be actively chasing their dreams. 
""Right now, when there are all these people who don't have the opportunity to go pursue their dreams or go build a new business, we all lose,"" according to Zuckerberg on a Facebook live this summer. ""If you who are watching this had more opportunity to go build something that would be a historic business or enterprise that could serve people all around the world, that would improve the economy and give services to all of us that we could all benefit from.""
Showing even more optimism, the billionaire got into a public debate with Elon Musk about the potential impact of artificial intelligence. 
Musk has repeatedly warned that artificial intelligence is a danger that needs to be feared and regulated. ""I have exposure to the most cutting edge AI, and I think people should be really concerned by it,"" according to Musk. ""AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilization.""
Zuckerberg, however, focuses on the potential benefit of artificial intelligence.
""I have pretty strong opinions on this. I am optimistic,"" says Zuckerberg. ""I think you can build things and the world gets better. But with AI especially, I am really optimistic. And I think people who are naysayers and try to drum up these doomsday scenarios — I just, I don't understand it. It's really negative and in some ways I actually think it is pretty irresponsible.""
""In the next five to 10 years, AI is going to deliver so many improvements in the quality of our lives,"" adds Zuckerberg.

 He's up with the sun
""No matter where I am, I rise early — usually around 5:00 a.m.,"" says Branson, who likes to sleep with his curtains open so the sunlight wakes him up. ""I find natural light to be wonderfully motivating. It's hard not to be enthusiastic about the day ahead with the sun streaming through the windows.""

 He's in good company: Tim Cook, Sallie Krawcheck and other highly successful individuals like to start the day before the average person.
He exercises
Branson knocks out his workout right away, preferring to play tennis. ""If tennis isn't an option, then I'll go for a walk or a run, or jump on my bike,"" he writes. ""If I'm near the ocean, and there's enough wind, I'll go for a kitesurf.""
Exercise, he claims, boosts his productivity significantly.
For breakfast, Branson opts for something high in fiber, ""like muesli and fruit,"" and gets his caffeine fix with tea. He and his wife Joan then check in with family. ""Exercise and family time put me in a great mind frame before getting down to business,"" the Virgin founder says.

And he always has a cup of tea within reach: ""To keep me energized, I drink lots of tea. I'm talking 20 cups a day.""
He eats dinner with friends and family
Group dinners are ""where stories are shared and ideas are born,"" Branson writes. Just in case, he always has a notebook with him. In fact, he credits some of his most successful companies to the simple habit of jotting down ideas.
He goes to bed around 11:00 p.m. ""I need around six hours [of] sleep [to] do it all again — a little differently — the next day,"" he says.

 Why Facebook ads follow you   
 8:17  PM ET Fri,  1 Dec 2017 |  02:10 
 It's happened time and time again. You've just been looking at a product on your phone, you open Facebook on your computer, it shows you an ad for that exact same product. 
Ad targeting from Facebook is so eerily accurate, people have  begun to believe that Facebook is somehow listening to them through their phone. But Facebook has said time and time again it does not use microphones on people's phones to listen to conversations.
 So what's really going on?
Let's look at this real scenario that happened to an editor at CNBC. He was looking at a furniture retailer's website for bed frames on his iPad, and mentioned it out loud to his wife. His wife opened her computer and went to Facebook, where she saw an ad for that specific furniture retailer. 
We talked to several sources who are familiar with Facebook's advertising technology to see how this could have happened. Here are several possibilites.
1. The furniture retailer asked its ad be shown to a certain demographic, and she fit the bill. 
Businesses can show Facebook ads to people within certain parameters. This targeting can get pretty specific, down to a 1 mile radius of an address. Facebook is also testing household targeting, meaning some advertisers have the option to reach family members in addition to the initial target customer. 
The methods are ""completely compliant"" with the law, said Havas Media's agency Socialyse executive vice president and managing director of North America Jess Richards. 
""It allows advertisers, if they are doing it right, to be more relevant based on the information they know,"" she said. 
So, let's say the editor's wife listed herself as a female, her birthdate and the city she lives in on her Facebook profile. The furniture retailer was looking to show an ad to women in her age group in the New York metro area, and showed her the ad. The fact that her husband had just been talking about it was coincidental.
It could also be the furniture retailer intended to target someone who fit the description of her husband, and she was simply part of the householding targeting test. She would also receive the ad. 
2. She showed interest in the subject matter by her activity on or off Facebook. 
Facebook knows what you like and post on its platform. From that, it determines what ads it thinks you'll like. 
But it can also figure out what other sites you browse as long as you remain logged in on that device. It does this courtesy of tiny pixels publishers and businesses embed in their websites. These dots send a message back to Facebook when you visit -- the technology is called Facebook Pixel. It allows companies to target people based on other sites they previously looked at.
You can see which sites have Facebook Pixels using the company's Chrome extension.
 DigitasLBi vice president and group director of paid social Jeanne Bright gives an example.
Say a person was looking at jackets on Nordstrom from their mobile phone while they were logged into the Facebook app. Then they open their computer to Facebook and sees ad from Nordstrom.
""They are able to get a ping if I'm logged into Facebook that I opened a new tab in a my browser, and see I was browsing for a jacket,"" explained Bright. ""Nordstrom now 'knows' through anonymized data I was looking at jackets, and serves (everyone who had looked on their site for jackets) an ad.""
In this case, the editor's wife may have visited that same furniture retailer's website at an earlier date, or visited other similar websites, while she was logged in to Facebook. She may have also liked the retailer or other furniture pages on Facebook. The business knows she's looking for furniture, so they serve her an ad. 
3. The furniture company specifically targeted her.
Facebook allows companies to upload email lists of specific users they want to see their ads. Businesses usually use this to re-target customers who had previously purchased items. 
They could also know a customer's Facebook ID if they used that same email to log into the furniture retailer, or used Facebook directly to log into that site. Or, someone the household could be on the company's list, and that company may choose to serve its ads to everyone in the household. 
Havas' Richards said targeting ""coming from a single data point like email"" is one of the most plausible reasons why the editor's wife saw the ad. 
Here the editor may have logged into the retailer's website using the same email he uses for his Facebook account. The company uploaded his email into Facebook and told Facebook to show the ad to everybody in his household.
4. He used her device to look at the product. 
Many households share devices, whether it's using the computer that is closest to you or watching on the same digital media player like a Roku or Apple TV. If people remain logged into Facebook on that device, the company has access to multiple people's browsing history. Facebook is also excellent at tracking behavior across devices, since people use the same log-in on different devices. 
So let's say the editor had previously used his wife's computer to look at the bed frames. If his wife had never signed out of her Facebook account, Facebook thinks she was looking at the bed frames web site, then serves this ad on her computer the because it thinks she's interested in the company.
Or, perhaps the husband's iPad was logged into the wife's Facebook account when he was looking at the bed frames. Facebook would assume she was the one looking, and show her the relevant ad on other devices where she was logged in -- in this case, on her computer.
5. The furniture company worked with a third-party data provider to find their ideal customer, and she is it. 
Advertisers sometimes work with third-party marketing services like Axiom, Datalogic or Epsilon to find the right customer. These companies use a variety of data sources like credit card information and other consumer behavior, and provide information that can be integrated with Facebook or any other advertising platform to target someone. 
""Let's say we want to reach someone who is a high grocery purchaser,"" Bright explained. ""Axiom gets data from grocery store loyalty numbers, matches that to an individual and passes that hashed information to Facebook.""
Third-party data collectors focused on 360-degree connectivity may also be able to connect behavior on multiple devices that share email logins. If you use the same email to log into your internet provider and Facebook, they may be able to collect information on your shopping habits across devices. 
That third-party information can also be used to target households. Facebook accounts have enough information through relationship statuses, pictures and interactions to determine who lives in the same household. (The advertisers don't get access to this invidualized information.)
In this scenario, the furniture retailer might have hired a third-party company to find anyone who is a new homeowner, since those people are likely to need furniture. It just so happened the editor and his wife had recently bought a new house. Their names could have been anonymized and put on an advertiser's list that was uploaded to Facebook. Facebook served everyone on that list an ad, and she saw it.
Or maybe it's just a weird coincidence
We are shown hundreds of ads a day, most of which we gloss over. It could just be fate that an ad showed up while they were talking about the company. 
""The fact you talked about it makes you more likely to notice it,"" Bright said. ""People are seeing hundreds of advertisements a day, but they aren't noticing what all of them are for."" 
None of these methods are unique to Facebook, Bright pointed out. 
""The things that Facebook does is pretty common to other digital advertisers,"" she said. ""Everything we talked about, Google does it too."" 
If you're still freaked out, you can see why you are shown any sponsored post on Facebook by clicking on the three dots on the upper right hand corner, and selecting the ""Why am I seeing this ad?"" option. It doesn't always give exact details, but you can see what it tells you and figure out pretty quickly what makes sense.
For instance, in this screenshot, Facebook says it's showing me a BarkBox ad because I use the same email address to log into BarkBox that I use on Facebook. BarkBox wants to reach me specifically on Facebook (example 3 above) and so it targets an ad to me using that email address.

 });Two friends started a greeting card company on the internet. It was cheap to launch and it instantly reached millions. Then one day without warning, Facebook changed the way it did business.
This is a story about survival in the age of Facebook, when a privately held algorithm can turn a beloved product into a hobby with no monetary value. Subplots include forays into alcohol, cheap laughs, and low-paid freelancers.
Duncan Mitchell was a creative director at an ad agency in 2005 when his friend Brook Lundy, who worked at another agency, approached him with the idea to create online greeting cards. The ones available at the time seemed staid or unfunny. More salient, an e-card company, Blue Mountain, had recently been  bought for stock and cash worth up to $1 billion.

""In the back of your head, especially back then, you're like, Is this the next million dollar idea?"" Mr. Mitchell, 48, said.

 });
 Mr. Mitchell was a graphic designer; Mr. Lundy had a way with words. At the very least, they thought, they could create cards for their friends.
""And at the very best we could leave our advertising jobs,"" Mr. Lundy, 46, said. ""That was the ambitious side of us, that we could figure out this business that we knew nothing about."" Their product, they thought, was tailor-made for the social network of Facebook: fast, funny and intensely shareable.
What happened next, as the cards thrived and then suddenly withered on Facebook, illustrates the mercurial power of a new near-monopoly, with implications for all sorts of publishers and businesses, said Jonathan Zittrain, director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University.

 How this 33-year-old turned $200 into $1 million in 92 days   
 4:07  PM ET Tue, 30 May 2017 |  02:04 
 ""Facebook has grown at a pace and had an impact that it's really hard to say anybody planned,"" he said. ""It isn't just a mere commercial platform. It's a place that people are turning to to get their sense of what's going on in the world.
""That's a combination that should be carefully navigated,"" Mr. Zittrain said. ""It would be awfully strange, back in the day, if the Yellow Pages rearranged themselves every other day.""
On a recent morning in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Lundy and five staff members gathered to discuss the state of traffic on Someecards.com. The offices were a kicky corporate WeWork space near Wall Street; the staff were mostly standup comedians and joke writers, mostly in their 30s.
""There's good news,"" said May Wilkerson, an editor on the site. ""We're at 18 million sessions for the month so far, up from 16.7 million at this point last month.""
What was drawing those users, though, was not e-cards but a stream of articles about things that were popular on the internet at that moment, including a celebrity's new ""boob tattoo"" and a dermatologist who called herself Dr. Pimple Popper, with a 15-minute video of a ""never ending"" cyst doing — well, you can imagine what it was doing.
More than half a million people watched the video.
""Old reliable,"" said Orli Matlow, one of the writers, noting that this was not the first time the company had posted videos from Dr. Pimple Popper.
Two writers in the room said they were physically repelled by the video. All agreed this was a good thing.
These hourly blog posts have replaced e-cards as the company's main source of revenue. How long that will last before the company has to reinvent itself again is anyone's guess.

 For a humor company, the office was short on banter. The staff communicated mainly through Slack, the messaging app. WeWork, with its cold brew iced coffee on tap, supplied a fun-ish workplace with no personal design touches, and Slack enabled camaraderie without actual discussions.
When the two friends started the company in 2007, with $350,000 in seed money, their plan was to produce e-cards, build a following and possibly sell to a larger company.
The first two steps came quickly. Using stock line drawings found on the internet, they wrote wry texts — an early favorite was, ""When work feels overwhelming, remember that you're going to die"" — and posted them on Facebook. When people clicked on a card, it sent them to the company website, which contained paid advertising. Within a year, the site was drawing 1.5 million visitors a month. The founders hired more writers. Traffic to the site reached 5 million visitors a month.
Then four years ago, something changed. Cards that might once have reached 200,000 people were suddenly reaching only a few hundred, Mr. Mitchell said.
By then, Facebook had become the equivalent of television in the 1960s, said Nicole Ames, who runs a digital marketing firm called Twist IMC. ""It's the biggest dog on the porch,"" she said. But for the companies that grew there, she said, it was impossible to know what formula it used to determine which posts appeared in users' news feeds. When Facebook cut down on images that directed users to other sites, companies like Someecards were blindsided.
""You spent years building up this organic following, and now your content no longer shows up unless you pay,"" Ms. Ames said. ""I tell clients all the time, you play in Facebook's playpen, and if they change something, it's their game, it's their rules.""
Although e-cards remain popular, they now mostly provide an identity for the company, distinguishing it from other internet humor sites, Mr. Mitchell said. Freelancers submit texts for cards, and earn $25 for each one chosen.
""Twelve million people can look at them on Facebook, but we don't make any money from that,"" Mr. Mitchell said. The company tried to sell the cards for a while, but there was not enough interest.

 7:24  PM ET Wed,  5 April 2017 |  01:40 
 Instead, the staff uses the Someecards style to create branded advertising for Showtime, Splenda and other clients, relying on Facebook shares.
""If we can make you happy enough to share it with your friends, then your friends will be advertised to, and you'll be advertising,"" Mr. Mitchell said. ""Facebook's algorithm plays to that too. If we post this and people don't like it, it goes away. We need you to share.""
Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Lundy are now trying to plan for the next time Facebook changes its rules. One idea rolled out last year was a line of wines called  SomeWine, with labels resembling the cards. An inexpensive red blend, for example, is labeled ""This wine goes great with more of this wine.""
Mr. Lundy said he had given up worrying about the uncertainty, because there was nothing he could do about it. But Mr. Mitchell pointed to a recent experiment in six countries, where Facebook stopped including posts from publishers in users' news feeds, relegating them to a separate feed. Companies lost most of their readership overnight, Mr. Mitchell said.
""Google and Facebook have so much power,"" Mr. Mitchell said. ""When they make these changes you have to be ready and have ideas. There could be a day where we're out of ideas. Hasn't happened yet. So I worry about it. I try to keep that concern in that place that doesn't paralyze you, but keeps you motivated to keep doing new things.""
In the meantime, the company survives by Facebook's algorithms and the tastes of the American public, which turns out to favor a vivid dermatology video.
""I've had friends complain,"" Mr. Mitchell admitted. ""And I don't look at Dr. Pimple Popper. But all I can say is, the way Facebook works, if you people out there weren't clicking on Dr. Pimple Popper, it wouldn't be there.""
This, he said, is a winning formula, at least for now.
""Somebody is watching that stuff, and a lot of people are watching it,"" he said. ""So that's that.""

 It's been a tough week for the FAANG stocks — though a few bounced back today. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet are all down for the week, anywhere from roughly 1 percent to 4 percent.
 That doesn't sound like much, but when you're dealing with this group, you're in the biggest league of them all in terms of market capitalization. When they move, they move indexes, and they can make, and lose, a lot of money for investors. Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon were four of the five biggest negative drags on the S&P 500 this week.
Let me show you what I'm talking about. Collectively, the five FAANG stocks had a market capitalization of about $2.8 trillion at the end of last week. The entire value of the U.S. stock market was about $28 trillion, meaning the FAANG stocks were about 10 percent of the market cap of the entire stock market.
 FAANG vs. the market (market capitalization)
FAANG stocks: $2.8 trillion
U.S. market capitalization $28 trillion
But this week the total market value of the FAANG stocks dropped to about $2.75 trillion, a loss of about $60 billion in market cap. Facebook and Apple alone are down about $17 billion each, followed by Google at nearly $15 billion, and Amazon and Netflix with smaller declines.

Facebook $17.8 billion
Apple $17.7 billion
Google $14.7 billion
Amazon $6.6 billion
Netflix $3.1 billion
Total: $60.0 billion
The good news is that this group stabilized on Thursday. And for the year, they are all up, as much as 56 percent for Amazon and 32 percent for Alphabet. Four have at least doubled and in some cases tripled the S&P 500's 18 percent gain. It will be interesting to see  how much longer can that continue, even with outsized revenue growth.

 Famed tech investor says Facebook is your best tech bet   
 5:51  PM ET Thu, 30 Nov 2017 |  04:57 
 Don't panic: this isn't a tech selloff, according to famed tech investor Dan Niles.
 Niles, founding partner of AlphaOne Capital Partners, also recommended taking advantage of temporarily dragging FAANG stocks to invest in Facebook. 
""Let's be realistic, this isn't much of a selloff,"" Niles said Thursday on CNBC's ""Fast Money."" ""These stocks are all down a few percentage points, and I think it speaks to the fact that we haven't had a real selloff since January 2016.""
 Stocks of the FAANG companies -- Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent company Alphabet -- all dropped roughly 1 to 4 percent this week for a combined market cap loss of about $60 billion. What's more, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet marked four of the five biggest drags on the S&P 500.
Despite the combined losses, Niles still recommended buying Facebook, citing the social media giant's double-digit earnings and revenue gains, among other metrics.
""There's a big difference between an Amazon at single digit operating margins, and a Facebook at 50 percent operating margins, or a Netflix that has negative 3 cash flow for the next couple years,"" Niles said.
""From a standpoint of risk and reward, it's one that we really like,"" he added. 
And while he maintains his confidence in big tech, Niles does think the market will start getting more competitive for tech companies. As big tech continues to crowd the market, he foresees semiconductors and internet names struggling.
""I think other areas of tech are likely to struggle,"" Niles said. ""But I do still think there are still some really good buys within technology.""

94,2017-12-01,"Netflix and Facebook among JPMorgan’s favorite internet stock ideas for 2018  You know that new 'Watch' video tab on Facebook? Here's how the company will make money off it, analyst says  Facebook could start putting ads at the beginning of some videos, report says  Here's why that Facebook ad is following you and your family  ","Mike Blake | Reuters
Comic con fans gather at the Netflix booth at Comic Con International in San Diego, California, July 19, 2017.
 Internet stocks have crushed the market this year and one top Wall Street firm believes the sector can go even higher next year.
 JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth shared his top internet stock ideas in a note to clients Friday.
""Heading into 2018, we expect fundamentals to remain strong in online advertising & eCommerce, with both growing at least in the mid-teens,"" he wrote in the report. ""We are cautiously optimistic, as secular growth & underlying fundamentals should continue to drive strong growth.""
 The average internet stock in JPMorgan's coverage universe has risen 37 percent year to date compared to the S&P 500's 18 percent gain through Thursday.
Here are the analyst's two favorite overweight-rated stock ideas along with his current price targets.
1) Netflix (NFLX)
Anmuth has a $242 Dec. 2018 price target for Netflix shares, representing 29 percent upside to Thursday's close.
""Netflix continues to be our top growth pick into 2018, as we believe NFLX has considerable room to increase its sub base [and its] shares are less well owned relative to the other FANG names,"" he wrote. ""We believe Netflix will continue to drive and benefit from the ongoing disruption of linear TV, supported by an ever-expanding base of high quality original content.""
He predicts Netflix will double its subscriber base to nearly 200 million by 2021.
2) Facebook (FB)
The analyst has a $225 Dec. 2018 price target for Facebook shares, representing 27 percent upside to Thursday's close.
""FB continued to deliver strong ad revenue growth, earnings beats, and significant number revisions in 2017,"" Anmuth wrote. ""We are positive on FB into 2018 … We believe valuation of Facebook shares is compelling at ~21x our 2019 GAAP EPS.""
He is optimistic Facebook has ""significant headroom"" to grow Instagram's 800 million monthly users and monetize the platform.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook users spend upwards of 50 minutes a day on the platform — and as long as at least 7 of those are in the new video tab, it's a good deal for the company, one analyst says. 
 Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak estimates that Facebook will make $565 million in revenue from the ""Watch"" tab video in 2018, on video spending of $400 million. About $200 million of the spending would be on producing content Nowak wrote in a note released on Friday. 
That implies that each daily user in North American would spend about 20 minutes a day on the ""Watch"" tab videos.  The users would only need to watch about 7 minutes of video for Facebook to break even on its $200 million content investment, Nowak wrote.
 According to Nowak's estimates and Neilsen data, users watch 40 minutes per day on YouTube (global average), 125 minutes a day on Netflix (U.S. average) and 260 minutes a day of traditional TV (U.S. average). 
Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at Facebook's F8 Developer Conference on April 18, 2017 at McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California.
 Facebook might be experimenting with a new ad format, according to a report in Ad Age, amid jitters about the company's advertising growth and swelling costs.
 Facebook plans to test so-called pre-roll ads at the beginning of ""Watch"" tab videos, a shift from the mid-roll ads that appear in the middle of videos now, according to Ad Age, citing advertisers familiar with Facebook's strategy.
While pre-roll ads are common on services like Hulu and YouTube, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that Facebook users are different. Ad Age noted Zuckerberg's comments from earlier this year: ""[O]ur model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content, you come to look at a feed."" 
 But Facebook has started to focus more heavily on posting serial content on its ""Watch"" video tab, which may draw more loyal watchers, Ad Age reported. Facebook declined to comment. 
It's important that Facebook find new ways to monetize its business since the company has warned that it's reaching the maximum number of ads it can fit on the page. Facebook has also pledged to make a huge investment in content security staff.
In a Friday note released before AdAge's report, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak predicted that Facebook will make $565 million in revenue from the ""Watch"" tab video in 2018,  on video spending of $400 million.

 His daughters Max and August were born in 2015 and 2017, respectively. 
 This summer, shortly after August was born, Zuckerberg said he would take his paternity leave broken up into two blocks: immediately, and then again in December.
Though Zuckerberg, who is currently worth almost $70 billion according to Forbes, could certainly afford to take the time off regardless of Facebook's paid leave policy, as CEO, he sets the tone for the company.

 ""At Facebook, we offer four months of maternity and paternity leave because studies show that when working parents take time to be with their newborns, it's good for the entire family. And I'm pretty sure the office will still be standing when I get back,"" Zuckerberg said in August.
 In addition to four months of paid leave for parents, Facebook also offers more than 40 private nursing rooms, educational sessions for new families and fertility services, according to an email from Facebook to CNBC Make It. 
However not all employees in America are so lucky. The United States federal government does not legally require paid parental leave. That puts the country behind Estonia, Croatia, Korea, Mexico, Cyprus and dozens of other developed nations,  according to data compiled by the Pew Research Center.

Facebook's new office in London.

 The move will take the social media giant's total employee presence in Britain to 2,300. The London office will be Facebook's largest engineering hub outside the U.S.
Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook's Europe, Middle East and Asia vice-president, praised the U.K. as a tech company base.
 ""The U.K.'s flourishing entrepreneurial ecosystem and international reputation for engineering excellence makes it one of the best places in the world to build a tech company,"" she said.
Mendelsohn added that the decision indicated Facebook was ""more committed than ever to the U.K.""

 Facebook announces new Messenger app for kids   
 8:54  AM ET Mon,  4 Dec 2017 |  01:12 
 Facebook is launching a kids messaging app that gives parents control over who can chat with their children.
 Messenger Kids links to a parent's Facebook account and grants parental approval for chat and video call contacts, the company announced Monday. 
Kids open the app to a pre-approved list of friends and relatives and can launch one-on-one or group chats. 
 ""Whether it's using video chat to talk to grandparents, staying in touch with cousins who live far away, or sending mom a decorated photo while she's working late to say hi, Messenger Kids opens up a new world of online communication to families,"" the company said in a statement. 
The app features a narrower, kid-friendly library of GIFs and facial filters. It's available for the iPad, iPod touch and iPhone. Parents oversee their child's contact list through the Facebook app.
Facebook said Messenger Kids is ad-free and won't use your child's information for ads.

As part of this, many men are looking inward, wondering how they can stop being part of the problem.
 But according to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, there could be an unintended consequence of public conversation, and it could spell bad news for women.
""The percentage of men who will be afraid to be alone with a female colleague has to be sky high right now,"" Sandberg writes.
 Isolating women would have many negative impacts, most tangibly, that women would lose out on mentorship and sponsorship opportunities. This could exacerbate existing problems, such as the fact that women are already  less likely to be promoted than men. They're also more likely to be underpaid.
There's a simple solution, however, according to the Facebook executive.

 });
 ""Whether that means you take all your direct reports out to dinner or none of them,"" Sandberg writes, ""the key is to give men and women equal opportunities to succeed.""
""Doing right by women in the workplace does not just mean treating them with respect. It also means not isolating or ignoring them — and making access equal,"" the COO adds.
Leaving women out of important meetings or conversations, Sandberg says, would be a step in the wrong direction.

Sallie Krawcheck, who founded the investing company Ellevest, says that this leadership gap also affects businesses' bottom lines.
In a New York Times op-ed, she writes, ""Despite research showing that companies with more diversity, and particularly more women in leadership, offer  higher returns on capital,  lower risk and  greater innovation than firms without such leadership, Wall Street has been, and is, predominantly male at the top.""
Fixing the way women are treated at work, Sandberg says, is better for everyone. 
In response to the post, Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckberg expressed his support, writing, ""This is so important and I know the advice to establish clear principles and policies will help improve many organizations.""

 Thing you knew but should keep thinking about anyway: The big tech companies are very interested in streaming live sports to you.
Today's reminder comes from Facebook, which wants to hire an exec to negotiate sports rights deals. The company has been interviewing candidates for a while, says  Sports Business Journal's John Ourand.
More interesting: Ourand's sources say whoever gets the job will have a budget of a ""few billion dollars"" to spend on global rights deal. No comment from Facebook comms on his story, but John is a very good reporter, so let's assume the number is correct until we hear otherwise.

 Mark Cuban: NBA rights fees to 'skyrocket' because live content still hard to create   
 2:51  PM ET Thu,  9 Nov 2017 |  01:25 
 In 2014, for instance, DirecTV agreed to pay the NFL a  reported $1.5 billion a year for the rights to its ""Sunday Ticket"" ticket package. (That deal is up in 2022, by the way.) ESPN and Turner are paying the NBA a  reported $2.66 billion a year for their current deal.
So: Unless the value of TV sports rights deals dramatically craters in the near future, Facebook won't be buying any exclusive rights to any big-ticket sports anytime soon.
On the other hand, a ""few billion dollars"" could definitely go a long way when it comes to streaming-only deals, sold alongside traditional TV deals. That's what the NFL has been doing with its Thursday night games for the last couple years: Last year, it sold the digital rights to Twitter for about $10 million; this year Amazon got them for about $50 million.
And  Facebook itself just bid $600 million — $120 million a year for five years — to stream cricket matches in India. It didn't get the deal — Star paid $2.6 billion for a combined TV-digital deal — but it was a good sign that Facebook is willing to spend significant money for sports. And now we have another.

 The Washington, D.C.-based firm is instead looking to industrial opportunities, and hopes to land the next generation's Foxconn, Dow Chemical or Cree Lighting.
Anzu Partners' Whitney Haring-Smith, who co-founded the firm with David Michael and David Seldin, told CNBC, ""We plan to invest in private companies with breakthroughs in the M's -- materials, manufacturing, measuring, monitoring and modeling. Companies in these industries would probably never become a household brand name. But they impact everything in and around the house from your car to the items in your kitchen or medicine cabinet.""
 The firm has been investing under-the-radar in a mix of venture and private equity deals since 2014, but had not raised a large fund of pooled capital for deals until this year. Its portfolio includes: Nuburu, a maker of high-powered blue lasers used for precision welding in aerospace and electronics; SLIPS Technologies, which makes super slippery coatings used to keep industrial equipment clean; and OTI Lumionics, a maker of OLED materials that go into high-definition displays.
Previously Anzu set up ""special purpose vehicles,"" drawing together a mix of family offices and high-net worth individuals to back early-stage start-ups or to take divestitures (a.k.a. spin-outs) from Fortune 500 companies.
Now that Anzu Partners has more dry powder for equity deals, the firm will be adding personnel and advisors with a highly technical background to scout deals, including from top universities in the U.S. and Canada. 
""We're more likely to hire a chemical engineer than an MBA,"" Haring-Smith said.

 Netflix, Apple and Facebook won't go much lower   
 8:08  PM ET Tue,  5 Dec 2017 |  00:51 
 After a brutal rotation out of the technology stocks that came on the heels of the Senate passing its tax reform bill, CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to check in with tech.
 Tech stocks recovered on Tuesday after Monday's storm of selling, caused in part by investors trying to buy shares of domestic companies that stand to benefit from corporate tax reform.
So Cramer called on technician Carolyn Boroden, one of his colleagues at RealMoney.com and the brain behind FibonacciQueen.com, to help him get a better outlook on the tech sector.
 ""Specifically, we're going to drill down into the action in the now-despised and left-for-dead roadkill that are Facebook, Apple and Netflix,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The big question: when we look back on this moment a year from now, will the pullbacks in these stocks look like fabulous buying opportunities?""
Boroden's methodology for predicting these moves might seem obvious. She uses ratios developed by medieval mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, who discovered that certain patterns repeat themselves in nature in things like snail shells and pine cones.
Funny enough, these patterns also tend to show up in the stock charts. The Fibonacci Queen's specialty is looking at past swings in a given stock or index and applying the ratios to find when a stock might change trajectory.
""I know it sounds like pseudo-science, a kind of stock market astrology or alchemy, but the fact is, it does work,"" Cramer said.
And when it comes to the stocks of Netflix, Apple and Facebook, Boroden found that all three recently reached key Fibonacci extensions of their prior swings.
In plain English, that means the stocks repeated an entire previous move, then ran up some more, which Boroden often takes as a sign to get more cautious.
Looking at the weekly chart of Netflix, Boroden liked that the stock's latest pullback was very similar to its last few declines.
 Netflix's stock lost roughly $27 in its last pullback in late summer. In the pullback before that, it also shed about $27. Last week, it lost $26, meaning the most recent decline could be over.
Better yet, the $27 declines were followed by much bigger rallies that made up for the declines and then some. While that might not necessarily happen again, Boroden was confident that if Netflix's $177 to $178 floor of support holds, the stock could run to $211 a share.
""However, if Netflix does start falling again and breaks down below the floor of support, the next one is at $167 to $168 — that's the level to watch if the big tech sell-off picks up again,"" Cramer said.
Just like with Netflix, Apple's weekly chart suggests the stock is experiencing a ""garden-variety pullback,"" Cramer said.
 Apple's last few pullbacks each lasted for about $14, meaning the now-$170 stock could decline to $160. But the stock has so many floors of support between $170 and $160 that Boroden isn't worried.
""There's the floor at $166 to $167, another floor at $164 and $165, and there's one at $159 to $161,"" Cramer said. ""That's a lot of areas where things could turn again, and the stock's rallied slightly today so it's possible that the pain is already over.""
Like the others, Facebook's last few pullbacks of $10 or $11 suggested that the stock's current decline — down over $10 from where it traded a week ago — might be done after today's rally.
 That said, Boroden did point out some levels to watch for Facebook: one floor of support from $169 to $170, another from $162 to $166, and a third at $157.
""As long as the price holds above one of these floors, even the lowest one, Boroden's optimistic,"" Cramer said.
All in all, Fibonacci ratios, especially when imparted on stocks by the Fibonacci Queen, can be so predictive that they're ""almost creepy,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""The charts, as interpreted by Carolyn Boroden, suggest that the recent declines in Netflix, in Apple and in Facebook are really nothing to get too worked up about,"" he concluded. ""My view? These tech titans may not be in the sweet spot to benefit the most from tax reform, but they're still fabulous companies. I'd use any further weakness to gradually buy some more on the way down, even as they've been thrown away as if they were never worth anything to begin with.""

 You're wrong if you think tech stocks are too expensive   
 8:13  PM ET Tue,  5 Dec 2017 |  00:58 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer knows how hard it is to compare stocks using their individual valuations.
 The only tools investors really have to value a stock are the given company's total addressable market and its price-to-earnings multiple, or the share price relative to the earnings per share.
""In the end, valuing stocks is either totally straightforward or totally mystifying — one or the other,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""For a certain group of stocks, it's much more of an art than a science.""
 For example, investors trying to pin down the value of Netflix will run into trouble because the streaming giant barely has any earnings, Cramer said.
""You're hostage to the total addressable market, or TAM, for internet entertainment around the world,"" he explained. ""Without that kind of thinking, no one would ever believe it was reasonable for Netflix the company to be worth almost four times as much as CBS.""
Valuing Amazon is just as tricky. Cramer thinks Amazon's retail and cloud businesses could be worth $750 billion and $250 billion respectively, which would mean the $1,140 stock could still double.
If investors considered that possibility, the recent technology stock sell-off would make shares of Amazon seem like a bargain over the long term.
How about Tesla? It's no secret that Cramer thinks the automaker's value is entirely in the eye of the beholder considering its lack of earnings, shoddy projections and star power of its CEO, Elon Musk.
But for those who view Tesla as a tech stock and not an auto stock, the $303 share price seems reasonable, Cramer said.
To prove his point, Cramer pointed to the valuations of respected consumer goods stocks like Colgate and Clorox. Colgate has a 7 percent growth rate and a 24 times price-to-earnings multiple; Clorox also trades at 24 times next year's earnings and has a growth rate of 5 percent.
""We all accept these valuations in the consumer packaged goods space despite uninspiring growth rates and now-meager dividends,"" Cramer said. ""It's stereotyping, plain and simple.""
Meanwhile, stocks like Apple, Alphabet and Facebook are viewed as too expensive despite having larger addressable markets and faster growth than the consumer goods names, he said.
Apple's growth rate, for one, could go as high as 25 percent by some estimates. Still, the tech stock has a price-to-earnings multiple of 14, a huge discount to the consumer goods names.
Similarly, analysts put Facebook's growth rate at 21 percent with a 21 times price-to-earnings estimate for 2019. Alphabet has a 17 percent growth rate and sells at 24 times 2018 earnings estimates.
All of this tells Cramer one thing: that the stocks he likes and owns for his charitable trust are cheaper, on a price-to-earnings basis, than household consumer goods names.
""People love to claim that Facebook or Alphabet or Apple have gotten so expensive that you can't possibly own them, but when you actually do the exercises I do and you get all arithmetic ... you don't get that conclusion,"" Cramer said. ""Yep, tech's much cheaper than you think. It just doesn't usually get explained in comparison to what's really expensive that we all hold so dear.""

 Pirated video streams of televised National Football League games are widespread on Facebook and on Google's YouTube service, CNBC has found.
 Using technology from these internet giants, thousands of football fans were able to watch long segments of many contests free of charge during the league's Week 13 schedule of games last Thursday and Sunday.
Dozens of these video streams, pirated from CBS and NBC broadcasts, featured ads from well-known national brands interspersed with game action.
 This online activity comes as the league struggles with declining ratings that have been blamed variously on player protests during the national anthem and revelations about former players suffering from a brain disease caused by concussions.
Yet this illegal distribution of NFL content may also be crimping the league's viewer numbers. 
The NFL strictly controls television and online video rights to its games. In particular, games played by teams that are not in a local TV market are often not televised except on DirecTV, and only for subscribers who pay extra for a package called ""Sunday Ticket."" That package starts at $55 per month.
If pirated versions of these games are available online users might ignore the DirecTV package, or skip locally televised games that they might otherwise watch. It also means that advertisers are reaching audience members that they did not pay for.
Facebook reportedly is prepared to spend more than $1 billion for the rights to future sports content, but as of now Amazon is the only large technology company with a streaming deal for football. It paid $50 million for the rights to stream 10 Thursday Night Football games this year.
 Almost-live whack-a-mole
 CNBC was able to find dozens of feeds on Facebook and YouTube (including duplicates of the same game) over the past week. Most were disabled by Facebook and YouTube after as little as 10 minutes, but some stayed online for 20 minutes or more -- long enough to attract thousands of viewers.
For the majority of games followed by CNBC (though not all) these pirated video feeds attracted more viewers on YouTube than on Facebook.
For example, with 10:32 left in the second quarter of Thursday night's game between the Washington Redskins and Dallas Cowboys, 6,986 people were watching a feed posted by a YouTube user named ""Kai sisir,"" according to the stream's counter.
Over on Facebook, meanwhile, a stream of the same game, posted by a user called ""Unlimited Stream NFL,"" had attracted some 2,000 viewers by the time it was shut down at 5:49 p.m. PT.
The following screen shots show some of the games that were available to watch this past Sunday.
 While many of these videos were uploaded to YouTube and Facebook via feeds with names such as ""Allsport live,"" ""HQ Live,"" ""Live Streaming NFL"" and ""Am_Football Live Anvivo,"" none were able to maintain a truly live feed. Rather, most videos trailed the action televised on the networks by at least a play or two.
And the viewing experience was far from seamless, with feeds shut down at times during an important play, as when YouTube shut down the one from Kai sisir just after Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins fumbled the ball with roughly 9:40 left in the second quarter.
Still, a determined online viewer willing to jump from one feed to another can watch long portions of games that otherwise would be unavailable in their region or require a subscription to the Sunday Ticket.
These pirated feeds were made easier to find thanks to the search software of both companies. Typing the letters ""nfl"" into the search box on either website prompted the software to suggest similar, related phrases such as ""nfl live streaming,"" for example.
Clicking on that search string then called up a list of video feeds for various games:
 YouTube also hosts several tutorial videos explaining how to watch the NFL for free.
To give one measure of the interest in these pirated streams, one posted two years ago by a user called WizzyIggy had been viewed 177,000 times as of Monday afternoon.
Facebook said via a spokesperson that it uses ""reference streams"" provided by video publishers and media companies to check for pirated content with a tool called Rights Manager.
""If a match surfaces, Rights Manager immediately takes action on the rule set by the rights holder -- for example, to block that stream,"" the Facebook spokesperson said in an email. ""We've been growing our global team that processes these reports across time zones and continue to invest in our copyright tools. This remains a work in progress,"" the email said.
An NFL spokesperson said the league was aware of the problem and have people whose full-time job is to track down illegal content and cases of piracy. YouTube did not return requests for comment.
 Like a digital sports speakeasy
 Uploading and hosting one of these feeds can turn ordinary Facebook or YouTube users into minor social media celebrities -- although the fame is fleeting.
A Facebook user named Johnny Garcia uploaded an almost-live video feed that drew 1,400 viewers, 60 comments and 8 shares on the website.
Like owners of a digital sports speakeasy, these video pirates warn viewers that the show will end soon and alert them where to go next to keep watching.
""Sorry for the lag, I will fix when my stream gets put down, I will re-upload,"" Garcia said in a comment stream that ran in the stream he uploaded.
Before it was taken down with 3:25 left in the first quarter, it had been on for at least 15 minutes, long enough to show ads from national brands like Bounty, Amazon and Sprint.
 A feed on YouTube uploaded by a user named ""girangerwoder235"" posted a message on it that said: ""We Can't Broadcast Here Because YouTube copyright Click Link in comment.""
It had 274 people watching when the feed was disabled.
The presence of ads -- and the quality of their feeds -- gave some pirate streams an air of legitimacy.
For example, the game between the Tennessee Titans and Houston Texans early Sunday contained a long break in play at the 10:40 mark of the second quarter as officials reviewed a 4-yard touchdown pass by Texans quarterback Tom Savage.
At that point, the CBS broadcast of the contest showed ads from Dodge, Verizon and Kay Jewelers, followed by promotional videos for the Carol Burnett 50th Anniversary Show and another for another show on the network called Man with a Plan.
A CNBC reporter watched them all on a feed called ""NFL Unoficcial LIVE,"" with a misspelling pointing to a possible overseas origin.
Still, viewers of these pirated games could be a demanding audience, with many comments complaining about the start-and-stop quality of the video.
""REALLY? just audio??"" wrote a Facebook user called Nitrous De Jesus Rodriguez, on a feed titled ""NFL Live HD.""

 Indian start-ups are looking to beat Facebook and Amazon in their own backyard   
 4:27  PM ET Wed,  6 Dec 2017 |  00:42 
 Many of India's top tech start-ups are establishing a lobbying group to push for governmental regulations to put an end to global companies' continued success in the country.
 The group, called Indiatech, will begin its operations early next year. Chief among its agenda is to coax the government in New Delhi into passing regulations to help local companies dominate the country's internet market, industry sources told CNBC.
The new group represents an aggressive new strategy for a local industry that has been scrambling to compete with global giants — and repeatedly come up short. If the lobbying efforts are successful, they could benefit domestic firms while squeezing out big-name companies like Amazon and Uber from the hugely promising market.
 Online retailer Flipkart, Uber rival Ola and messaging app Hike are among the Indian tech companies behind the new lobbying effort. Local grocery marketplace Grofers, travel booking service MakeMyTrip, online classifieds platform Quikr and VC firms Matrix and Kalaari have also joined the organization, people familiar with the matter said.
""If one of the participating members went to the government with a proposal of this kind, it will not be taken seriously,"" said one source with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity as he wasn't authorized to speak to the press. ""But if an industry lobby body, which represents nearly all of the local giants, makes a suggestion, it will be heard.""
 Stumbling unicorns
 On paper, Flipkart appears to have moved beyond its 2016 struggles to raise money: It  secured $4 billion from a myriad of global investors including SoftBank, Microsoft and eBay this year — albeit at a valuation of $11.6 billion from $15 billion two years ago.
But while Flipkart was struggling to raise capital, rival Amazon doubled down on its India bet by pumping $3 billion into the local operations. The announcement bolstered Amazon's total planned investment in the country, which it entered in 2013, to $5 billion.
The results of that strategy are clear: During the important festival of Diwali, a period traditionally crucial for retail companies in the country, Amazon India surpassed Flipkart in sales for the first time.
E-commerce isn't the only sector seeing a showdown: Other Indian unicorns such as ride-hailer Ola and messaging app Hike are also struggling to put up a strong fight against global rivals, such as Uber and Facebook's WhatsApp, respectively. Those firms, along with others from the U.S., China and Europe, have entered India with huge supplies of capital at their disposal.

 The darlings of India's tech startups have attempted to put up a brave front by offering lofty discounts and expanding their portfolios, but the formation of the lobbying group shows their new strategy is to seek the government's protection from the global onslaught.
The organization would convince the government to make the ""right policies, and bring to their notice the interventions and some decisions that will help us,"" an executive at one of the founding members of Indiatech said. ""The end goal is to help Indian companies get preferential treatment,"" the executive added, requesting anonymity.
It's worth noting that many of the start-ups seeking protectionist regulation have benefited from international investors. In fact, some of the biggest-name members in the lobbying group — Flipkart, Ola, Hike, Grofers and Quikr — share Japan's SoftBank as an investor.
""Our intent is to work with the government to support the development of the rapidly evolving Internet ecosystem in the country and we hope the organization would facilitate this,"" a SoftBank spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.
Flipkart, Hike and Grofers declined to elaborate to CNBC about the rationale behind participating in the Indiatech group.
 Protectionism
 Calls for the Indian government to intervene and protect local companies are part of a narrative in the making for more than a year. Notably, at a conference last December, Sachin Bansal, co-founder and executive chairman of Flipkart, suggested that the Indian government  should do ""what China did 15 years ago and tell the world we need your capital, but we don't need your companies.""
Also in attendance at that conference, Bhavish Aggarwal, the CEO and founder of Ola, echoed Bansal's suggestion: ""There is a narrative of innovation that non-Indian companies espouse, but the real fight is on capital, not innovation. The markets are being distorted by capital,"" he said at the time.
Their views were met with a mixed response from industry leaders, some of whom pointed out the irony that both Flipkart and Ola have raised much of their capital from foreign firms. Regardless, some say the stakes are too high for government inaction.
""If the government doesn't wake up, it will see Silicon Valley kill off a large segment of its entrepreneurship ecosystem and challenge its leading retail and technology companies,"" Vivek Wadhwa, tech entrepreneur and distinguished fellow at Carnegie Mellon University's College of Engineering, told CNBC.
""Foreign companies will gather massive amounts of private data about every Indian citizen — even more than the Indian government has. Facebook and Google will have the tools to sway Indian public opinion and affect elections. This is dangerous for any democracy,"" he added, saying he believed the government should learn from China, which he says realized very early on that if it allowed Silicon Valley giants to dominate its internet, they would hurt local companies.
Chinese companies are now rivals to Silicon Valley, and firms like Tencent and Alibaba lead the nation's internet market. Last month, China's Tencent hit a market capitalization of $500 billion.
Along those lines, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of e-commerce and electronic payment company Paytm, recently said in a Twitter post that ""India is effectively letting modern world East India Companies own its Internet.""
Alibaba-backed Paytm is facing heat from services by global companies. Its wallet application, used by over 200 million users in the country, has seen strong growth of late, but other companies are interested in moving in on the market. Google introduced Tez payments app for India in September, and it has already amassed 12 million customers, the company said. On top of that, Facebook's WhatsApp, used by more than 200 million users in India, is said to be considering plans to integrate a payment option in its app. Paytm declined to comment for this story.
Some warn, however, that replicating an approach similar to that of China could go terribly wrong.
""It is counterproductive to look at China selectively and cherry-pick parts of protectionism we like,"" said Prasanto Roy, vice president and head of the Internet, Mobile and E-commerce Council at the National Association of Software and Services Companies — an industry group set up in 1988 for India's then-nascent software and IT industry.
""Protectionism is a double-edged sword and any attempt at raising trade barriers could hurt more than help India if there is reciprocal action. Keep in mind that the $150 billion IT industry (two-third of it software and services exports) is premised on an open, non-protectionist global marketplace,"" he added.
Eyes are on the government now, but not everyone believes New Delhi would pass new laws to help local tech firms.
""The government wants investors and foreign companies to come to India and create more jobs and opportunities in the country. I don't think the government would take any action to hurt foreign companies in any way,"" said Satish Meena, an analyst at Forrester Research.
Officials at the Department of Industrial Policy & Promotion weren't available to comment.
 A market in flux
 The recent arrivals of Amazon, Uber and Netflix in India and the aggressive expansions of businesses by Facebook, Microsoft and Google have changed the dynamics of the local market. Those global firms bring some services to the table that no Indian company rivals, but they're even gaining traction in categories in which domestic firms had a first-mover advantage.
In 2015, Flipkart and Snapdeal together accounted for 75 percent of the online retail market in India, according to financial services firm Morgan Stanley. Today, however, much has changed: Flipkart and Amazon India are jockeying to be market leader, and Snapdeal, which recently ended merger talks with Flipkart to no avail, has seen its market share collapsing.
In October, Amazon India announced it had more than 44 percent of total customer share and more than 42 percent of total transactions during the festival of Diwali, citing third-party data from market research firm Kantar. Amazon credited its Prime subscription service, which it launched in India last year, for helping it bolster sales.
 Chart: Amazon India's app recently surpassed Flipkart's app on the monthly active users milestone, figures from 7 Park Data suggest.
Similar is the fate of ride-hailing service Ola, which has been somewhat successful but only by burning capital at a fast clip to keep Uber at bay. It raised $1.1 billion this October from investors including Tencent and SoftBank at an estimated valuation of $7 billion, and it expects to raise an additional $1 billion in coming weeks.
That investment, a source familiar with the matter said, will be led by SoftBank, which plans to bet another $600 million on the company.
Ola maintains its market-leading position in the country, serving in more than 100 cities, but Uber is quickly catching up. Both the companies are trying to boost the number of rides on their platforms by subsidizing the cost of rides.
""We are growing incredibly fast, focusing on the metrics and features that matter the most: reliability, quick arrival times and the best customer service experience,"" an Uber spokesperson said. Ola declined to comment.
Uber India and Amazon India, for their part, have also fiercely slammed the notion that they are not Indian companies. Amazon India is a ""completely India registered entity, and as Indian as any other,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have consistently maintained our support for free support for capital movement. Free flow of capital is not only good for customers but also helps create jobs, develop infrastructure, aids the growth of small businesses and facilitates India's economic development.""
Uber India said it is ""led and staffed by local teams who know their cities better than anyone. We bring global expertise to India, but wouldn't have been able to get where we are today without a local-first approach.""
Uber has invested north of $1 billion in the country, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said at a recent conference that the company is in heavy investment mode in India.

The Facebook Inc. logo is displayed with price valuations on monitors during trading at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, U.S., on Friday, May 18, 2012.
 Social media giant Facebook will lead the ""FANG"" stocks higher in 2018 with no correction in sight, according to Evercore ISI.
 In fact, given the large addressable markets that are on the cusp of disruption, analyst Anthony DiClemente argues that the next wave of technology growth could be even larger than the last.
""Today's leading tech companies are leveraging the internet to disrupt and take profits from large established industries, a dynamic that is driving real earnings and free cash flow growth,"" DiClemente wrote to clients on Tuesday. ""Beyond that, smartphone ubiquity, the transition from offline to digital marketplaces, and continued growth in user adoption of emerging/established digital platforms are providing fuel for the next legs of growth.""
 The analyst, who worked previously for Nomura Instinet, initiated coverage on a slew of companies in the space Wednesday with most of the so-called FANG stocks among his favorites. 
By issuing a $225 price target on Mark Zuckerberg's social media giant Facebook, the analyst believes that the company's shares will rise 30 percent over the next year.
""Between 2013 and 2017, the share of web traffic coming via Facebook has grown five-fold to exceed 40 percent, during this same period the value of the overall digital ecosystem has effectively doubled,"" wrote DiClemente. ""Perhaps the most striking dynamic within social media is the incredible growth of Instagram over the past three years. Based on the company's disclosure in late September, Instagram's user base now stands at 800mn, a four-fold increase relative to just three years prior.""
Investors have also been keeping a close eye on Facebook's digital video ambitions, including its new ""Watch"" platform and ventures into sports content. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that the company is willing to spend up to $1 billion on original video content.
As for Amazon, DiClemente was also quite optimistic on everything from Amazon Web Services to Alexa and Prime Instant Video. His $1,350 price target reflects 18 percent upside over the next 12 months.
""Within both e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon has established itself as the clear market leader,"" he added. ""Amazon's competitive advantage, driven by its vast global infrastructure should ensure continued attractive returns in our view.""
DiClemente also issued an outperform rating on Google parent Alphabet accompanied by a $1,230 price target, representing 21 percent upside over the next 12 months. With the ongoing shift to mobile platforms and web searches, the analyst argues that Google will ""outpace"" the growth of the overall search industry.
As the only FANG stock that did not receive an outperform rating, Netflix may be facing a maturing subscriber base in the U.S., the analyst noted. 
While DiClemente sees a long runway for subscriber growth overseas, a possible slowdown in domestic user growth may force the company to consider its price power. In October, Netflix announced that its $10/month high-definition plan now costs $11, sending shares soaring at the time of the announcement.
To be sure, the analyst's $210 price target does spell meaningful, 14 percent upside for the company over the next year.

Investors scrutinized Washington as they awaited new details on Congress negotiations to overhaul the U.S. tax code. The GOP-led Congress passed a bill on Saturday that increased the chances of the overhaul —which would significantly lower corporate taxed — taking place this year.
But the Senate's bill is different than another one passed by the House. Now both chambers have to work on and pass a new bill before sending it to the White House.

 Expectations of tax reform have been a boon for U.S. stocks all year, helping then surge to record highs. But the rip-roaring rally has slowed down recently. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq completed a first three-day losing streak on Tuesday, their first since August.
""You definitely have a market that's taking a pause,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR. ""I think it's really about how quickly we've rotated into the pro-tax reform sectors.""
Financials, one of the sectors that would theoretically benefit greatly from lower corporate taxes, have been on a tear recently. The sector is up 1.4 percent over the past week. Tech, meanwhile, is down more than half a percent in the same period.
Komal Sri-Kumar, president of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, said the market is taking a pause as it's ""not clear that the tax changes that the Senate approved during the early hours of Saturday are going to be as stimulative as the markets first thought.""
Investors also looked ahead to a potential government shutdown. If Congress fails to craft a deal on government spending by the end of the week, the federal government could close until a deal is struck.  
The House Rules Committee had delayed a meeting from Tuesday to Wednesday to discuss funding rules after the deadline on Friday.
""The reason this delay increases a potential shutdown threat slightly is that it leaves the Senate less time to pass a funding agreement and increases the difficulty in negotiating a compromise with the House should one become necessary,"" said Larry McDonald,  head of the U.S. macro strategies at ACG Analytics and editor of The Bear Traps Report, in a note.
U.S. equities kicked off the session trading lower as overseas stocks declined. Asian stocks fell broadly, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index both pulling 2 percent. The Shanghai composite also fell 0.3 percent.
In Europe, equities also declined. The German Dax dropped 0.4 percent while the Stoxx 600 index slipped 0.1 percent.
""We're seeing some end-of-year jitters and we're now taking some profits,"" said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments.

98,2017-12-07,"Instagram is testing Direct, a standalone messaging app that replaces the current inbox  Pinterest hires former Facebook exec to run deals ahead of expected IPO filing  ","Getty Images
 Instagram is testing a standalone app for private messages called Direct, a first step toward possibly toward removing messaging features from the core app. Direct, which opens to the camera in the same way Snapchat does, will become available on Android and iOS today in six countries: Chile, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Uruguay. If you install Direct, the inbox disappears from the Instagram app and can only be accessed in the messaging app. If Instagram introduces Direct globally — it currently has no timeline for doing so — the move could give parent company Facebook a third popular messaging tool alongside Messenger and WhatsApp.
Although it is officially only a test, Instagram's rationale for building Direct app is that private messaging can never be a best-in-class experience when it lives inside an app meant for broadcasting publicly. ""We want Instagram to be a place for all of your moments, and private sharing with close friends is an important part of that,"" Hemal Shah, an Instagram product manager, told me. ""Direct has grown within Instagram over the past four years, but we can make it even better if it stands on its own. We can push the boundaries to create the fastest and most creative space for private sharing when Direct is a camera-first, standalone app.""
If that sounds familiar, it's because Facebook has undertake a transition like this before. In 2014, the company  shut off messaging inside the flagship app, forcing users to download Messenger. ""On mobile, each app can only focus on doing one thing well,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg  said at the time. ""Asking folks to install another app is a short term painful thing, but if we wanted to focus on serving this [use case] well, we had to build a dedicated and focused experience.""
 Direct was built according to similar logic. While direct messaging was originally an afterthought in Instagram, after multiple  redesigns it had accumulated 375 million monthly users by April of this year, the company says. Its rise has coincided with the growth of Instagram stories, which encourage users to fire back quick replies to friends' messages by adding a ""send message"" box underneath each one.
Now Instagram will see whether its tools for private messages can thrive on their own. There is reason to believe that they will: messaging apps have  more aggregate users than social networks do, and some have speculated that growing cultural tensions are pushing more conversations from public forums to private groups. If messaging becomes a large, pseudo-independent pillar of Instagram, it could further entrench the app in the lives of its users while opening up significant new business opportunities.

In its current, experimental state, there is little in Direct you won't currently find in Instagram. The app consists of just three screens. Like Snapchat, it opens to the camera, in an effort to get you in the habit of regularly sharing. (You don't have to take a photo, though; you can also pull down to reveal a screen that lets you type your message.) To the left of the camera is a profile screen that lets you access settings, switch accounts, and navigate to various corners of Instagram. To the right is your inbox of messages. That's the whole app.
Still, there are some nice touches. Designers built what might be the niftiest app transition I've ever seen: If you start swiping to the right of the Direct inbox, an Instagram logo pops begins to peak out from the side of the app. Swipe all the way to the right and Direct will open Instagram. Similarly, you can swipe right in Instagram to reveal the Direct logo — a modified version of the paper-plane logo Instagram has long used for messages — and completing your swipe will take you back to Direct.
The other novelty to be found in the test app is four exclusive filters, all of which I wish were available in the Instagram app. One filter bleeps you at random while blurring your mouth, which you'll appreciate if you've ever enjoyed Jimmy Kimmel's  unnecessary censorship videos. Another filter creates a live cut-out of your mouth and superimposes it over your actual mouth, making you look like an insane clown. A third filter creates an infinite video loop zooming in on your open mouth as multiple versions of your head swirl around you.
If there's a down side to Direct, it's that getting the full Instagram experience will now require users to shuttle back and forth between apps. This may feel particularly acute for people who start a lot of chats from the stories feed (this is my own most common use of Instagram messages). In my experience, using a brand-new iPhone X, navigating between apps was all but seamless. I'll be curious to see how it looks on older model phones, and in countries where data connections may be less reliable.
When Facebook split Messenger from the main app, it drew an outcry from users, who pelted it with  one-star reviews. Today, the app has  1.3 billion monthly users — up from 500 million the year that it split — and yet its rating has risen to just three stars on iOS. (Instagram has a five-star rating.)
One conclusion a company might draw from this experience is that while some users will complain about having to download a second app, the improved experience will help the overall audience grow much larger. And yet I can't imagine the product team at Instagram will be satisfied with a three-star rating for Direct. And so I think there's a second, equally important lesson to take from Messenger's experience.
It's hard to remember now, but Messenger was once as fast and simple as Direct is today. It was only once it spun out on its own that it became the overstuffed junk drawer it is today: a bewildering combination of private messages, group chats, ephemeral stories, gaming, customer service bots, payments, and phone calls. The challenge for Instagram is to expand Direct's feature set while retaining the simplicity that made it attractive in the first place.

 The company is hiring Facebook's director of corporate development, Gary Johnson, to join PInterest as its head of corporate and business development. Johnson will ""focus on leading strategy for key global business initiatives and growing and scaling Pinterest's corporate development and business development teams,"" according to a company announcement.
This comes as sources say Pinterest plans to take steps next year to prepare for an IPO. Johnson will report to another important pre-IPO hire: Pinterest's CFO Todd Morgenfeld, who was previously a finance VP at Twitter after working at Silver Lake Partners as well AS Goldman Sachs.
 Pinterest was valued at $12.3 billion in its most recent fundraising round over the summer of 2017. That round amounted to $150 million, which brings the total amount Pinterest has raised to nearly $1.5 billion. Pinterest is reportedly targeting $500 million in revenue this year, as it expands its revenue streams with partnerships with Target as well as Samsung.
This comes just a week after Pinterest's president and top business exec Tim Kendall announced he's leaving at the end of the year. The company announced he'll be replaced by Google veteran Jon Alferness, who joined the company this past summer.

 Former Facebook exec says social media is ripping apart society   
 5:54  PM ET Mon, 11 Dec 2017 |  01:09 
 Another former Facebook executive has spoken out about the harm the social network is doing to civil society around the world. Chamath Palihapitiya, who joined Facebook in 2007 and became its vice president for user growth, said he feels ""tremendous guilt"" about the company he helped make. ""I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works,"" he told an audience at Stanford Graduate School of Business, before recommending people take a ""hard break"" from social media.
Palihapitiya's criticisms were aimed not only at Facebook, but the wider online ecosystem. ""The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops we've created are destroying how society works,"" he said, referring to online interactions driven by ""hearts, likes, thumbs-up."" ""No civil discourse, no cooperation; misinformation, mistruth. And it's not an American problem — this is not about Russians ads. This is a global problem.""
He went on to describe an incident in India where hoax messages about kidnappings shared on WhatsApp led to the  lynching of seven innocent people. ""That's what we're dealing with,"" said Palihapitiya. ""And imagine taking that to the extreme, where bad actors can now manipulate large swathes of people to do anything you want. It's just a really, really bad state of affairs."" He says he tries to use Facebook as little as possible, and that his children ""aren't allowed to use that s**t."" He later adds, though, that he believes the company ""overwhelmingly does good in the world.""
 Palihapitiya's remarks follow similar statements of contrition from others who helped build Facebook into the powerful corporation it is today. In November, early investor Sean Parker said he has become a ""conscientious objector"" to social media, and that Facebook and others had succeeded by ""exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology."" A former product manager at the company, Antonio Garcia-Martinez, has said Facebook lies about its ability to influence individuals based on the data it collects on them, and wrote a book, Chaos Monkeys, about his work at the firm.
These former employees have all spoken out at a time when worry about Facebook's power is reaching fever pitch. In the past year, concerns about the company's  role in the US election and its capacity to  amplify fake news have grown, while other reports have focused on how the social media site has been implicated in atrocities like  the ""ethnic cleansing"" of Myanmar's Rohingya ethnic group.
More from The Verge:

In his talk, Palihapitiya criticized not only Facebook, but Silicon Valley's entire system of venture capital funding. He said that investors pump money into ""s**tty, useless, idiotic companies,"" rather than addressing real problems like climate change and disease. Palihapitiya currently runs his own VC firm, Social Capital, which focuses on funding companies in sectors like healthcare and education.
Palihapitiya also notes that although tech investors seem almighty, they've achieved their power more through luck than skill. ""Everybody's bulls**tting,"" he said. ""If you're in a seat, and you have good deal flow, and you have precious capital, and there's a massive tailwind of technological change ... Over time you get one of the 20 [companies that become successful] and you look like a genius. And nobody wants to admit that but that's the f**king truth.""

 Internet analyst: User satisfaction lowest at Twitter   
 2:22  PM ET Mon, 11 Dec 2017 |  04:24 
 Instagram is hanging on to a demographic that's rapidly abandoning the Facebook platform, according to a new RBC Capital Markets survey, making Mark Zuckerberg's buy of the photo-sharing app ""one of the best acquisitions in internet history"" according to one analyst. 
 ""We clearly see a fade amongst the 13- to 18-year-olds in usage of Facebook, and I think most people would probably intuitively feel that that's happening,"" Mark Mahaney, lead internet analyst at RBC, told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" Monday. 
73 percent of survey respondents between the ages of 13 and 18 had an Instagram account. Only 57 percent had a Facebook account. 
 Both social media platforms dropped in usage among that youngest cohort in the six months preceding the report, but Facebook took a much larger hit than Instagram. In June, RBC found 81 percent of 13- to 18-year-olds had Instagram accounts and 75 percent had Facebook accounts.

 8:44  PM ET Tue,  7 Nov 2017 |  03:04 
 Instagram, then, is ""the teen and millennial hedge for Facebook,"" Mahaney said.
The RBC survey is relatively new, now in its third six-month iteration, so it's not yet clear from the survey how users grow into our out of particular social media platforms. Mahaney said it's possible those 13- to 18-year-olds will get older and return to the Facebook platform. 
""It's going to be like a utility. People like utilities — there's no emotional attachment to a utility, but you'll use it as a utility to keep in contact with extended family and friends,"" Mahaney said. ""But the hearts for young people clearly are with Snapchat, the hearts clearly are with Instagram."" 
To be sure, Facebook still far outpaces Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat in percent of U.S. internet users with an account. 
According to the survey, 91 percent of all U.S. internet users have a Facebook account. Instagram comes in at only 47 percent of all U.S. internet users, Twitter at 42 percent and Snapchat at 31 percent.

 });Google used to be the main source of referral traffic for web publishers. Then Facebook eclipsed it.
And now, Google is back on top again.
Over the course of 2017, the search engine has become publishers' main source of external page views, according to new data from Parse.ly, a digital analytics company.
 It's basically a flip from the beginning of the year: In January, Facebook provided nearly 40 percent of publishers' external traffic; now that's down to 26 percent. And Google, which started the year at 34 percent, now generates 44 percent of traffic. Parse.ly's data comes from some 2,500 publishers that use its analytics service, including the Wall Street Journal, Time Inc., Mashable and Huffington Post.
 You can point to a number of factors, but there are a few obvious ones to consider:
 Facebook is constantly updating its news feed algorithm and any changes to the way Facebook surfaces stories could have far-reaching effects on publishers. Last year, for example, the social media company  tweaked its algorithm to prioritize posts from friends and family over publishers. Facebook's ""Instant Articles"" feature, where the service hosted some publishers' content directly but promised to send more readers to the original site as well, has declined in importance. There's been a broad move toward publishing video directly on Facebook, which could affect how many links to web stories publishers put on their Facebook pages. Any algorithms on Facebook that prioritize native video over text links could have an effect, too. Google's AMP — accelerated mobile pages — feature, which also hosts publishers' content directly on Google's servers, has become more important. AMP stories — typically from news publishers — are surfaced at the top of mobile search results as ""Top Stories,"" which drives clicks.

 Why Chamath Palihapitiya's family  doesn't get screen time   
 10:49  AM ET Tue, 12 Dec 2017 |  03:05 
 He runs a $2.6 billion technology venture capital firm based in Palo Alto, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley.
 He was an early Facebook executive and an early bitcoin adopter.
But Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC on Tuesday he keeps his kids as far away from technology as possible.
 The device rules in his household?
The founder and CEO of Social Capital said: ""There's no screen time whatsoever.""
No iPhones.
No iPads.
No computers.
In a ""Squawk Box"" interview, Palihapitiya said his three children, ages 5 to 9, still ask ""all the time because their friends have it all the time."" But he said he never gives in, except for the occasional movie.
Palihapitiya is married to Brigette Lau, a partner and co-founder of Social Capital.
""Here's the life that I live with my children, which may not be for everyone,"" he said. ""I don't like this co-dependency of 'they need to rely on me, and when they can't, I feed them a device because that becomes a babysitter'.""
Palihapitiya, who grew up in Canada after his family emigrated from Sri Lanka and was granted refugee status, believes that kids learn and thrive by having real-life experiences.
""You go figure it out. Go outside, skin your knee. Fall on the ground. Play a sport. Lose at something. And then come back to me and we can talk about it. And we'll talk about it as rational human beings. And I'll try to tell you why that's a good thing that's happened to you,"" he said.
Palihapitiya's comments about kids and technology were part of a broader discussion about the impact of social media, a medium he helped foster when he worked at Facebook.
He told CNBC on Tuesday: ""The tools that we have created today are starting to erode the social fabric of how society works.""
While saying his feelings about social media are not a knock on his former employer, Facebook took issue with Palihapitiya's comments, saying in a statement that he hasn't worked for the company for six years, and claiming the company has undergone changes since then.
In his four-year tenure at Facebook, which started in 2007, Palihapitiya held various management roles there, including vice president of user growth.

 Ex-Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya: Social media is 'ripping apart' society   
 7:41  AM ET Tue, 12 Dec 2017 |  04:03 
 Ex-Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC on Tuesday that social media is creating a society that confuses ""popularity"" with ""truth.""
 ""The tools that we have created today are starting to erode the social fabric of how society works,"" he said in a ""Squawk Box"" interview, in response to questions about similar comments he made that went viral. At a recent Stanford Graduate School of Business event, Palihapitiya said social media is tearing society apart.
On CNBC, he explained what he meant. ""Today we live in a world now where it is easy to confuse truth and popularity. And you can use money to amplify whatever you believe and get people to believe what is popular is now truthful. And what is not popular may not be truthful.""
 ""The reality is, I can take money and I can use that through all the social media systems that exist to hundreds of millions of people,"" said Palihapitiya, founder and CEO venture capital powerhouse Social Capital, which has $2.6 billion in assets under management.
""We can do that about vaccines, we can do that about gay rights, we can do that about bathroom laws, we can do that about Roy Moore,"" he said.
Supporters and detractors of Moore — the Republican Senate candidate from Alabama, accused of sexual misconduct with teens — have used social media to argue their points ahead of Tuesday's special election. The influence of social media on politics is also at the center of the investigations into Russia's use of Facebook and Twitter to influence the 2016 presidential election.
Palihapitiya said social media exploits ""our own natural tendencies in human beings to get and want feedback."" He said the question people must ask is: ""How do we live in a world where that is now possible?""
""That feedback, chemically speaking, is the release of dopamine in your brain,"" Palihapitiya said. The ""feedback loops"" get people to react, he added. ""I think if you get too desensitized and you need it over and over and over again, then you become actually detached from the world in which you live.""
Despite being a tech leader, Palihapitiya said he keeps his children away from social media by giving them ""no screen time whatsoever."" He said they don't get to use any devices.
Palihapitiya, also co-owner of the NBA's Golden State Warriors, said his comments and actions were not direct attacks at Facebook. ""I owe those guys everything,"" he said. ""They made me.""
But Facebook took issue with Palihapitiya's comments, saying he hasn't worked for the company for six years and claiming the company has undergone changes since:
 ""Chamath has not been at Facebook for over 6 years. When Chamath was at Facebook we were focused on building new social media experiences and growing Facebook around the world. Facebook was a very different company back then, and as we have grown, we have realized how our responsibilities have grown too. We take our role very seriously and we are working hard to improve. We've done a lot of work and research with outside experts and academics to understand the effects of our service on well-being, and we're using it to inform our product development. We are also making significant investments more in people, technology and processes, and - as Mark Zuckerberg said on the last earnings call – we are willing to reduce our profitability to make sure the right investments are made.""  
 Over his four-year tenure at Facebook, which started in 2007, Palihapitiya served in various management roles, including vice president of user growth.
Meanwhile, Andrew McCollum, a member of Facebook's founding team, responded to Palihapitiya's remarks on the state of social media.
In an interview on CNBC shortly after Facebook's statement, McCollum said the social network's founders want to provide ""value to people's lives.""
""Like Chamath, I also have not been at Facebook full time for a long time,"" McCollum, now CEO of media company Philo, told ""Squawk Alley."" ""I can say from my time there in those very early days, you know, I saw a group of people that to a person was really deeply and completely focused on how they could build a product and a service that really provided value in people's lives.""
""I think that we're lucky that the group of people that runs Facebook, many of which are still there today, have that focus,"" he added.

David Wehner, Facebook CFO
 Facebook's decision to book European sales through individual countries there starting next year — rather than through a regional headquarters in Dublin — signals that the company thinks higher tax rates are coming in Europe.
 It's unlikely CFO David Wehner would undertake the costs of making such a change if Facebook hadn't already sounded things out in Brussels and heard changes are coming in 2018, in the form of higher taxes for U.S. internet companies.
And taxes are not the only EU expense the company faces that is likely going up next year.
 Facebook has already warned of higher costs overall, with an initial 2018 forecast that global expenses will rise between 45 percent and 60 percent from this year.
One big driver is the need to add more workers to take down content that violates national laws. Facebook says it is adding 10,000 people for that task.
Countries in Europe — where Facebook got 24 percent of its revenue last quarter — are adopting laws and regulations to rein in the anarchic or Wild West nature of social media, where hateful, divisive and sometimes dangerous content can flourish.
Germany, for example, passed a law in June that will fine U.S. companies such as Facebook, Alphabet and Twitter for letting racist or terrorist videos remain on its site for more than 24 hours. Political leaders in the U.K. and France, which like Germany have suffered terrorist attacks, have warned the companies that similar laws could be coming in their nations.
Add to that a new EU privacy law that goes into effect in May that will require Facebook, Google and others to stop collecting information on citizens who opt out.
This tighter regulation could get expensive for Facebook if, for example, illegal content is found, leading to fines from German regulators.
Finding content that slips through the companies' filters is not hard. CNBC and other media outlets have found illegal Facebook and YouTube videos and posts that remained on their sites for weeks and months.
Leaders in Brussels are planning to meet in March to discuss blanket tax reform on a region that's home to 17 percent of Facebook monthly users.
The new rules would prevent companies from using countries with lower corporate tax rates, such as Ireland, to reduce their tax bill.
That's why Facebook is going through the cost and expense of keeping a set of books in each of the EU countries it operates in.

 Ex-Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya: Social media is 'ripping apart' society   
 7:41  AM ET Tue, 12 Dec 2017 |  04:03 
 Facebook on Tuesday rejected claims by former executive Chamath Palihapitiya that the social media site is ""ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.""
 Palihapitiya has repeatedly criticized social media in general, saying it preys on human vulnerabilities and that he doesn't allow his children to use it. But the Social Capital founder turned his comments to his former employer specifically in recent days, including Tuesday morning on CNBC.
Facebook hit back noting Palihapitiya hasn't worked for the company for six years, and it said it has undergone changes since.
 Here's the full statement:
 Chamath has not been at Facebook for over six years. When Chamath was at Facebook we were focused on building new social media experiences and growing Facebook around the world. Facebook was a very different company back then and as we have grown we have realised how our responsibilities have grown too. We take our role very seriously and we are working hard to improve. We've done a lot of work and research with outside experts and academics to understand the effects of our service on well-being, and we're using it to inform our product development. We are also making significant investments more in people, technology and processes, and – as Mark Zuckerberg said on the last earnings call – we are willing to reduce our profitability to make sure the right investments are made. 
While Palihapitiya didn't specifically call out Facebook by name on CNBC, he's made pointed criticism several times recently about how damaging social media has been to U.S. society — and has specifically said he feels ""tremendous guilt"" about what he helped bring into existence.
Social media exploits ""our own natural tendencies in human beings to get and want feedback,"" he said on CNBC. ""How do we live in a world where that is now possible?"" he asked.
He also made it clear he was not attacking Facebook directly. 
""I owe those guys everything,"" he said. ""They made me.""

 Here's a look back at Mark Zuckerberg's big year   
 11:26  AM ET Tue, 12 Dec 2017 |  00:48 
 Mark Zuckerberg had a bountiful 2017 — even though the year ended with the company he leads facing a barrage of criticism over its growing impact on politics and society.
 Facebook's surging stock price — up more than 50 percent this year — drove Zuckerberg's wealth to $56 billion, making him one of the world's five wealthiest people, according to Forbes.
In May, he received an honorary degree from Harvard, where he'd famously dropped out in 2004 to start Facebook.
 In July, he went to Chicago to announce Facebook would soon hit 2 billion global users, while rededicating the company to what he called a new mission.
Zuckerberg also completed a personal travel challenge: to visit over 30 of the U.S. states he hadn't been to before.
At home, he and wife Priscilla Chan welcomed a second child into their family as daughter August was born in the month she was named for.
These highlights were noted via popular posts on his own Facebook page, which has an audience of 99 million followers.
The post of the baby's birth, for example, drew reactions from 2.5 million users, 154,000 of whom took the time to comment.
Still, all of that came before September, when Zuckerberg apologized for comments he made in December 2016, when he said it was ""laughable"" to think Facebook's technology might have impacted the U.S. presidential election.
Facebook itself now says an online propaganda operation based in Russia placed divisive political ads over a two-year period that may have been seen by as many as 126 million Americans.
In October, the person who ran President Donald Trump's online ad operation told a national TV audience that the campaign's use of Facebook was a major factorin the contest.
That opened the gates to a season of criticism directed toward the company from many quarters. 
Among the criticisms: That its technology has helped widen political divisions and unfairly hooked consumers into using its services by playing on their social needs and interests.
Throughout the fall, a number of Facebook's early backers and employees have raised alarms about the company's growing power.
They include early executive Sean Parker and venture capitalists Chamath Palihapitiya and Roger McNamee, who said he regrets investing in the company.
One former privacy manager wrote a damning op-ed about his experience at the company, saying it ""prioritized data collection over user protection.""
Members of Congress — Republicans and Democrats — have proposed legislation and regulation that could crimp growth at the company. 
One would force Facebook to disclose more about who buys political ads and would make Facebook — and its fellow internet giants like Google — legally liable for content on their sites.
CNBC and other news organizations have shown that the company's platform hosts many types of content that Facebook's own rules say it shouldn't, such as videos marketing illegal opioid sales and housing ads targeted by race.
Despite all the blowback, however, Zuckerberg ended the year making good on a commitment he'd made when his second daughter was born.
On Dec. 2, Zuckerberg said he would be taking off to finish his paternity leave.

101,2017-12-13,"Facebook Messenger boss David Marcus joins Coinbase board  Facebook is paying WWE to stream some professional wrestling  Why Google, Facebook were surprised by Russian propaganda, extremist content—naivete, say Eric Schmidt and Reid Hoffman  ","Stephen Lam | Reuters
David Marcus, vice president of Messaging Products at Facebook, speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, April 18, 2017.
 A top Facebook executive is joining the board of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.
 David Marcus, head of Facebook's Messenger service, will join the venue's board of directors, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a  blog post Tuesday.
 Tweet
 Coinbase is currently the most popular app on Apple's App Store, according to data by market insights firm App Annie. It has experienced a number of outages in recent weeks as investment in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has surged.
On Tuesday, the platform told users that transactions in Ethereum and Litecoin were temporarily disabled. Although it did not immediately explain why, the company said in a statement last week it had been ""experiencing record high traffic"" after its website went down for about an hour.
Coinbase said it would look to harness Marcus' experience in payments and mobile technology. The Facebook Messenger chief has also served as president of PayPal.
""David's perspective and experience in bringing innovative and impactful products to market will be invaluable to Coinbase as we grow,"" Coinbase's Armstrong said in a statement Tuesday. ""David's knowledge of both the payments and mobile space will help guide us in achieving our mission of creating a truly open financial system that will bring opportunity to people all across the globe.""
Marcus said he had been ""fascinated"" by the cryptocurrency space for five years.
""I've been involved with, and fascinated by cryptocurrencies since 2012, and I've witnessed how Coinbase has started democratizing access to this new asset class,"" he said. ""I'm convinced that what the company is working on has the potential to materially change the lives of people around the world, and I'm looking forward to working with Coinbase and its leadership team to help make this vision a reality.""

Sin Cara jumps during to the WWE Live Duesseldorf event at ISS Dome on February 22, 2017 in Duesseldorf, Germany.
 WWE is coming to Facebook.
The pro wrestling company signed a deal with Facebook to stream a new ""single-elimination mixed tag-team tournament"" directly on the social network. That means WWE will feature tag-team matches — one male and one female wrestler per team — for 12 straight weeks.
These are not the highly touted pay-per-view matches that WWE is known for, but the company is still rolling out some of its biggest stars, like Jimmy Uso and Natalya. (Uso has more than four million Facebook followers, for example.) Facebook is paying WWE for a dozen 20-minute episodes, but a company spokesperson declined to share financial terms of the deal.
 As with the other professional content Facebook has acquired, these WWE matches will exist  inside Facebook Watch, the company's new video tab. Facebook has been paying publishers to create exclusive shows for the service, and has also been paying for streaming rights for sporting events, like  college basketball games. The hope is that Facebook becomes a video destination, not just a place people stumble across video while looking at their friends' vacation photos.
The WWE deal is interesting for a few reasons, though:
 WWE is sneaky popular. At least four of the wrestlers on the docket to participate in this new tournament have more than two million followers apiece on Facebook. For comparison, NFL star quarterbacks like Russell Wilson (Seahawks) and Drew Brees (Saints) have about two million followers each. WWE is going to create the program with feedback from Facebook users. Fans will ""select match-ups and match stipulations,"" according to a WWE press release. It sounds like a ""choose your own adventure""-style program, and if it's a hit, you might see more shows using the same approach as a way to engage viewers. 
The first episode is set to air on Tuesday, Jan. 16, 2018.

 });Violent extremists, racists and Russian-backed propaganda machines have all used social media platforms to disseminate and perpetrate their ideologies. This year, after revelations that Russian-backed ads and fake news attempting to influence the 2016 presidential election were distributed on these platforms, tech behemoths like Facebook and Google have faced increasing criticism for not more appropriately monitoring content.
 So how did this happen?
""One of the problems in the industry is that ... we came from a, shall we say, a more naive position — right? — that illegal actors and these actors would not be so active,"" says Eric Schmidt, the billionaire Executive Chairman of Alphabet, speaking about Google at the  Halifax International Security Forum in November.
 ""But now, faced with the data and what we've seen from Russia in 2016 and with other actors around the world, we have to act"" to remove the content, Schmidt says. 
But the extent of that naivete is debatable. Case in point: It took Google-owned YouTube from 2009 until recently to heed calls to take down videos of jihadist propaganda featuring (now-deceased) well-known ISIS recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki. In part, Google long argued it was a technology platform and therefore not responsible for policing content. YouTube made a change this year so that such content would be automatically removed, according to The New York Times.

""[W]ith respect to YouTube for example, there have been cases where people have uploaded either things which violate our terms of service or things which have been used incorrectly. In the case of YouTube, we have very, very detailed terms of service and after a while, we, after enough people mention it, we typically look at them and decide,"" Schmidt says.
""In this case, I think it was fairly clear, perhaps it was overdue."" 
Billionaire LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman has a similar take on some founders' early naivete. 
 ""With power comes responsibility. With great power comes great responsibility.""
-Reid Hoffman, Co-founder of LinkedIn
 During a talk with Hoffman at an Anti-Defamation League event in November, Recode tech journalist Kara Swisher criticized Silicon Valley's ""lack of responsibility,"" with such content and ""its tarnishing of the American democratic system.""
Like Schmidt, Hoffman, who knows many of the players, says there wasn't ill intent.
""A bunch of these folks that built these systems didn't actually think about hostile attack on them, didn't actually think about what Russians might do in order to hack in, or trying in their own minds to figure out, okay, How are we as democratic and inclusive as possible, and how do we build the algorithms that way?"" says Hoffman.

 ""Yeah, they thought cat videos. Great. Adds a little joy to your life, right?"" says Hoffman.
""I think all of that has been retroactive. Has been, 'Oh s---, people are putting up skinning cat videos, we should do something about that.' Right?""
Blame it on optimism, says Hoffman. 
""To some degree in the early days with technologists, what it is is a little bit like a Roschach test. If you're an optimist, you see optimism. If you're a pessimist, you see pessimism, and so forth. [Mark Zuckerberg's] an optimist, so the kinds of things in the early days ... Talking about Zuck, look, we can connect people and they can share experiences,"" Hoffman says of Facebook.
""All of these things bringing in the human fabric of life, of seeing other people as people. Seeing pictures of them on holiday, or with their kids and that kind of stuff, that was the stuff that was being discussed. It's all the positive use cases.""
Perhaps Zuckerberg was living in a ""Facebook bubble"" before Facebook. But naivete doesn't excuse the blind spot, admits Hoffman. 
""With power comes responsibility. With great power comes great responsibility,"" he says.

102,2017-12-14,Facebook is the best place to work—and it's not just because of the fun perks  Facebook will put ads before videos as part of a new advertising strategy next year  ,"Facebook edged out other industry leaders like Google and Bain & Company to claim the title of best place to work in 2018, according to a ranking by job search platform Glassdoor.
 And it's not just because of the many perks the company offers — which include things like free meals, fun work spaces and access to people like CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 
While employees say those benefits are important, the CEO of Glassdoor and Facebook executives say it's something simpler: how the company views its employees. 
 In an interview with CNBC Make It, Glassdoor CEO and co-founder Robert Hohman says the tech giant has tapped into a key workplace trend.
""Ten years ago people were talking about, 'I appreciate my employer helping me get better at my job,"" Hohman says. ""Now they're talking about, 'I appreciate employers investing in my growth.'""

 Facebook's Vice President of People, Lori Goler, says that in reviewing a recent company-wide employee survey, the word ""fulfilled"" appeared repeatedly. The company did more digging to find out why their employees felt this way. 
""Fulfillment is really about individual impact. It's about learning,"" Goler tells CNBC Make It. ""And it's about playing to your strengths.""
The notion of ""playing to one's strengths,"" the executive adds, means allowing employees to work on new projects and even move around within the company. 
""We really care about making sure that every single person is in a role that plays to their strengths and what they enjoy,"" she says.

 For example, managers at Facebook are trained to help employees find projects they enjoy and have difficult and honest conversations around how their reports are feeling at work.
In addition, employees are allowed to spend days or even weeks working with other teams. While the program is mainly to both help coworkers better understand how different parts of the company works, it can also help employees looking to move within the company.
Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg says the company's focus on fulfillment is key.
 Michael Newberg | CNBC
Sheryl Sandberg
 ""One of the common themes in Glassdoor reviews of Facebook is that people will say they move around within the company,"" Sandberg says in an interview with Hohman.
""It's because we believe skills are more important than experience,"" she adds. ""If you've got the skills, we'll give you the shot.""
Besides allowing workers to follow their own career goals, Facebook has invested in supporting colleagues outside of work, too. Many employees say they value the paid maternity leave and paternity leave, as well as the bereavement leave the company offers.
According to salary data site Paysa, Facebook has one of the highest retention rates of major tech companies, though it stands at just over two years. This, in part, is due to aggressive recruitment in the industry, where top companies vie for great talent. 
Still, for the employees at the company, it's a pretty good deal. 
One employee writes on Glassdoor that you won't find another company ""that cares more about [its] people."" Another says that when it comes to employees, Facebook ""cares deeply, and invests.""

 Facebook is making major changes to its advertising strategy, including putting ads before videos and requiring videos to be longer before they can have ad breaks. 
 The company announced in a blog post on Thursday that it would be adding six-second pre-roll ads before videos starting next year. The ads would likely be before Watch content, Facebook's TV-style show content.
""While pre-roll ads don't work well in News Feed, we think they will work well in Watch because it's a place where people visit and come back to with the intention to watch videos,"" Facebook product management director Maria Angelidou-Smith and product manager Abhishek Bapna wrote in the post. 
 Facebook will also require videos that want to include ad breaks to be at least three minutes long starting in January, with the first ad appearing at the one minute mark. Previously videos had to be a minimum of 90 seconds, and the first ad break was allowed to appear after 20 seconds. Facebook research showed user satisfaction increased 18 percent when the ad break was later in the video, which it believes will lead to more people continuing to watch after the commercial. 
The company will only allow live video ad breaks on pages with more than 50,000 followers, removing ads from people who post live videos on their profile. 
""Live video publishers below this threshold also tend to have smaller audiences for their broadcasts, and therefore aren't able to garner meaningful revenue from Ad Breaks,""  Angelidou-Smith and Bapna wrote. ""We'll continue to work jointly with our partners on testing and improving the product to deliver value.""
In addition, the company said it would be rolling out changes to the News Feed to include more videos from publishers and creators that users frequently view. Creators will also be able to share their videos with all their followers. 
Sponsored videos will still also be allowed. The number of branded videos has quadrupled since the beginning of 2017, the company said.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook.
 Facebook will now let you temporarily mute a friend's posts from your News Feed with a new feature called Snooze. 
 Facebook users could already unfollow someone, hiding their posts entirely without unfriending, but the Snooze feature only mutes the posts for 30 days. 
""Seeing too many photos of your uncle's new cat? Is your friend tempting you with endless photos of ramen on her Japan trip? It turns out, you're not alone,"" the company said in a statement. ""With Snooze, you don't have to unfollow or unfriend permanently, rather just stop seeing someone's posts for a short period of time.""
 Users can mute people, pages or groups. They won't be notified, and the action can be undone at any point in the 30 days. 
The Snooze feature is one of several recent changes to help users better curate their own feeds. Facebook announced Thursday it would prioritize videos and publishers that users frequently return to as part of a new advertising strategy.

 ""My comments were meant to start an important conversation, not to criticize one company — particularly one I love,"" Palihapitiya wrote in a Facebook post Friday. 
The former Facebook executive's comments — including that social media was confusing truth with popularity and ripping apart the fabric of society — drew a pointed response from Facebook earlier this week saying the company has grown since Palihapitiya last worked there six years ago.
 ""Facebook has made tremendous strides in coming to terms with its unforeseen influence and, more so than any of its peers, the team there has taken real steps to course correct,""  Palihapitiya said.

 Facebook admitted on Thursday that using its social network can be bad for you in some instances.
 Facebook's director of research David Ginsberg and research scientist Moira Burke published a post in which they addressed questions about the impact Facebook has on our moods, and revealed some compelling information.
""University of Michigan students randomly assigned to read Facebook for 10 minutes were in a worse mood at the end of the day than students assigned to post or talk to friends on Facebook,"" the blog post said. ""A study from UC San Diego and Yale found that people who clicked on about four times as many links as the average person, or who liked twice as many posts, reported worse mental health than average in a survey.""

 In other words, if you're using Facebook to mindlessly browse through your feed or click posts, you may end up in a foul mood after. 
Facebook also worked with Carnegie Mellon University for additional insight, and found that ""people who sent or received more messages, comments and timeline posts reported improvements in social support, depression and loneliness."" Likewise, Facebook said students at Cornell who used Facebook for 5 minutes while viewing their own profiles saw ""boosts in self-affirmation,"" while folks who looked at other profiles did not.
In other words, using Facebook to interact with people -- as opposed to just ""browsing"" as the University of Michigan study analyzed -- seemed to have a positive effect on people.
Facebook's blog post follows criticisms from former Facebook exec Chamath Palihapitiya, who said recently that social networks such as Facebook are ""starting to erode the social fabric of how society works"" and that they're ""ripping apart"" society. Palihapitiya has since walked back those remarks.
Facebook says it's going to take this data and work to encourage more social interaction among users in an effort to cut down on those who spend it to waste time and, ultimately, feel worse after.

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Facebook Inc., speaks during an event in Menlo Park, California.
 Facebook said Monday the U.S. government is making more secret requests for data about more users than ever before.
 The government made 32,716 requests for data from the company in the first half of 2017, with 57 percent of those requests coming with demands for confidentiality, the company said in its semi-annual Transparency Report.
Those requests asked for data on 52,280 users, and the company provided such data 85 percent of the time.
 The number of requests was up 25.7 percent from the 26,014 made during the last six months of 2016, Facebook said. Those requests covered 41,492 users, and Facebook produced data on 83.4 percent of them.
""Fifty-seven percent of the data requests we received from law enforcement in the U.S. contained a non-disclosure order that prohibited us from notifying the user, up from 50% in our last report,"" the company said in a Facebook post announcing the report.
The report also contained redacted copies of five U.S. requests for data that the company was not allowed to disclose previously due to national security concerns.
These national security letters were received from FBI offices in Michigan, California, Virginia and Florida between 2012 and 2015.
The company also said it received 352,889 copyright and trademark complaints during the first half of this year regarding content on Facebook and Instagram.

A worker moves a bin filled with products inside of an Amazon fulfillment centre in Robbinsville, New Jersey, November 27, 2017.
 The importance of online retail and Amazon's dominion over e-commerce have no end in sight, according to J.P. Morgan.
 Citing Amazon's growing market share and the success of Amazon Web Services, analyst Doug Anmuth argued that Jeff Bezos' retail giant is only just getting started.
""We believe Amazon is well positioned as the market leader in e-commerce, where it's still early days with U.S. e-commerce representing about 12 percent of adjusted retail sales (ex-gas, food, and autos), which we view as likely going to 30 percent over time,"" Anmuth wrote Monday. ""We believe Amazon continues to show strong ability to take share of overall e-commerce, and its flexibility in pushing first-party vs. third-party inventory and its Prime offering both serve as major advantages.""
 As one of Main Street's largest disruptors, Amazon roared through 2017 by keeping pressure on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, sending entire industry groups tumbling after it acquired Whole Foods Market over the summer. Though countless companies have shed share value, Amazon's stock has climbed more than 58 percent since January, one of the best large-cap performances this year.
Anmuth's new $1,375 price target on Amazon shares is 17 percent higher than Friday's closing price. Shares closed up 1 percent Monday.
Though it is known for pairing consumer goods with logistical prowess, Amazon has seen significant growth in its cloud platform, known as Amazon Web Services. As a secure cloud services platform, AWS offers its users computing power, data storage and content delivery to help scale businesses, according to its website.
""We believe AWS is the leader in the public cloud with roughly 75 percent U.S. market share, and it remains early with only about 10 percent or more of workloads in the cloud today and the pace of cloud adoption accelerating in our view,"" explained Anmuth. While the analyst offered positive outlook on Amazon, he also remarked on social media companies Twitter and Facebook and on Priceline.
Calling Twitter one of J.P. Morgan's best ideas in 2018, Anmuth upgraded shares and raised his price target on the popular platform to $27 from $20, implying 21 percent upside over the next 12 months. After an unimpressive start to the year, Twitter staged a 43 percent climb in the past six months — a trend the analyst believes will continue with daily active user growth and scaling ad revenue.
And Anmuth's $225 price target on Facebook reflects his belief in 25 percent upside for the stock in the next year.
The analyst is also bullish on online travel agent Priceline, increasing his price target to $2,050, which is 16 percent higher than Friday's close. His old price target was $1,950.
""We continue to think Priceline is the best in class in online travel with strong growth driven by scale benefits, efficient performance & brand spend, and large and growing supply,"" explained Anmuth. ""We also believe Priceline has the potential to re-accelerate in mid-2018 as comps ease and stepped-up investments start to reap benefits.""

 Facebook will soon demote posts that beg for likes, comments or shares in yet another step to improve the News Feed.
 The so-called ""engagement bait"" posts come with simple requests — ""Tag a friend who needs this!"" — in an effort to rack up engagement and game the Facebook algorithm. 
Facebook said the posts are counter to the company's emphasis on authenticity, and so, starting this week, they'll be pushed lower in users' feeds. 
 ""We want to reduce the spread of content that is spammy, sensational, or misleading in order to promote more meaningful and authentic conversations on Facebook,"" the company said in a statement. 
The change won't affect posts that ask for help, advice or recommendations, according to Facebook, and publishers and Pages will have a couple weeks to adjust before their content is affected. 
Facebook has now made several recent changes to improve the News Feed. Last week the company said it was tweaking which videos users see and introduced a new feature that lets you 'Snooze' posts from a person or Page for 30 days. 
The changes could be in response to research that even 10 minutes of scrolling through Facebook's feed put users in a worse mood.

 Facebook shares are surging this year, but one Wall Street firm says recent underperformance is making him revisit his bullish thesis for the internet company.
 ""If current market trends hold, Facebook's stock price could find itself underperforming the S&P 500 this quarter for the only the third quarter since the start of 2015,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a note to clients Tuesday entitled ""Facebook: Is it Time to Get Out?"" ""As we approach year end, perhaps with this massive outperformance in mind, we are increasingly noticing a greater degree of skepticism about where Facebook will go in 2018.""
Nathanson noted how Facebook shares are up 6 percent since the end of September through Monday versus the S&P 500's 7 percent return. The internet company is up 57 percent year to date compared to the 20 percent gain for the market.
 The analyst still reiterated his buy rating and $205 price target for the social media company, representing 13 percent upside to Monday's close.
Smart investors often investigate the opposite thesis to figure out if their current point-of-view is correct. 
As a result, Nathanson shared his five top reasons why the company's stock can go lower:
 1. ""Facebook's Video Strategy Remains a Mystery … we haven't seen much progress"" in the last six months. 2. ""Will the Next Leg of Growth be Completely Pricing Led? … Facebook has apparently hit the upper bound of its ad load on core Facebook, the story has moved from a largely volume driven one to a largely pricing driven one."" 3. ""Can It Meaningfully Monetize its Other Platforms? … Despite the significant transaction for Messenger and WhatsApp globally, Facebook's ability to meaningfully monetize them still remains a major question mark."" 4. ""Emerging Regulatory Risk … a more significant regulatory overhang … could pressure Facebook's multiple."" 5. ""Everyone Loves … It .. [With Wall Street's] rating distribution that is this overwhelming positive, any hiccups in growth or profitability could lead to a downside reaction that is amplified."" 
Even with the above reasons, the analyst remains optimistic on Facebook stock for next year.
We believe Wall Street's ""top and bottom line estimates for 2018 are too conservative … Facebook remains inexpensive,"" he wrote.

 Facebook is expanding the use of its facial recognition technology to alert users when a photo of them is posted, even if they're not tagged. 
 The idea is to round up photos posted by friends that you might want to add to your profile and to detect when someone else is using your photos as their own. 
The setting is optional and tied into your current use of the site's facial recognition software, which suggests friends to tag in your photos — if you've got that feature turned on, then you would get these new alerts unless you opt out. 
 ""You're in control of your image on Facebook and can make choices such as whether to tag yourself, leave yourself untagged, or reach out to the person who posted the photo if you have concerns about it,"" the company said in a statement. 
The alerts notify users when a friend or someone in their broader network posts a photo ""that might include you,"" and then offers options to ignore the photo, tag themselves, mark that it's not them or report the photo.

 Facebook has changed some of its user rules to curtail online harassment and domestic violence.
 The social network said in a post Tuesday that users can now choose to read or ignore abusive or threatening messages and posts without the sender knowing they are doing so.
""If someone is being harassed, blocking the abuser sometimes prompts additional harassment, particularly offline,"" Facebook said in a post written by Antigone Davis, the company's head of global safety. ""We've also heard from groups that work with survivors of domestic violence that being able to see messages is often a valuable tool to assess if there is risk of additional abuse,"" Davis wrote.
 The product changes are part of broader efforts to combat online violence that include using artificial intelligence to prevent abusive users from opening duplicate or fake accounts.
""These automated features help us identify fake accounts more quickly and block millions of them at registration every day,"" the post said.
Still, the company's software can't catch all abuse among its more than 2 billion global users.
""Sometimes a new account created by someone who was previously blocked might not get caught by these features,"" according to Facebook.
The messaging changes are meant to help protect users from those who slip through and create new accounts to continue the harassment or abuse.
Facebook's head of security, Alex Stamos, said in August that the company was then blocking more than a million attempts a day by users trying to create fake or duplicate accounts.

 Cramer reviews the bear case for FANG stocks   
 6:39  PM ET Tue, 19 Dec 2017 |  00:57 
 After the decline in the FANG stocks on Tuesday, CNBC's Jim Cramer issued a warning to investors who own the technology-laden group.
 ""I just wanted to get in front of tomorrow's storyline,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""You better believe the obituary's being written once again right now, this time with the death notice containing two As and two Ns, as in FAANNG, or Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Nvidia and Google, the company now known as Alphabet.""
Weakness in the FAANNGs is bound to be taken seriously, which is why Cramer looked at the broader market layout, starting with the GOP-led tax overhaul.
 The sweeping tax cuts Republicans are chasing could put a trillion-dollar hole in the U.S. deficit. That would lead the government to borrow money, flooding the bond market with supply and driving interest rates higher.
But higher interest rates usually lead to higher inflation. Inflation erodes purchasing power, which in turn diminishes future earnings estimates.
""Given that the FAANNG stocks represent big bets on the future earnings of high-growth companies, ... inflation's real bad for them, so their stocks sell off when rates go up,"" Cramer said. ""Let me simplify it: higher rates often lead to lower prices for the most juiced stocks out there, and FAANNG be the king of the juice.""
To make sense of the noise (and explain why panic is fruitless), the ""Mad Money"" host went over each FAANNG stock's individual bear case.
 Facebook
 Word on Wall Street is that Facebook's next earnings report will be in line with estimates because the social media giant hasn't come up with a new, hot product in a while.
""It's become same-old, same-old — same-old, same-old great, I should add — and that's not enough for the market,"" Cramer said. ""I'm not kidding — that's really the rap against Facebook.""
 Amazon
 After Citi Research upgraded Walmart on Tuesday, saying that the retailer finally has enough online momentum to seriously compete with Amazon, the Amazon bears came running.
""I think Amazon is fabulous, especially its red-hot web services business,"" Cramer said, even as he agreed that Walmart is a formidable competitor. ""If we get any real weakness, I'll pound the table.""
 Apple
 Cramer has heard every bear case for Apple under the sun, including the latest downgrade that argued the tech stock's gains from the iPhone super-cycle are ""in the late innings.""
""Look, you may be tempted to sell it here and try to buy it back at lower levels,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""I think that's a fool's errand. I say own Apple, don't trade it. Every trading call to get out of Apple has been wrong. This piece did not change my mind.""
 Netflix
 In Cramer's opinion, Netflix's recent decline is all about Disney. Following the Disney-Fox deal, the bears are worried that Disney might build a competing streaming service.
""This is a tough one,"" Cramer admitted. ""I always think, though, what would it take to duplicate Netflix's business? I think certainly it would cost more than the company's current $80 billion valuation. That said, I will concede that it is definitely the most vulnerable of the FAANNGs.""
 Nvidia
 Nvidia's problem has consistently been that the semiconductor play has one of the most expensive stocks in the world.
But Cramer argued that the chipmaker dominates when it comes to gaming, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and the data center, even though its wares will certainly be challenged.
""Does that mean you should sell the stock? Look, Nvidia the stock has periodic swoons, and this one has lasted a long time, ever since the company reported,"" he said. ""I believe it's digesting a big move and this stock, like the other FAANNGs, is simply the victim of a rotation.""
 Alphabet
 The ""Mad Money"" host could hardly find a bear case for the parent company of Google.
""I think it's gaining market share and has about $100 billion in cash to fall back on,"" he said. ""Also, it [has] a swell web service business that's doing fantastically — not as good as Amazon, but still good — and an autonomous car business called Waymo that's second to none. Needless to say, I would not be a seller.""
 Final Thoughts
 In all his years in the business, Cramer has seen the FAANNG stocks pronounced dead plenty of times. But that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the underlying companies, he said.
""Don't let some analyst downgrade or some rotation out of high growth scare you away from owning some FAANNG,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Until I see a coroner's report from real competitors of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Nvidia and Alphabet, I think we need to presume that these stories remain very much alive.""

 Facebook's growth from its new video product will boost the company's shares, according to one Wall Street firm.
 Jefferies reaffirmed its buy rating for the social media giant, predicting the ""Watch"" offering will drive significant sales and increased site use.
""We think Facebook's 'Watch' tab extends its reach into user's video consumption. The 'Watch' tab should drive video engagement and will also provide additional network effects and sharing,"" analyst Brent Thill wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ""We like FB's data-driven approach to content creation and partner rev. share agreements as it manages content investment.""
 Thill reiterated his $225 price target for Facebook shares. That's 25 percent higher than Tuesday's closing price.
Facebook's ""Watch"" video tab launched in August. Thill predicts ""Watch"" could grow to $12 billion in revenue by 2022.
""We believe this will be 'snackable' content versus more premium long-form content which should help drive time spent, more repeat visits,"" he wrote.
We ""see Facebook as one of the best positioned digital players to capitalize on an ad-funded model given Facebook's industry leading advertising technology, user data, and targeting capabilities,"" he wrote.
Facebook shares have rallied 56 percent this year through Tuesday, compared with the market's 20 percent gain.

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
 Facebook and Google's dominance in online advertising continues to swell. 
 New data suggests that the two tech giants accounted for 73% of all U.S. digital advertising, according to Pivotal's Brian Wieser in a note to clients, up from 63% in the second quarter of 2015.
That's a significant leap and highlights why many see digital advertising as a two-pony show, with Facebook and Google taking most of the money while other platforms like Twitter and Snapchat fight publishers for the scraps.
 In the face of that duopoly, there's also been increasing interest around Amazon's ad business, which is starting to be  taken more seriously by brands.
Wieser comes to his estimates by looking at new data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau that shows that digital advertising grew 23% in the second quarter of 2017 to $20.8 billion in ad revenue. Wieser estimates that Facebook and Google account for 83% of that growth. 
Rather than using the new data to push investors to buy stock, Wieser recommends caution because he believes that the we're approaching the saturation point when increases in digital ad budgets won't lead to increased sales. 
""Growth rates are remarkable, but also highlight risks around digital media owners – and Facebook and Google in particular – saturating digital media budgets in years ahead, and reinforce our cautious views on stocks in the sector at current levels,"" he writes. 
That's why Facebook in particular has ""become more aggressive in finding ways to capture television advertising budgets,"" like with its new ""Watch"" video offering.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook.
 Facebook says employment ads that target younger users are not discriminatory if they're part of a broader recruitment campaign aimed at multiple age groups.
 In a post written by Rob Goldman, the company's vice president of ads, Facebook hit back at a report published jointly by the New York Times and ProPublica, a public interest journalism group.
The report accused the company of allowing dozens of companies to use its targeting software to send job ads exclusively to Facebook users of a certain age, in violation of U.S. employment law.
 But that's not necessarily true, Goldman argued.
""Simply showing certain job ads to different age groups on services like Facebook or Google may not in itself be discriminatory — just as it can be OK to run employment ads in magazines and on TV shows targeted at younger or older people. What matters is that marketing is broadly based and inclusive, not simply focused on a particular age group,"" Goldman wrote.
His post began with references to previous stories ProPublic has published showing that Facebook allowed users and businesses to place housing ads that excluded minorities and other ads directed at racists and anti-semites.
""In the last year ProPublica has uncovered a number of different flaws in our advertising systems. Several of them were serious failures on our part. It's why we apologized and took immediate action to prevent them in the future.
""Today ProPublica has raised new concerns about companies, including our own marketing team, using Facebook to show recruitment ads to specific age groups. We have carefully reviewed their concerns — and this time we disagree,"" Goldman wrote in the post.
The company has made changes to improve the transparency of its ad targeting systems, according to Goldman.
""We've also begun requiring businesses that show employment ads on Facebook to certify that they comply with the law before we show their ads. And our ""why am I seeing this ad?"" button has set the industry standard for ads transparency: it's why ProPublica was able to identify these ads in the first place,"" he wrote.
""In this case we disagree with ProPublica. Used responsibly, age-based targeting for employment purposes is an accepted industry practice.""

 Facebook  has announced it will no longer use Disputed Flags to identify false news. Starting from today, the company will use its  Related Articles tool instead to combat misinformation in the News Feed, which it says gives people more context about the story, with the added benefit of reducing the frequency a hoax article is shared.
 After a year of testing, the company found that Disputed Flags inadvertently buried critical information that explained the inaccuracies, and could backfire by entrenching a person's false beliefs. Facebook's previous approach was also slow (taking around 3 days for a rating), required two fact checkers, and only worked for ""false"" ratings, rather than broader contexts like ""partly false"" or ""unproven.""
Facebook started testing a new version of  Related Articles and fact-checked articles earlier this year. It found that click-through rates on the hoax article didn't change between the two treatments, but did find that Related Articles led to fewer shares of the hoax article.
 The company also cites academic research that correcting a post containing misinformation through related articles can significantly reduce misperceptions. ""Using language that is unbiased and non-judgmental helps us to build products that speak to people with diverse perspectives,"" Facebook said in a  Medium post. Related articles also only require one fact checker to review rather than the usual two, which speeds up the process — something Facebook has said it wanted to address. Facebook says it has also placed prominent badges next to each fact checker so users can identify the source.
Facebook says most fake news posted on the platform is financially motivated, aiming for clicks that lead users to websites containing mostly ads. Facebook notes that it's making progress on preventing the spread of false news, by demoting the posts thereby cutting their traffic by 80 percent. ""This destroys the economic incentives spammers and troll farms have to generate these articles in the first place,"" Facebook said in another blog post. Facebook says repeat offenders posting false news will have their advertising rights removed, their distribution reduced, and their opportunities to monetize restricted. The company will also start a new initiative from today to understand how users decide whether or not information is accurate based on the news source.

108,2017-12-22,What happens when your Facebook page is hijacked by a stranger  Recode's Ed Lee: I think Facebook is stepping away from news feeds  ,"You can't find Derek Kennedy, an emergency-room physician intern in Detroit, on Facebook.
 Nor will you find Mariah Prussia, a professional fighter and fitness center owner in North Dakota.
At least not under their own real names.
 Last summer, their Facebook accounts were hijacked and the passwords were changed, locking them out. 
Both could only watch as someone else posted videos and text on web pages they created and whose web addresses carried their names for months.
""I exhausted all the avenues,"" Kennedy, 30, told CNBC in a phone interview. ""I want answers and I want my account back.""
Says Prussia, ""Individuals should understand Facebook does not have a support number or very good follow-through when it comes to hacking.""
CNBC shared the web address of Kennedy's account with Eric Feinberg of the Global Intellectual Property Enforcement Center, which tracks and analyzes terrorism, hate speech and other illegal activity on social media worldwide.
Feinberg says he's not surprised by the hacks and pointed CNBC to YouTube videos with step-by-step instructions, in both English and Arabic, on how to hack into Facebook accounts.
""This is a cottage industry in the Middle East,"" Feinberg says. As for the hackers' motives, ""It's possible they (the hackers) can't have their own accounts under authoritarian regimes,"" he speculates.
A YouTube spokesperson said any videos that include such content would violate their terms of service, yet a search for them on Thursday turned up thousands of results.
 Syria and Turkey by way of Duke and Yale
 Kennedy says he realized he had a problem late on the night of July 13, 2017, when Facebook sent him an email alerting him that his password had been changed.
Within minutes, he says, he started receiving a slew of emails alerting him to friend requests from other Facebook users -- none of whom he knew and all of whom had Arabic names and lived in the Middle East.
Alarmed, he tried to log into his account but found the password already changed.
Then Kennedy tried to get in using his security questions. But those had already been changed to ones he described to CNBC as ""Muslim-related,"" which included an Islamic symbol and Arabic text.
""I'm a 34-year-old black man from Syracuse (New York). I don't have any ties that would have brought this on,"" he says.
Kennedy reported the hack to Facebook promptly via this page, he says, and shared with CNBC screen shots that support the claim.
In response, Facebook received what he described as a generic message, offering no instructions on how Kennedy could regain control of his account.
""Thanks for your report -- you did the right thing by letting us know about this,"" the message begins. ""We've looked over the profile you reported, and although it doesn't go against any of our specific Community Standards, we understand that the profile or something the person shared may still be offensive to you. We want to help you avoid things that you don't want to see on Facebook.""
The letter also says that Kennedy could ""block...unfriend or unfollow"" the person who stole his account.
""We know that these options may not apply to every situation, so please let us know if you see anything else that you think we should take a look at,"" the message concluded.
Kennedy then sent screen shots of his hacked account, and later had friends report the hack via this Facebook page. But the account stayed up.
""There's no email and no phone number (that was answered)"" Kennedy told CNBC by phone.
On Wednesday, CNBC checked the hacked page and found that even though the web address still had Kennedy's name on it, the page shows a user calling himself Hussein Saraj Ali.
According to the profile, Ali is from ""Alleppe, Harab, Syria"" and lives in ""Melikgazi, Kayseri, Turkey."" Ali has more than 200 Facebook friends, all of whom have names that are Arabic or Turkish.
 The imposter has never made contact with Kennedy, who said that he received a notice last year that his social security number and other personal data was stolen in the major hack of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management that was exposed in 2015.
""I guess someone needed a Facebook account and my password was floating around out there,"" he says.
After CNBC alerted Facebook to the account and asked for comment, a company spokesperson pointed us to several help pages, including ones here and here, that offer tips on how to keep an account secure. The most important thing a person can do when hacked, Facebook says, is to visit facebook.com/hacked immediately.
""This information can help keep them in control of their accounts,"" a spokeperson wrote. ""For Kennedy, Prussia, and others, we continue to encourage them to follow the instructions at facebook.com/hacked.""
Facebook does offer one main safeguard against these kinds of hacks. If a user says their account was hacked, Facebook sends an email to the address originally associated with the account. The user can then click a link in that email to re-associate the account with their real email (instead of the impostor's).
In this case, Kennedy says, the hackers overtook his Yahoo email account along with his Facebook account, so that email was no help. 
 Another victim, another months-long ordeal
 The same misfortune befell Mariah Prussia of Fargo, North Dakota, whose personal Facebook account was hacked literally before her eyes. (There's another Mariah Prussia from Virginia, whose personal Facebook page was not hacked and can be found by search.)
Prussia, 40, owns a fitness center and teaches as an adjunct professor at Minnesota State University Moorhead, and has also fought in eight professional mixed-martial arts bouts.
 Before she was hacked, she had multiple Facebook pages: One personal, another for her business, MPX Fitness, and another page to promote her MMA fight career.
On June 6, Prussia was messaging a client via her business page when one of her marketing employees tried to update her MMA fan page and noticed something strange.
""She asked me if I had locked her out of the account by mistake,"" Prussia told CNBC in a phone interview. 
When Prussia went to look at the administrator page, she found that she had also been locked out. When she then tried to reload the page, she saw the text on it had changed to Arabic and the page was identified as belonging to a user named Nizar Sulaiman al-Sawair.
""They were fast. It was crazy how they deleted my (administrative access on one account) within seconds of hacking the other account.""
An email that Facebook sent to Prussia the same day alerted her that someone had reset her password from an IP address located in or near the town of Giza, in Egypt:
 Prussia says she clicked the ""secure your account"" link and got a code, but was unable to use it in time to restore access. 
Her MMA marketing page was saved by a quick-thinking IT worker who, still with administrative access, deleted the name of the hacker, also in Arabic, from the list of page administrators before the impostor could do the same (to the worker).
Still, Prussia was locked out of her personal and business pages for months. Although Facebook finally took the hacked pages down, she says, she had to create a new business page with a different name, MPX Fitness Fargo.
That hurt her marketing efforts because she lost contact with the followers of her original business account.
""This is my livelihood,"" she says.
Like Kennedy, she was never able to regain access to her personal account even though she and several friends alerted Facebook to the problem.
""I emailed and reported my account on numerous occasions, as well as had other individuals report the issue,"" Prussia told CNBC in a Facebook message this week.
 Given that Facebook offered little help in resolving the situation, Prussia says she has learned an important lesson. She's added an extra layer of security to her two new accounts and the one that was saved from hackers.
""Two-factor security (authentication) is really important,"" she says, referring to optional security codes sent to users to confirm their logins.
After repeated attempts to create a new account in her real name, she finally created one using an alias, which she declined to share.
""I don't want Facebook or anyone else to take that one away,"" she says.

 Amazon is planning a push into digital advertising in 2018   
 11:19  AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  00:50 
 Amazon has been quietly experimenting with various advertising products across its portfolio and off its website, according to interviews with half a dozen ad buyers and technology partners. And it's getting ready to make waves in 2018.
 Most of the conversations are focusing on new ad opportunities on Amazon's e-commerce search and video products, sources say. 
The company is also looking to sell advertising beyond Amazon sites and products. For example, a source with knowledge about the situation says it is working with third-party mobile advertising companies such as Kargo to pair advertising on television and on mobile screens.

 12:56  PM ET Tue, 26 Dec 2017 |  04:34 
 Ad industry sources also say Amazon is stepping up hiring for its advertising division, especially in the New York area. CFO Brian Olsavsky noted that the company was hiring more ad sales staff on its  Q2 earnings call in July.
Amazon did not respond to requests for comment on its advertising business.
 Why Amazon wants in
 Digital advertising was a $209 billion business globally in 2017, according to media buying research firm Magna Global. And it's only increasing: The company predicts the industry will grow 13 percent to $237 billion next year. The U.S. is currently the most lucrative market, where advertisers spent $40.1 billion on digital advertising during the first half of 2017 alone, according to digital ad industry group Interactive Advertising Bureau.
Although Amazon doesn't break out revenues from its advertising business, eMarketer estimates Amazon was the fifth-largest digital advertiser in the U.S. in terms of revenue this year. Still, it makes up a little more than 2 percent of the market. It's leagues below industry leaders Google and Facebook, which take home more than 70 percent combined, according to a recent estimate from analysts at Pivotal.
But advertisers have been searching for a third large competitor in order to lower prices and force Google and Facebook to be more open about sharing user data. Amazon could be a major player, if only based on the sheer volume of consumer insights it has thanks to its robust e-commerce business. 
Two media buyers said Amazon showed some willingness to share more user data than Google and Facebook have traditionally — if the advertising budget was big enough. 
As a result, advertisers are welcoming Amazon with open arms, with one media buyer saying some of its consumer packaged goods clients already spend more on Amazon search ads than Google.
Another media buyer said that while Google is still the search ad category leader, Amazon is gaining ground and budgets are quickly shifting in its direction.
""Driving conversion and sales or creating very immersive high-impact branded content is what drives a lot of digital advertising revenue,"" said Aaron Shapiro, CEO of advertising agency Huge. ""Amazon is a player in both those areas.""
 Amazon's expansion plans
 Amazon already allows companies to sponsor product listings so they will show up at the top of relevant search results in its store. It wants to expand, offering advertisers better data and algorithms to ensure its items get in front of the ideal customer. It's also selling custom pages with built-in video and stories to help advertisers' products stand out from the rest, such as this Acura ad.
 Companies can pay for sponsored listings, which ensure their products show up on the top of relevant search results.
 ""Amazon likes to talk about how 56 percent of product searches are coming through Amazon,"" said Diana Gordon, senior partner at media agency Mindshare. ""It's definitely a stat that causes advertisers to stand up."" 
If you remove the buy box on Amazon's site, it would rank in the top five of daily trafficked sites online, Gordon explained. Amazon can not only drive sales, it's becoming a place for people to read reviews.
""We know that consumers are using Amazon not only as retail, but also using it as product discovery and research,"" Gordon said. ""It could lead to making more purchases in brick-and-mortar stores."" 
Amazon also wants to expand video advertising business. In addition to allowing commercials on livestreamed content like it did on its Thursday Night Football streams this year, it's pitching companies on bespoke sponsored content. The branded videos would be created by established media publishers or by Amazon's own internal production team. Some ideas that are being floated around are creating infomercial-style videos for products with celebrity spokespeople.
""We have been having conversations of how do you take advantage of the video offering on Prime through digital advertising,"" said Sargi Mann, digital executive vice president at Havas Media Group. ""Instead of having superfluous ads, how can a brand have a part of that dialogue that is not advertising in its traditional form? I am always open and like to discuss new and innovative ways in media where ads can be more of an organic insertion."" 
In addition, the company has aspirations to expand advertising opportunities past owned-and-operated products. In December 2016, it launched cloud-based ad technology Transparent Ad Marketplace as a way for companies to buy display advertising on sites across the web. Header bidding services such as Transparent Ad Marketplace allow media buyers to bid on available advertising inventory before Google's DoubleClick can. Amazon wants to do more in the programmatic ad tech space, according to sources. 
The company is also looking to mobile ad technology partners to find ways to advertise across multiple devices. For example, it is in talks to work with Kargo to pair commercials with mobile ads, sources say. Theoretically, a sponsored product sold on Amazon would run during a TV show and then seconds later a viewer would be able to see a related ad on their mobile phone.
But Amazon has some disadvantages as it looks to take on pure-play advertisers Google and Facebook. In particular, working with Amazon causes conflict for some companies, since it is disrupting the way they traditionally sold products, forcing them to change strategies. 
""The reality is Amazon makes a lot of brands and companies nervous, and presence on Amazon is a necessary evil,"" said Thomas Choi, RPA chief product officer of media. ""For others in categories like automotive, it's going to replace the existing sales and purchase process. It's a little bit of a mixed bag about how brands perceive them.""

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
 Perhaps your college friend asked you to support her quarterly magazine for her birthday. Or maybe your neighbor nudged you to donate to his favorite food bank on “Giving Tuesday” the week after Thanksgiving. And then there’s that pesky public-health nonprofit you’ve been charitable to in the past.
If you’ve gotten on Facebook at all this year, you’ve probably been asked to give money. And if you’re like many users, your newsfeed became particularly overrun by fundraisers during the last month or so. (If you’re still overwhelmed, we’ve got a comprehensive guide to end-of-the-year charitable giving.)
How did we get here? And at what point did Facebook become a hub for this sort of thing?
 It all started innocuously enough — with a modest “Donate” button.
 How did Facebook get involved in fundraising?
 When Facebook rolled out the new button in 2013, it allowed people to contribute directly to nonprofits through the social media platform for the first time. At the outset, 19 organizations were listed as partners.
About two years later, officials began testing another new tool: fundraisers. Using that feature, in tandem with an improved donate button, about three dozen organizations now had a place from which they could raise money for a campaign. And by June 2016, Facebook announced it would expand its fundraisers tool to allow users themselves to raise money for more than 100 nonprofits in the United States.
Less than five months later, that group of 100 was expanded to more than 750,000. Facebook teamed up with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Together, they pledged to contribute up to $1 million to Facebook fundraisers — $500,000 from the foundation in matching funds and $500,000 in waived fees from Facebook.
But they weren’t done. In August, the company announced that users in the United States would be able to create fundraisers in honor of their birthdays.

A high point was Giving Tuesday 2017. The Tuesday after Thanksgiving in the United States has become a focal point for donations on social media in the past five years. In an apparent attempt to raise the bar, the Gates Foundation quadrupled its matching contribution this year to $2 million. Facebook covered all the fees for the day.
 What’s this about fees?
 Before the Giving Tuesday promotion, Facebook took a 5 percent cut of the donations, according to news media reports and archived versions of its informational pages.
When Giving Tuesday arrived, the company did away with the fees, and then, the next day, officials announced that those fees would be eliminated moving forward. (Donations made to personal fundraisers — like for a medical emergency — are still charged a 6.9 percent fee in the United States.)
 Do people like it?
 In interviews, some Facebook users worried that it would take too long for nonprofits to get their donations. Others groused that inviting friends to donate one by one was time consuming. And a few said they were confused about whether they would be charged a service fee.
Still, users overwhelmingly said they were amazed by the ease, simplicity and effectiveness of fundraising on Facebook. A Washington, D.C., woman said she started a fundraiser by accident and raised almost $500 in hours. Many said they were stunned by the number of people who donated — particularly extended family members — even though they are seldom in touch.
Kelly Hewitt, 31, of Chicago, saw the banner advertising the Gates Foundation match this year and decided to open her first fundraiser. So many donations poured in that Hewitt had to increase her fundraising goal — twice.
“I do think it’s a really powerful tool that connects people,” she said of Facebook. “If it can be leveraged to do something great like this, then I don’t know why we wouldn’t use it.”
 Is Facebook’s effort part of a bigger plan?
 In its news releases and presentations, Facebook has framed the development of its fundraisers as part of a broader effort to do “social good.”
Experts said that may be true. But they say there is almost certainly another motivation, too.
Keith A. Quesenberry, an assistant professor of marketing at Messiah College in Mechanicsburg, Pa., said the social network needs to increase the amount of time users spend on its site if the company hopes to keep increasing its revenue. That’s part of the reason Facebook has pushed native video, and probably part of the reason it built a platform that allows users to donate without leaving the site, he said.
Fund-raising platforms such as GoFundMe have always relied on social networks to make campaigns successful, added Jeremy Littau, an associate professor at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., who studies social networks and civic action.
“This is Facebook deciding they’re no longer happy playing a middleman role,” he said.
Both Quesenberry and Littau said they consider Facebook’s decision to eliminate the donation fee to be a bold business move aimed at taking more market share and potentially putting competitors out of business.
“Any features that are popular on other networks, they just end up adopting,” Quesenberry said of Facebook.
The company did not respond to multiple emails seeking comment.
 How do competitors feel?
 A spokeswoman for GoFundMe, which claims to be the world’s largest social fundraising platform, said in an email that its community has continued to grow “despite new competition.”
That community includes more than 50 million people, the spokeswoman said.
GoFundMe does not charge what it calls a “platform” fee for new personal fundraising campaigns based in the United States. But it does charge an “industry-standard payment processing fee to accept credit cards” of 2.9 percent.
“In addition to growing our core business in the U.S., we are also rapidly expanding into new international markets as well as the charity fund-raising space,” the company spokeswoman, Kelly R. Galvin, said in a statement.
 Having it both ways
 Gabi Jubran, 28, of Menlo Park, Calif., was planning on running a Giving Tuesday campaign for the nonprofit organization he recently founded.
Since Jubran’s organization is in its infant stages, he worried about how long the money might stay in limbo if he used Facebook to raise funds. So he chose a different platform, Classy, and added a “Donate” button to his nonprofit’s Facebook page that redirected users to the alternative platform.
(Facebook says it takes about two weeks to pay out charitable organizations that are registered with the site’s payment system; it can take closer to six weeks to get a check to nonprofits that aren’t registered.)
Jubran soon found that when friends clicked the donate button on Facebook, the social network displayed a pop-up box forcing them to click again if they wished to leave. And when he posted a video about his organization on its Facebook page, Jubran discovered that although the video got more than 5,000 views, far fewer people departed Facebook to visit his nonprofit’s site.
Knowing all this, Jubran is now contemplating a change in strategy. Instead of raising money exclusively on Classy and ignoring Facebook fundraisers, he concedes, “I may end up just doing both.”

 });Frankie Celenza
 Fed up with overpriced university meal plans, Frankie Celenza decided to use his dorm, then later a shared loft in New York, as a test kitchen. 
 Years later, he's still teaching hungry young adults how to feed themselves on a budget. His Facebook series ""Struggle Meals"" from digital media company Tastemade shows viewers how to create $2 dishes, and has been viewed more than 6.5 million times. And no, it's not boiling an onion in water every day. His dishes range from buttermilk fried chicken to pizza to zucchini fettuccine. 
 ""Instagram stories in particular enable me to cook big meals for my family and friends without thinking about lighting or cameras,"" Celenza said.
 ""It brings them into my kitchen. The double whammy is that it's inspiring to watch a lot of things being cooked at once, it makes my fans think 'I could do that'! And that's exactly the point, they can!""
Celenza, a native New Yorker, grew up spending summers in Italy with family friends. He quickly learned how to whip up grub with just local ingredients and no recipe books.
When he started attending New York University in 2005, he was surprised at price of the required meal plan in the dorms. Currently, the minimum requirement costs more than $15 each meal. So he began making dinners for his friends using the dorm's facilities, then eventually moved to a rent-controlled loft, where he and his roommates built a kitchen.
Though Celenza was studying music production, he realized he loved cooking. Upon graduation, he started ""Frankie Cooks"" on YouTube, which taught people how to make quick recipes. He soon found there were too many YouTube cooking shows. To stay competitive, he decided to move his show to local access TV on NYCLife. Through the course of 19 half-hour shows, he focused on showing New York's expansive cuisines. The shows were later cut up and shown on YouTube.
Eventually, Celenza caught the eye of Tastemade, which hired him to make sponsored content and a series. He's since worked with the company on projects for Starbucks, Pepsi and Avocados From Mexico, and was one of two chefs invited to cook with Michelle Obama at the White House.
Coming full circle from his dorm days, Celenza's latest Tastemade show, ""Struggle Meals,"" focuses on low-budget easy dishes. He counts the cost of ingredients down to the pennies' worth of olive oil to keep each serving under $2. His tricks include buying larger items, like cutting a whole chicken into several parts, and using dry bulk goods. He also uses free take-out packets of ketchup, salt, pepper, honey, red pepper flakes and soy sauce to add more flavor.
Everyone can make a hearty meal with some sort of fat like an oil, starch like rice or pasta and an aromatic like onion or garlic, Celenza points out. These items are shelf-stable and relatively cheap, so you don't need to go to a grocery store every day. There's really no excuse to avoid cooking, he said.
""To those who say they can't cook: Can you physically not do it?"" Celenza said. ""That's the only legitimate excuse for not being able to cook. Give it a shot, maybe you'll fail — it's no big deal, do it again. We're humans, we learn to do everything from repetition and persistence, nothing more, nothing less. Plus, you'll have an excellent skill for life, so there's really no downside to learning to cook.""

110,2017-12-28,History shows Netflix and Facebook are the FAANG stocks to own to start 2018 with a bang  ,"show chapters
 Where are FAANG stocks heading in 2018?   
 5:03  AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  04:39 
 Netflix and Facebook could be the best so-called FAANG stocks for investors at the start of the year.
 FAANG refers to Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet. These stocks have seen big rallies this year.
Using data analytics platform Kensho, CNBC looked at the performance of the FAANGs if you bought them on the last trading day of December and sold the stock on the last trading day in January. 
 The average return if you did this since December 2012 is shown below and was calculated to see which of these names historically has a strong start to the year. 
 Netflix
 Netflix has beaten analyst estimates in the December quarter each time since the fourth quarter of 2012, according to data from Kensho. This could be one reason why the stock does well at the start of the year. 
Analysts are estimating earnings per share of $0.42 in the December quarter, and if Netflix beats this then the stock, which is up over 52 percent this year, could continue to rally. 
But ""there is a little more headwind to Netflix competitively going into 2018 more than going into any other year,"" according to Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights. 
Amazon is of course ramping up its spend on original content, while Disney's recent deal to buy Twenty-First Century Fox's assets has bolstered the company's streaming ambitions. Apple, Facebook and HBO have all talked up the potential of original content too. 
Meanwhile Netflix is continuing to increase its spending on original productions, creating a content war. But Netflix, which is seen as having first-mover advantage, has continued to expand internationally, and this will be the key for it holding its leadership position. 
""If they are successful expanding internationally they have strong tailwinds going into 2018.They have built an iron fence around the consumer landscape domestically, and all signs are pointing towards the international strategy hitting the ground running,"" Ives told CNBC in a phone interview. 
Still, not all analysts think Netflix is safe. Needham analyst Laura Martin told CNBC in November that ""Netflix should be scared to death"" with the competition. 
 Facebook
 Facebook has had a testing year. It was slammed for its role in letting Russian-backed ads on its platform which reached 126 million Americans in a bid to sway the outcome of 2016's election. 
As a result of this, and the increasing amount of ""fake news"" on the social network, Facebook has been hiring hundreds of people to try to monitor what is posted. Chief Financial Officer David Wehner forecast this year that with investments in original content and higher security costs, Facebook could see operating expenses rise between 45 percent and 60 percent in 2018.
Despite the rocky year, Facebook has continued to grow its user base to over 2 billion, and its stock is up over 54 percent year-to-date. Analysts are still positive on Facebook's ability to engage and monetize users thanks to two products: video and Instagram. 
Facebook recently revamped the ""Watch"" tab on its site which hosts original video content. The Wall Street Journal reported in September that Facebook is ""willing to spend as much as $1 billion"" on original video content. This will help drive engagement, analysts at Jefferies said in a note last week, reaffirming its ""buy"" rating on the stock. 
Facebook is also beginning to monetize the fast-growing user base of Instagram, the photo-sharing app it bought for $1 billion in 2012. Evercore ISI analyst Anthony DiClemente said Facebook could lead the surge in the FAANGs next year. 
 Alphabet
 Like Facebook, Alphabet has had a tricky year on the regulatory front. Google was hit with a 2.4 billion euro ($2.7 billion) antitrust fine by European Union (EU) regulators in relation to its shopping service. The EU is also looking into its Android mobile operating system to see if that breaks any rules. 
Regulation remains a risk going into 2018, analysts said. But the stock is up over 34 percent year-to-date and there is still big growth potential for a number of areas.
In 2017, for the first time, mobile will represent more than half of Google's total U.S. ad revenue, according to eMarketer. This means that Google is continuing to grow in mobile. Meanwhile its YouTube video service continues to excite investors.
""YouTube continues to be the crown jewel from the ad point of view. People are spending 43 minutes a day and that is increasing into 2018,"" Ives told CNBC.
In a note at the end of November, MKM Partners said Alphabet ""has the most hidden value of all mega-caps,"" citing YouTube and its Maps products as big areas that can be further monetized. 
 Amazon
 It may be surprising that Amazon on average has a fairly quiet performance in the first month of the year given the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in November as well as the Christmas shopping period.
But usually, the impact hasn't been priced in by the end of January.
So far, there have been a number of positive noises made about Amazon's holiday performance. Ives said his research indicates that Amazon captured between 45 percent to 50 percent of all holiday online retail sales versus 38 percent during the holidays season in 2016. Prime members were spending 22 percent more than a year ago too. 
""Prime growth remains the key jewel for Amazon going forward as cross- selling around Whole Foods customers and putting up more walls/barriers around its growing Prime customer base is a major ingredient in Amazon's ability to fend off competition in 2018 and beyond,"" Ives said in a note on Wednesday.
Amazon also continues to show strong growth in its Amazon Web Services cloud businesses. And a number of analysts have forecast that the company could push further into healthcare. CNBC reported earlier this week that Amazon is also experimenting with various advertising products across its portfolio and off its website, to challenge Facebook and Google. 
Bullishness around the stock could see its value hit $1 trillion in the next year, Morgan Stanley said in a research note from November. 
 Apple
 It's been an exciting year for Apple. The U.S. technology giant released the iPhone X, the first radical redesign of its device in a long time. 
But it's also hit a few roadblocks with that same smartphone. There were long waiting times when it was first released, and on Tuesday, Taiwan's Economic Daily, citing unnamed sources, reported that Apple will slash its sales forecast for the iPhone X in the first quarter from 50 million units to 30 million.

 3:33  AM ET Wed, 27 Dec 2017 |  03:20 
 Still, many are convinced that the iPhone X will kick off an iPhone ""supercycle"" with demand pushed out into next year. At the same time, Apple's software and services division, which includes Apple Music and other services, continues to be strong and allows the company to monetize the large iPhone user base.
At the same time, Apple's performance in China, which is seen as a key market for future growth, has improved. 
The question for many investors now is what the next big thing for Apple will be. Ives said it's unlikely to be autos, but video streaming and original content could be a big deal if Apple decide to invest.
""What is the next magic silver bullet they will build their growth story around? The ones that make the most sense is streaming content on the video side,"" Ives said.

111,2017-12-29,Facebook A.I. researchers figured out how to make avatars look like they're playing music  ,"Getty Images
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook artificial intelligence researchers have come up with a novel way to make cartoonish avatars look like they're really playing musical instruments. The work could lead to fascinating augmented reality or virtual reality experiences in the future.
 In a new paper, Facebook research scientists Eli Shlizerman and Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman and collaborators Lucio Dery and Hayden Schoen talk about how they trained AI systems using YouTube videos of piano and violin recitals. They then used the trained systems to make avatars move their hands and fingers with fake instruments based solely on audio recordings, with the help of Apple's ARKit AR software for developers. 
Teaching machines to understand how people move is an active area of AI research and one that has been explored by researchers at other technology companies, including Google and Microsoft. But generally, that requires video feeds. The achievement here was to try to act on audio alone — even if the results weren't perfectly realistic.
 ""We believe the correlation between audio to human body is very promising for a variety of applications in VR/AR and recognition,"" the researchers wrote.
Facebook continues to push VR through its Oculus branch, including with the Spaces app that represents users with avatars, and earlier this month the company gave developers new tools to build AR features for Facebook's apps. 
The researchers believe that they could improve the accuracy of the avatars in the future partly by tapping MIDI files from people playing music, or data from sensors hooked up to musicians.

 Founders Fund, run by Peter Thiel, a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, has bought millions of dollars in bitcoin, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the situation. 
 Bitcoin rose more than 13.5 percent to near $15,017, according to Coinbase, amid the report. As bitcoin's price climbed, trading in the Cboe bitcoin futures was also briefly halted in accordance with pre-set rules. 
The venture capital firm bought about $15 million to $20 million of bitcoin, and told investors that after bitcoin's surge in the last year, those holdings are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, the newspaper said. It wasn't clear whether Founders had sold any of its holdings, the report said.

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook in July 2017
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his mission in 2018 is to fix Facebook's large list of issues, including foreign interference on the platform, ongoing instances of harassment and potential threats to the mental health of its users.
 ""My personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a post on his Facebook page Thursday. ""We won't prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools. If we're successful this year then we'll end 2018 on a much better trajectory.""
Facebook was under much scrutiny in 2017 for a litany of issues, including admitting Russians bought ads with the intent to sway the 2016 U.S. elections. Its ad-targeting capabilities were also allowing companies to find potential customers using racially discriminatory and derogatory terms. 
 Facebook is facing four major challenges as it matures as a company, said Aaron Shapiro, CEO of advertising agency Huge. The company needs to find its role in society, address mental health issues, assuage users' privacy concerns and remain relevant while growing revenue. But while Facebook has done a good job at acquiring companies like Instagram, it's never really addressed the other issues until now, Shapiro said. 
The most pressing issue Facebook has to address is fixing its ""fake news"" problem, said Ronn Torossian, founder and CEO of public relations firm 5WPR. His firm does crisis management for major technology companies. 
""We're living in an era where the president of the United States — arguably the most powerful person in the world — speaks about fake news as an issue every day,"" Torossian said. ""If you have a report coming out that says Facebook was a big purveyor of this fake news, you need to fix this thing."" 
Zuckerberg — who has taken on a personal challenge every year since 2009 — said in his post that one of the most interesting issues facing the technology industry is the concept of ""centralization vs. decentralization."" Technology was expected to give people more control over their lives, he wrote. But as a handful of technology companies become the dominant players and governments used technology to monitor citizens, people increasingly believe technology is becoming a controlling, centralized power. 
""There are important counter-trends to this — like encryption and cryptocurrency — that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""But they come with the risk of being harder to control. I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.""
The fact that Facebook is used by more than a billion people on a daily basis makes it both an ideal communication tool and an easy way to spread misinformation, said eMarketer principal analyst Debra Aho Williamson. People see major tech companies as having vast control over their lives, and Facebook will have to learn how to balance its influence with public perception.
""Recognizing its power, and understanding how that power can be used for both good and potentially bad purposes and doing something about that is probably Facebook's biggest challenge,"" Williamson said.
The fact that Zuckerberg is acknowledging the problems is admirable and positive, 5WPR's  Torossian said. And saying he'll do so on his Facebook page is an intelligent move. 
""It's PR 101. ... He doesn't have to do an interview. He doesn't have to shout it from the rooftops. All he has to do is put it out on Facebook, and he controls the message,"" Torossian said.
See the full text of Zuckerberg's post below:
 ""Every year I take on a personal challenge to learn something new. I've visited every US state, run 365 miles, built an AI for my home, read 25 books, and learned Mandarin. I started doing these challenges in 2009. That first year the economy was in a deep recession and Facebook was not yet profitable. We needed to get serious about making sure Facebook had a sustainable business model. It was a serious year, and I wore a tie every day as a reminder. Today feels a lot like that first year. The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do -- whether it's protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent. My personal challenge for 2018 is to focus on fixing these important issues. We won't prevent all mistakes or abuse, but we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools. If we're successful this year then we'll end 2018 on a much better trajectory. This may not seem like a personal challenge on its face, but I think I'll learn more by focusing intensely on these issues than I would by doing something completely separate. These issues touch on questions of history, civics, political philosophy, media, government, and of course technology. I'm looking forward to bringing groups of experts together to discuss and help work through these topics. For example, one of the most interesting questions in technology right now is about centralization vs decentralization. A lot of us got into technology because we believe it can be a decentralizing force that puts more power in people's hands. (The first four words of Facebook's mission have always been ""give people the power"".) Back in the 1990s and 2000s, most people believed technology would be a decentralizing force. But today, many people have lost faith in that promise. With the rise of a small number of big tech companies — and governments using technology to watch their citizens — many people now believe technology only centralizes power rather than decentralizes it. There are important counter-trends to this --like encryption and cryptocurrency -- that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands. But they come with the risk of being harder to control. I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services. This will be a serious year of self-improvement and I'm looking forward to learning from working to fix our issues together.""

 Facebook will chip away at Google's dominance in digital advertising thanks to the growth of Instagram and video ads, according to a new research note from Cowen.
 Cowen analysts, who surveyed 50 senior ad buyers, said Facebook and Instagram ad budgets will increase in 2018 and 2019, and budgets for Google ads will decline slightly. 
Google and Facebook together dominate digital advertising, with about 63 percent between the two of them in 2017, according to eMarketer. This year, the firm projects Google will make $40.08 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue, while Facebook is poised to bring in $21.57 billion. 
 Though YouTube is still the preferred digital video platform to advertise on, Facebook is encroaching on its top position. In particular, 41 percent of the survey takers considered Facebook video the best place to launch a new ad campaign over TV (25 percent) and YouTube (10 percent). While the digital ad market is expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 13 percent between 2018 and 2023, Google is only expected to increase 11 percent.
There was also increasing interest in advertising on Snapchat-like service Instagram Stories, with ad buyers saying they preferred Instagram Stories over Snapchat.
Both Facebook and Google shares are expected to outperform, with Facebook's price target at $220 and Alphabet's at $1,230.

 Mark Zuckerberg is studying up on cryptocurrency   
 8:17  PM ET Thu,  4 Jan 2018 |  01:06 
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed his interest in crypto currency and its potential uses in his 2018 mission statement, issued on Thursday. 
 The statement was all about how Zuckerberg is taking on a new personal challenge for 2018: fixing Facebook. (Last year's challenge was visiting all the states he'd never been to and meeting people there.) 
Zuckerberg mentioned cryptocurrency only in passing as an example of technology that decentralizes power. But the concept could also help Facebook catch up to Asian messaging rivals when it comes to mobile payments. 
 In China, it is so easy to make purchases with WeChat Pay and AliPay that cash is becoming obsolete. In Chinese cities, beggars seek mobile payments to their accounts using QR codes rather than spare change. 
Combined, Alibaba and WeChat hold an estimated 92 percent of the marketshare for mobile wallets in China, which has an estimated 500 million mobile payment users. The rest of the world has some 556 million mobile money accounts, according to research from finance industry consortium CGAP.

 Zuckerberg says fixing Facebook is his personal challenge for 2018   
 5:19  PM ET Thu,  4 Jan 2018 |  01:05 
 By contrast, Facebook's payment features haven't really taken off. 
Through Facebook payments, users can link their Messenger account to a debit card, and pay friends with a quick message, or make an e-commerce purchase via Messenger and Marketplace on Facebook. 
Facebook has already signaled at past F8 developer conferences that it will expand its payments business conservatively, to include bill payment and investing options, which those WeChat Pay and Alipay have offered for years.
According to Mark Højgaard, CEO and co-founder of Coinify, a tech firm helping businesses accept payments via crypto, ""It definitely makes sense for Facebook users globally to send some kind of token to each other. This could be currency or something else like points that you can redeem them for things within the Facebook ecosystem, like premium content."" 
 The Chinese government has, for the time being, banned ICO's and forced domestic crypto currency exchanges to close shop. So Facebook could get an early edge on its overseas competitors by moving fast to build a crypto wallet or issue a possible Facebook coin.
Here's the relevant part of Zuckerberg's post:
 With the rise of a small number of big tech companies — and governments using technology to watch their citizens — many people now believe technology only centralizes power rather than decentralizes it. There are important counter-trends to this --like encryption and cryptocurrency -- that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people's hands. But they come with the risk of being harder to control. I'm interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services.

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook in July 2017
 Facebook M, the text-based virtual assistant that  used human workers to train an artificial intelligence system, is ending the human-assisted part of the service after two and a half years. The human-enhanced version of M, which was available through a bot on Facebook Messenger, only ever became available to about 2,000 people living in California. The final day of the will be January 19th, Facebook said, and contractors who worked on it will be offered other jobs at the company.
First introduced in August 2015, aspects of the service will live on through  M suggestions, which offers fully automated suggestions for payments, making plans, and sending stickers through Messenger. When it launched, Facebook described M as a ""beta"" and suggested the human-powered assistant would come to more users over time. But it never did. Upon shutting down the human-powered M, Facebook described it as an ""experiment.""
""We launched this project to learn what people needed and expected of an assistant, and we learned a lot,"" the company said in a statement. ""We're taking these useful insights to power other AI projects at Facebook. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of M suggestions in Messenger, powered by our learnings from this experiment.""
 I got access to M in October 2015, and used the service only about three dozen times over its lifespan. It felt like an amazing resource to have at my disposal, and yet in practice I almost never knew what to do with it. In most cases, I used M only when I knew that doing so would save me from making a phone call — because M would be making it for me. When I mentioned this to Mark Zuckerberg in an interview, he responded, ""I think that's probably not very different from other people.""
That could speak to why Facebook had trouble making M more widely available. Fin, a new virtual-assistant startup founded by a former Facebook executive that closely mirrors the M service, charges a minimum of $120 to complete a task. Facebook lightly experimented with pushing recommendations to users through M — it asked me if I wanted to send flowers to anyone on Valentine's Day in 2016. It's possible to imagine a world where M was more successful at commerce, and was able to take a cut of revenue, defraying some of the costs of maintaining an around-the-clock service.
But bot-based commerce has been slow to take off, as most people continue to prefer native apps and the web over sending text messages. In the meantime, the M project taught Facebook about the range of tasks that people would use a virtual assistant to complete, and Facebook automated the tasks that it could. Having free access to an on-call virtual assistant always seemed to be a little too good to be true. And so I'll miss having M around, though not quite as much as I would have imagined when I first got access to it.

Whatsapp CEO Jan Koum
 Facebook's top executives sold more than $4 billion worth of company shares last year — more than twice the amount of their counterparts at other giant technology firms — the total value boosted by a 52 percent surge in the company's stock price in 2017.
 The data comes from filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission throughout the year.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg's 24 sales, part of a plan executed throughout the year, netted $942.5 million as the stock outperformed the broader market for tech shares by a wide margin. 
 Most of his proceeds went to fund a philanthropy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, founded with wife Priscilla Chan.
Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg sold $316 million worth of shares, with all of her sales coming in the first half of 2017.
Another insider at the company sold even more. Jan Koum, co-founder of WhatsApp and a Facebook board member, made 16 sales throughout 2017 worth a whopping $2.8 billion.
That's the most of any top executive at the five most valuable U.S. tech firms.
The only other tech leader to sell anywhere close to that amount of stock was Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who sold $2 billion worth. Bezos said in April that he sells about $1 billion a year in Amazon stock to help fund his space exploration project, Blue Origin.
Other notable sellers among the big five tech firms this year included Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who's cashed in $84.3 million of Alphabet shares, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, who sold $60 million of that stock.
Notably, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sold no shares last year, nor did Alphabet CEO Larry Page.  
Here's a list of the top-selling Facebook executives for 2017:
 Jan Koum, CEO, WhatsApp, director - $2.825 billion Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and chair - $942 million Sheryl Sandberg, COO, director - $316.3 million Michael Schroepfer, CTO - $70.98 million Chris Cox, chief product officer - $59.8 million David Wehner, CFO - $14.1 million 
The majority of these Facebook sales were made via regular trading plans filed with the SEC.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers a keynote address at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain.
 In an age of Alexa, Cortana, the Google Assistant and Siri, Facebook wanted to provide the world with an assistant that could do more. In 2015 the company launched M in its Messenger chat app.
 M wasn't just another chatbot that was trained to provide text responses based on previous conversations, using artificial intelligence. It had the power to take care of practically any task, as long as it wasn't illegal, because people were really doing the work. It was limited in its deployment, with M being made available to around 2,000 people, the Verge said, out of 1.3 billion Messenger users. 
Last year Facebook altered M by introducing automatic actions and responses into Messenger conversations for millions of people. And on Monday, the company finally did away with the human-powered version of M altogether.
 Relative to Facebook's expansive use of AI, M assistant was never very significant. Every day, for billions of people, Facebook counts on AI to make sense of text, speech, photos and videos.
Here's an incomplete list of ways Facebook uses AI at a bigger scale than the full-blown M assistant.
 Predicting reasonable responses to messages users receive in Facebook Messenger. Blocking offensive comments on Instagram posts. Stabilizing photos and videos that people post to Facebook. Figuring out which places people are referencing when they respond to friends' requests for recommendations in Facebook posts. Recognizing users' faces in photos posted to Facebook and informing them of it. Translating the text of posts that people publish on Facebook into different languages. Adding interesting visual effects to videos that people record using the camera in Facebook's mobile apps. Coming up with captions for the words people say in video ads that companies post to Facebook. Identifying the most relevant ""On This Day"" memories to show to users in their news feed. Removing content posted to Facebook from terrorist groups. Spotting Facebook posts and Facebook Live videos that could indicate a user is having suicidal thoughts. Filtering out Facebook ads and posts that lead to content that's not what it seems to be. Writing out captions for photos that people share on Facebook so their visually impaired friends can better understand the content. Ranking posts that will appear in each user's news feed. Determining the best ads to show to Facebook users. Selecting the right types of Facebook content to search through when a user types in the search box. 
Facebook first established its AI research lab in 2013, and the company has continued to hirefor it. With that commitment, Facebook's use of AI is only going to increase.

Hugo Barr, VP of VR at Facebook
 Facebook said Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi will make the hardware for its upcoming Oculus Go virtual-reality headset.
 Xiaomi is also building a product called the Mi VR Standalone for the Chinese market based on Go technology and powered by a Qualcomm processor. Executives from the three companies presented at an event at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
""Xiaomi is our hardware partner for launching Oculus Go globally,"" Hugo Barra, a former Xiaomi executive who was hired by Facebook a year ago as vice president of VR, said on Monday.
 In a blog post, Oculus called Xiaomi's device ""a VR headset based on Oculus technology exclusively for the Chinese market"" and said the product will support Oculus's mobile software developer kit.
China requires foreign companies in certain strategic markets to partner with Chinese firms to sell products there.  The partnership could help Facebook get its VR technology and Chinese versions of Oculus content into the world's largest consumer market.
Facebook said at its Oculus Connect conference in October that it will begin shipping Go, the company's first standalone headset, in early 2018, at a price of $199.
Unlike other VR devices, standalone headsets don't need to be attached to a PC or smartphone to work.
Xiaomi was the world's fifth-largest maker of smartphones in the third quarter of 2017, according to a report from market researcher IDC. The company is the top vendor in India.
-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

 Facebook users can now include Sony/ATV music in their video clips — and musicians will get paid royalties for their use. 
 The two companies said on Monday that they inked a licensing deal that would give users access to Sony/ATV's catalog of more than 3 million songs for use in any video posted to Facebook's platforms — including Instagram and Oculus. The deal means musicians would earn royalties from music posted there. Terms were not revealed. 
The move is a challenge to Alphabet's YouTube, which has become one of the main vehicles through which listeners discover new music. (YouTube already has deals with Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group.)
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called video a ""mega trend,"" and the company has been actively trying to get more users and companies to use its platform for video with initiatives such as premium video feature Watch. Giving users the ability to use licensed music increases the appeal. (Facebook signed a deal with music publisher Universal Music Group in December.)
""We're excited to work with the largest music publisher in the world to bring amazing songs which deepen connections between friends and fans,"" Tamara Hrivnak, Facebook's head of music business development and partnerships, said in a statement. 
Sony/ATV is one of the world's largest music publishers, with songs by Drake, Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Kanye West, The Beatles, Bob Dylan and Queen in its repertoire. 
More videos can also potentially boost revenue for Facebook, especially as its ad load increases. Facebook's Watch alone will bring in $565 million in revenue in 2018, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak. Facebook is also gearing up to test six-second ads before videos this year.

 Facebook is reportedly entering the hardware business with a home device for video calling, according to a report from finance outlet Cheddar.
 The Portal home device would act primarily as a video phone, in line with Facebook's long-time mission of connecting friends and relatives, but would also allow access to streaming services like Spotify and Netflix, Cheddar reported.
The Portal device is rumored to cost $499 — significantly more than comparable devices like the Amazon Echo Show, which sells for $230 — and will start shipping in the second half of 2018, according to Cheddar.
 It marks another entrant into the increasingly crowded voice-activated space and will have some stiff competition in Amazon's Alexa-enabled devices, the Google Home, and Apple's HomePod. 
Facebook did not immediately return request for comment from CNBC.

 Admitting you have an addiction is Step 1.
 We need to control our own environment & we need information:
 Apple Watches, Google Phones, Facebook, Twitter - they've gotten so good at getting us to go for another click, another dopamine hit. They now have a responsibility & need to start helping us track & manage our digital addictions across all usages - phone, laptop, TV etc.
 They're the only ones who can do this -
 They need to give access to that information to 3rd-party apps, so that we can manage & limit our time on them, control notifications, etc. There will a lot of great startups that will create useful tools to help us become balanced - digital & analog - again…
 With (or without) these tools, it's up to us to act:
 The comments from Fadell come as consumer addiction to technology is top of mind.
Two prominent investors in Apple — Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs — sent a letter to the Cupertino-based tech behemoth on Saturday pointing out the extent to which young people are addicted to their smartphones. (Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, or Calstrs own $2 billion worth of Apple stock.)
""More than 10 years after the iPhone's release, it is a cliché to point out the ubiquity of Apple's devices among children and teenagers, as well as the attendant growth in social media use by this group. What is less well known is that there is a growing body of evidence that, for at least some of the most frequent young users, this may be having unintentional negative consequences,"" the letter says.
Apple has responded to the letter. Since 2008, parental controls have been available for many Apple products, the company points out.
""Apple has always looked out for kids, and we work hard to create powerful products that inspire, entertain, and educate children while also helping parents protect them online. We lead the industry by offering intuitive parental controls built right into the operating system,"" Apple says in a statement shared with CNBC Make It.
""We think deeply about how our products are used and the impact they have on users and the people around them. We take this responsibility very seriously and we are committed to meeting and exceeding our customers' expectations, especially when it comes to protecting kids.""
Apple did not respond to the claim that adults are also addicted to their technology.
Twitter declined to comment. 
Facebook and Google had not responded to request for comment by the time this story was published.
Fadell pressed Apple to respond to the claim for adults, too.
Indeed, Adam Alter, an associate professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, wrote a book, ""Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked,"" making the case that in addition to kids, adults are addicted to technology.
""We're biologically prone to getting hooked on these sorts of experiences. If you put someone in front of a slot machine, their brain will look qualitatively the same as when they take heroin. If you're someone who compulsively plays video games — not everyone, but people who are addicted to a particular game — the minute you load up your computer, your brain will look like that of a substance abuser,"" Alter tells the New York Times. ""I find it interesting that the late Steve Jobs said in a 2010 interview that his own children didn't use iPads.""
Alter uses himself as an example: ""I'm addicted to email. I can't stop checking it. I can't go to bed at night if I haven't cleared my inbox. I'll keep my phone next to my bed, much as I try not to,"" says Alter.
""The technology is designed to hook us that way. Email is bottomless. Social media platforms are endless. Twitter? The feed never really ends. You could sit there 24 hours a day and you'll never get to the end. And so you come back for more and more,"" he tells the Times.
And according to Fadell's tweets, it's not hard to implement tools that would allow consumers to moderate their usage. He knows it, and so does Apple, he says.
 Thx to my friends @apple for your 1st response. It's not about only kids, adults need them for themselves too. U & I know it's technically EASY to build usage info & control tools. Looking fwd to many bold announcements @ WWDC in June on this imprtnt topic

 Trump: Any immigration solution has to include the wall   
 4:55  PM ET Wed, 10 Jan 2018 |  01:01 
 The chief executives of more than 100 major companies and trade organizations are sending a letter to congressional leadership Wednesday urging them to pass legislation by the end of next week protecting the status of undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children.
 IBM, General Motors, Facebook, Dropbox and Blackstone are among the companies backing the effort. The letter, which will also run as a full-page ad in national newspapers Thursday, estimates that allowing the program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, to expire would result in a $215 billion hit to the economy.
""The imminent termination of the DACA program is creating an impending crisis for workforces across the country,"" the letter states. ""Failure to act in time will lead to businesses losing valuable talent, cause disruptions in the workforce and will result in significant costs.""

President Donald Trump (2nd L) welcomes members of his American Technology Council, including (L-R) Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in the State Dining Room of the White House June 19, 2017 in Washington, DC.
 Companies are seeking action by Jan. 19 — the deadline for averting a government shutdown — even though DACA does not end until March 5. That would provide the Department of Homeland Security with critical breathing room to make any necessary administration changes, the companies argue.
""It will take time for the agency to implement any program outlined by Congress, underscoring the absolute urgency of the January 19th deadline,"" the letter states.
Corporate America has been a vocal advocate for a permanent pathway to citizenship for the program's roughly 700,000 undocumented immigrants, also known as ""Dreamers."" Silicon Valley giants including Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates founded a group called FWD.us to pressure lawmakers to act, bringing roughly 100 DACA recipients to Washington this week for congressional meetings and to rally for a fix.
The new push comes as immigration emerges as the flashpoint in negotiations between Congress and the White House to keep the government running beyond Jan. 19. Republican leadership has declared that the two issues will be addressed in separate legislation, but Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer has made a DACA deal a prerequisite for supporting a government spending measure.
""We should come up with a plan here that Democrats and Republicans can agree on in terms of DACA, add it to the large spending bill and get it done — and get it done quickly,"" Schumer said Tuesday.
Adding to the confusion was a California court ruling late Tuesday that halted the White House's phaseout of the program. Since the administration began winding it down in October, an estimated 122 DACA recipients have lost their protected status each day, according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank. Those immigrants will be able to apply for renewal while the California court reviews the merits of the underlying case.
""This ruling underscores why a permanent, legislative solution must be passed to remove the ambiguity and uncertainty around DACA,"" IBM said in a statement to CNBC on Wednesday. ""IBM urges Congress to act now to protect Dreamers across the country.""

 'Putting on the pressure' is the next step in combatting sexual harassment and equality: Tina Brown   
 11:06  AM ET Thu, 11 Jan 2018 |  04:35 
 Social media platforms and search engines like Facebook and Google have had an ""appalling"" influence on the media landscape, said former magazine editor Tina Brown.
 The media mogul spoke on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Thursday and said she is in favor of an ""industry-wide pressure"" for the companies to ""give back something"" and ""fund real journalism.""
""One of the great big scams of digital platforms is that they're able to kind of pretend that they care about the human good, while at the same time taking all the profits and all the revenue from people who are actually doing the work,"" said Brown, who is also the former editor of publications like Vanity Fair, The Daily Beast and The New Yorker.
 ""They use all that great work on their platforms and don't give anything back,"" she said. ""It's been a great scam. I'm glad they made out like bandits, but I think it's time they're viewed in the manner they should be.""

 Sites like Facebook and Google wreaked havoc on the media industry when they abruptly changed the business model by no longer requiring consumers to pay for content. Revenue made through advertising, once the main source of income for newspapers, quickly declined.
Across all media, the two companies account for as much as 73 percent of all digital advertising.
Last fall, Facebook wrote in a blog post that it is working with media outlets like The Washington Post, The Boston Globe and Economist to insert a paywall on Facebook and limit the number of free articles each month. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal already have similar models in place. 
""They have undermined the whole profession of journalism,"" Brown said on CNBC. Meanwhile, ""real journalist enterprises are struggling to get any advertising,"" she said.

 Facebook to overhaul news feed   
 10:32  AM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  03:55 
 Facebook is making a major change to its product to make sure that people feel like their time on the social network is ""well spent,"" the company announced Thursday evening.
 CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the platform's News Feed will start prioritizing ""meaningful social interactions"" versus ""relevant content,"" and that he expects the time people spend on the social network will go down as a result. 
""But I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable,"" he wrote. ""And if we do the right thing, I believe that will be good for our community and our business over the long term too.""
 Although Zuckerberg said the changes will take time to roll out, users will start noticing they see fewer posts from publishers and businesses and more content from their friends and family. Meanwhile, Facebook warns Pages that they will see their reach, referral traffic, and video watch time decrease.

 Facebook's own major video initiative, ""Watch,"" likely won't suffer though. A source briefed on the changes told Digiday that while Facebook will likely show fewer videos from publishers, it would would still be prioritizing its own scripted shows.
Although the company has made similar announcements in the past about tweaks to the News Feed, Zuckerberg described this change as a meaningful shift in the way the company runs.  
It's been a year of reckoning for the CEO: The company faced intense scrutiny for hosting fake news, harboring harassment, and having a negative effect on the mental health of users. He has said his resolution this year was to fix Facebook, and it looks like he sees this as a step in that direction.

 Investors bid Twitter shares higher Friday after Facebook said it would limit the number of news items it shows to its users.
 Twitter surged as much as 5 percent on heavier-than-usual volume as some bet that the move by its larger rival could open an opportunity for Twitter to sell more advertising.
""This is the best news we've heard for Twitter in a long time,"" Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki told CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report"" Friday.
 Twitter has struggled to grow as it's been squeezed by Facebook and Google, the top two sellers of online ads.
Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect that Twitter sales fell 5.3 percent last year to $2.4 billion, based on the average estimate of those who cover the stock. But analysts think its sales will rise 6.4 percent in 2018 to $2.55 billion.
Meanwhile, Facebook sales are seen surging 33 percent to $53.6 billion in 2018, while Google parent Alphabet is expected to post revenue of $131 billion, or year-over-year growth of 19 percent.
Facebook shares fell as much as 4 percent on heavier-than-usual volume after it said it would show fewer news items and videos in its News Feed, in favor of more content from users' friends.

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook in July 2017
 Facebook said it's going to limit the amount of news its users see soon.
 What it should really do is take news off the platform entirely.
We shouldn't be looking to a social media platform that established itself as a place to connect with friends and family to read about local, national and world events.
 There are several reasons why.
First, Facebook had already proved it isn't capable of splitting real news from fake propaganda, though at least it says it's working on it.
Second, it's using news as a business model — so much so that shares fell as much as 6.1 percent this morning after the changes were announced. It sells ads and promotes content from some publishers, which means it stands to make cash off of the most popular news stories ... no matter how accurate they are.
Sadly, that has led news organizations to use Facebook as a means to drive traffic, but not to create an established audience.
The Verge's Casey Newton hit the nail right on the head:
 read tweet
 Or this one, from The Information's Jessica Lessin, nails it again:
 tweet
 I remember, for example, that there used to be an easy way to game Facebook traffic to a news site simply by writing about any of the trending stories posted on the news feed. It drove crazy amounts of people to blogs and other organizations, but never people who came back.
And as for the fake news problem, Facebook even admits that earlier attempts to stop it from spreading actually did the exact opposite. In a blog post last month, Facebook product manager Tessa Lyons said that red flags that it posted next to stories that were meant to identify false news were actually doing the opposite.
""Academic research on correcting misinformation has shown that putting a strong image, like a red flag, next to an article may actually entrench deeply held beliefs – the opposite effect to what we intended,"" Lyons said. 
Yikes.
Facebook has forced the hands of some news organizations to change for the worse — pivoting to sometimes short but often unimportant videos about cats in pajamas instead of real topics, like what's on the front page of The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNBC, Bloomberg and other established first-rate news organizations.
Make no mistake: It would have devastating effects on sites that rely on Facebook for traffic and revenue. It'll also force publishers to get back to what we do best — what we're supposed to be doing in the first place — reporting first and generating traffic second (we do need to pay the bills after all, right?). It'll create new traffic that accumulates through an audience who wants to return because they expect high quality content. (Obviously, Facebook can't stop users from sharing news articles in their feeds.)
Otherwise we face another problem: The possibility of requiring some sort of government regulation of Facebook's news feed. That would help cut down on propaganda and fake news, but it also sets a dangerous precedent where the government might one day be able to regulate more of the news media, whether it's on Facebook or other platforms.
Facebook says it's moving away from news, and that's a step, but it's time for it to shut down the news operation entirely.

 });Even as executives from Google and Facebook prepare to testify in front of the Senate on how they're combating extremist content, the internet giants are struggling to keep it off their sites. 
 Dozens of accounts on sites owned by those two companies have been used this week to promote violent attacks and recruit people to the cause of Islamic terrorism, a CNBC investigation has found.
All of the content that was brought to the attention of Google and Facebook by CNBC was removed within 24 hours of notification. Yet many of the posts and videos, which contained graphic images and threats of violence, had been online for days or weeks before we alerted them to it.
 Its presence on their pages underscores the enormous challenge these internet firms have in controlling content while remaining open platforms.
""Terrorists are using Google and Facebook technology to run what are essentially sophisticated social media marketing campaigns,"" said Eric Feinberg, co-founder of the Global Intellectual Property Enforcement Center, or GIPEC, which tracks extremist content online.
Extremist groups are using their tools the way brand advertisers and other online marketers do, cross-promoting videos on one account with posts on other social media services.
Facebook, YouTube and Twitter are sending representatives to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday morning to testify in front of the Senate Commerce Committee in a hearing titled  ""Terrorism and Social Media: #IsBigTechDoingEnough?""
CNBC initially discovered some of the violent videos and posts while reporting an earlier story on Facebook users who had been locked out of their accounts by hackers.
After that story was published, CNBC reported its findings to counter-terrorism officials at the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco, because some of the content appeared to include coded messages about potential attacks over the Christmas holiday. 
The office acknowledged receipt of our e-mail and said it couldn't comment further. 
We then contacted GIPEC, a cyber-intelligence firm whose patented software finds social media activity produced by criminals and terrorists, and asked Feinberg if the group could locate more violent and extremist content.
""There's plenty out there if you know how to look for it,"" said Feinberg, who previously ran an online marketing and ad-tech firm based in New York. ""These companies are playing whack-a-mole"" in their fight against extremism, he said.
 How to make a bomb out of a 7-Up bottle
 Many of the Facebook accounts used to promote terrorist-related content appeared to have been taken over by hackers -- similar to those accounts in our prior story.
For example, they showed images of war-ravaged cities in the Middle East, or had flags from countries in the region, even though the profile page indicated the user was from a faraway place like Mexico or Brazil.
The pages also contained recent posts in Arabic while earlier posts on the profile had been exclusively in English or Spanish.
One page provided instructions for turning an empty soda bottle into an improvised explosive device (IED) like those used to kill and maim U.S. soldiers during conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 According to Google's online translation service, the Arabic text reads:
 ""An empty plastic box containing 15 yeast bags + 100 small size sharp nails. When the yeast is brewed after exposure to the sun, it will explode and the nails will spread splinters on the infidels. In the parks of the worshipers of the Cross."" 
Using Facebook's online reporting system, Feinberg notified the company of the page on Jan. 10, and it was soon removed.
Another page (which hasn't been reported) contains Islamist propaganda, including texts of speeches from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq who was killed by a U.S. airstrike in 2006. It's been up since at least Dec. 26.
Of the six profiles CNBC reported to Facebook on Wednesday afternoon, all were removed within a day.
In response to a request for comment as to why the pages hadn't been removed earlier, a Facebook spokesperson referred us to a November blog post titled,  ""Are we winning the war on terrorism online,""  from Monika Bickert, the company's global head of policy management.
""99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda-related terror content we remove from Facebook is content we detect before anyone in our community has flagged it to us, and in some cases, before it goes live on the site,"" the post said. ""Once we are aware of a piece of terror content, we remove 83% of subsequently uploaded copies within one hour of upload.""
Bickert is scheduled to appear before the Senate on Wednesday, alongside Juniper Downs, YouTube's global head of public policy and government relations, and Carlos Monje, Twitter's director of public policy and philanthropy.
 Promoting videos of an assassinated al Qaeda leader
 GIPEC found similar material on YouTube and Google Plus. 
One post, which violated Google's terms of service, pointed to videos made by Anwar al-Awlaki, an American of Yemeni descent who allegedly planned terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia before being killed by a drone strike in 2011.
 A YouTube spokesperson told CNBC that the company updated its rules last year to ban all content either promoted by or relating to individuals, including al-Awlaki, known to be members of the U.S. Department of State's list of foreign terrorist organizations.
YouTube published a blog post in December, saying that ""98 percent of the videos we remove for violent extremism are flagged by our machine-learning algorithms"" and that 70 percent is removed within eight hours of being uploaded. 
YouTube removed more than 150,000 videos for ""violent extremism"" between June and December of last year. The company sent CNBC the following statement:
 ""In June of last year we announced steps we are taking to combat violent extremism on YouTube, including better detection and faster removal of content, more expert partners to help identify content, and tougher standards. We've made progress with these efforts, with machine learning technology flagging content to help our reviewers remove nearly five times as many videos as they previously could. We're continuing to invest heavily in people, technology and strict policies to remove this content quickly.""  
While all six accounts we reported to Google were removed within 24 hours, other pages on the site still include terrorist propaganda.

 Make money with 'this time it's different'   
 6:49  PM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  00:51 
 Back in the day, CNBC's Jim Cramer would always hear that the four most dangerous words in the English language were ""this time it's different.""
 And when it came to market-rattling events like the dotcom bubble burst — when investors chased internet stocks to artificial highs hoping to catch the ""next big thing"" — that idea usually proved right.
""But honestly, I've now been at this business a pretty long time, and I'm beginning to wonder if the four most dangerous words about stock investing are 'this time it's the same,'"" the ""Mad Money"" host said on Friday.
 After watching big-cap tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet drive the market to new heights, Cramer argued that a ""this-time-it's-different"" mentality could've cost investors fortunes if they had applied it to the FANG names.
Investors would've kicked themselves if they were so shaken by the dotcom bubble that they avoided getting in on the Harvard-born craze that became the $521 billion Facebook, he said.
""You really had to believe this time it's different if you were going to buy some shares in some online retailer where you gave them your credit card information and actually trusted that they'd send you [product] overnight,"" Cramer said. ""But Amazon did become a $629 billion profitable company.""
""This time it's different"" would've made you rich if you believed in a money-losing company that rented out DVDs, because that company became the $95 billion giant that is Netflix, Cramer said.
""This time it's the same"" would've kept you from investing in a website that provides information based on anything you type, yet another dotcom name that eventually became Alphabet, the $782 billion parent of Google.
""The graybeards missed all of these stories because of their old saw,"" Cramer said. ""It stopped them from taking what turned out to be a calculated gamble on four companies that would have made fortunes for those who believed things really would be different this time.""

 Facebook just made a huge change to its News Feed   
 9:39  AM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  00:40 
 Facebook shares fell 4 percent Friday morning after it announced major changes to its News Feed Thursday night. 
 Shares fell as much as 6.1 percent ahead of the market open, after closing just below the flatline on Thursday. 
Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of the social media giant, said that the News Feed — one of the key areas of Facebook where advertising is placed — will start prioritizing ""meaningful social interactions"" versus ""relevant content."" Zuckerberg said this could mean that users spend less time on the social network. 
 Users will also see fewer posts from publishers and businesses. Investors are concerned that this could hit Facebook's advertising figures. 
Zuckerberg has been managing the fallout from revelations last year that Russians had tried to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election by buying ads and planting and promoting fake news stories. After initially dismissing those concerns immediately after the election, Zuckerberg later admitted he was wrong. Facebook eventually said that as many as 120 million people had viewed Russian-bought ads on the platform.
The company also acknowledged in December a study showing that certain uses of Facebook could worsen a user's mental health. That followed criticism by former Facebook executive  Chamath Palihapitiya, who said that same month that social media is ""starting to erode the social fabric of how society works.""
It's not the first time Zuckerberg has said the company would change the algorithm in the News Feed to move away from news, and emphasize content more relevant to individual users. In June 2016, Zuckerberg announced that intention in a blog post.
 The goal of News Feed is to show people the stories that are most relevant to them. Today, we're announcing an update to News Feed that helps you see more posts from your friends and family. 
Wall Street was not necessarily worried, though.
In a note released late Thursday, Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights said that while the News Feed change could be ""worrisome in terms of an ad growth hiccup,"" the overhaul was the right move in the longer term. Ives raised his price target on Facebook shares to $225 from $210, representing nearly 20 percent upside from Thursday's close. 
Suntrust Robinson also raised its price target on the stock to $240 from $215 on Friday. 
Most of Wall Street is bullish on Facebook's outlook for 2018. There are 17 ""strong buy"" ratings and 25 ""buy"" rating, according to Thomson Reuters data. Just three analysts have either a ""hold"", ""sell"" or a ""strong sell"" rating.

 Whoops, analyst downgrades Facebook stock hours after recommending it as shares tanked   
 2:04  PM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  00:47 
 One Wall Street analyst abruptly changed his view for Facebook shares within hours after seeing a big drop in the internet giant's stock price.
 Facebook announced on Thursday major changes to the company's News Feed. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the internet firm will start prioritizing ""meaningful social interactions"" versus ""relevant content,"" and that he expects the time people spend on the social network will go down as a result.
That prompted Stifel's Scott Devitt to reiterate his buy rating on the social media firm in a note to clients just after midnight Friday.
 ""We believe Facebook is doing the right thing for the long-term sustainability of the platform,"" he wrote. ""We believe Facebook shares will struggle until the long-term economic implications of the proposed changes become more clear.""
But he said in the note, ""We remain buy-rated on FB shares but with less conviction than any previous moment of our coverage.""

 Facebook to overhaul news feed   
 10:32  AM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  03:55 
 Then premarket trading began and the shares tumbled more than 5 percent as investors digested the news. 
Devitt then sent out a one paragraph note to clients shortly after 9 am ET, downgrading his rating to hold from buy.
""There is too much uncertainty relating to the economic impact of Facebook's pending News Feed changes for us to be comfortable retaining a Buy rating on the stock,"" Devitt wrote.
Facebook opened lower by 5 percent and was last down 4 percent during Friday trading.
Stifel was the only Wall Street firm to downgrade the stock in the wake of this news. Out of the 45 analysts that cover Facebook, just 5 say it is a hold or a sell. The other 40 say buy, according to FactSet.

 });How you use Facebook affects how you feel.
 So says Mark Zuckerberg, the billionaire tech titan who founded the social media behemoth.
When you use Facebook to talk to your friends and family, you feel better, says Zuckerberg, but when you use it to scroll through videos and posts passively, you don't, necessarily.
 ""The research shows that when we use social media to connect with people we care about, it can be good for our well-being. We can feel more connected and less lonely, and that correlates with long-term measures of happiness and health,"" Zuckerberg writes, in a post published to his personal Facebook page Thursday.
""On the other hand, passively reading articles or watching videos — even if they're entertaining or informative — may not be as good,"" Zuckerberg says.

 The comments about how to use Facebook productively came as the CEO announced a change in the algorithm that determines what users see in their newsfeeds. Facebook will, going forward, move away from showing posts from businesses, brands and media. Instead, Facebook will prioritize posts from friends and family in users' feeds.
""We feel a responsibility to make sure our services aren't just fun to use, but also good for people's well-being,"" Zuckerberg writes.
In the short-term, the change may mean users spend less time on the platform. But in the long-run, Zuckerberg says the change is better for the health of the company.
""Now, I want to be clear: By making these changes, I expect the time people spend on Facebook and some measures of engagement will go down,"" Zuckerberg says. ""But I also expect the time you do spend on Facebook will be more valuable. And if we do the right thing, I believe that will be good for our community and our business over the long-term, too.""
This is the second time in as many months Facebook has acknowledged that using the platform may not be good for you.

 Former employees explain why Facebook's secrets rarely leak   
 11:49  AM ET Mon,  6 Feb 2017 |  00:52 
 Last month, Facebook's director of research, David Ginsberg, and research scientist Moira Burke published a  blog post detailing how the way you use Facebook affects how you feel.
""In general, when people spend a lot of time passively consuming information — reading but not interacting with people — they report feeling worse afterward,"" the December blog post from Ginsberg and Burke reads. They cite a study from the University of Michigan and another from  UC San Diego and Yale, both of which demonstrated that users who used Facebook passively reported feeling worse afterward. 
""Though the causes aren't clear, researchers hypothesize that reading about others online might lead to negative social comparison — and perhaps even more so than offline, since people's posts are often more curated and flattering. Another theory is that the internet takes people away from social engagement in person,"" Ginsberg and Burke write.
Meanwhile, as Zuckerberg said Thursday, using Facebook to interact with specific people who you care about makes you feel better, they found.
""Actively interacting with people — especially sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions — is linked to improvements in well-being,"" Ginsberg and Burke write.

 Cramer Remix: This is the day to buy Facebook   
 7:10  PM ET Fri, 12 Jan 2018 |  01:12 
 After hours of marveling at the tape's incessant march higher, CNBC's Jim Cramer took a step back to check the market layout.
 ""What's driving it? ... Same as always: [a] stock shortage — it's really been acute in the industrials — 401(k) money being thrown at the market, animal spirits, a stronger consumer, tax reform, deregulation and a general revaluation higher,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Who's doing the leading? Once again, it's Boeing, it's Caterpillar, it's Adobe, it's Alphabet, it's Apple, and it's Netflix.""
Certainly, the layout can change. On Friday, shares of frequent market leader Facebook were taken down after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he wanted to change its News Feed to promote ""meaningful social interactions.""
 But Facebook's 4 percent decline failed to jolt the broader market, so Cramer gave investors his take on whether the social media giant's stock is worth buying into weakness.
""Yes, but you've got to wait,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Come Tuesday afternoon, it will probably make sense – Tuesday, market's closed Monday – to pick up some Facebook. By that point, the stock will have likely caught some more downgrades – this happened so quickly today they couldn't downgrade it.""
With that in mind, Cramer rattled off the stocks and events he's watching for his weekly gameplan.
 This time it's different

 Back in the day, Cramer would always hear that the four most dangerous words in the English language were ""this time it's different.""
And when it came to market-rattling events like the dotcom bubble burst — when investors chased internet stocks to artificial highs hoping to catch the ""next big thing"" — that idea usually proved right.
""But honestly, I've now been at this business a pretty long time, and I'm beginning to wonder if the four most dangerous words about stock investing are 'this time it's the same,'"" Cramer said on Friday.
After watching big-cap tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet drive the market to new heights, Cramer argued that a ""this-time-it's-different"" mentality could've cost investors fortunes if they had applied it to the FANG names.

 In February of 2016, Cramer started recommending the stock of Wynn Resorts, which was then trading at about $79 a share.
Since then, Wynn's share price has nearly doubled — making it one of S&P 500's best-performing stocks for 2017 — so Cramer thought it was worth revisiting some of the casino names.
""Remember, the two big worldwide casino stocks, Wynn and Las Vegas Sands, LVS, are very much plays not on the Nevada casinos, not on Vegas, but on Macau, the Chinese gambling haven,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
 Alder Biopharmaceuticals CEO discuss migraine treatment
 Alder Biopharmaceuticals' migraine treatment is one step closer to being FDA-approved after its latest trial, the drugmaker's co-founder and CEO Randall Shatzman told Cramer on Friday.
""What the trial showed was that when we administer Eptinezumab in these patients, as soon as day one, we can see a dramatic clinical benefit: 50 percent less migraines on day one,"" the CEO said. ""About 15 percent of the patients in the study had zero migraines for the 12-week duration of that study, and that's going from 16 migraines down to zero. And this is with a single dose of Eptinezumab that lasted the full three months of the study. So we think it's an opportunity … to really transform how migraine is treated today.""
Alder's intravenous treatment has faced competition from giants like Allergan, who have developed migraine treatments in pill form.
But Shatzman said that patients with severe migraines don't care how treatments are administered; they simply care whether or not they work.
""For them, whether it comes as a subcutaneous injection or whether it comes as an IV infusion that they take four times per year, that's very appealing for them,"" he told Cramer. ""The next steps for us are to get that filing for the FDA together and get it in and look forward to continuing our interactions with the FDA for an ultimate approval next year.""
 Faherty Brand CEO: Retail closures are opportunities
 Faherty Brand founder and CEO Alex Faherty said that the recent wave of store closings across the country only creates more bountiful opportunities for his budding clothing brand.
""Right now, with all the stores that are closing, it creates opportunity for new brands,"" he told Cramer at the ICR Conference in Orlando, Florida. ""Landlords are willing to do shorter-term deals where the brands can actually make money, and I think that now is going into our favor as far as being able to open up new retail stores.""
With a business that's 40 percent e-commerce, Faherty's high-quality clothing has become especially popular among 21-to-45-year-olds, the CEO said, adding that services like Shopify have changed the game entirely for retailers.
""Our technology can do whatever the largest of brands can do now. The barriers to entry have completely changed,"" Faherty said. ""Basically, what used to cost $10 million, to build a back-end of a website for a customer, I, for $1,000 a month can basically have the world's greatest mousetrap when it comes to creating a website.""
 Lightning Round: Don't waste your opportunity with WM
 In Cramer's lightning round, he zipped through his take on some callers' favorite stocks:
Waste Management: ""It is a super-de-duper buy. Did you see that buyback they just announced? I've been telling club members of ActionAlertsPlus.com the cash flow and the tax regime [are] both fabulous.""
Orbital ATK: ""That's kind of a done deal. I think it's time for Raytheon and then General Dynamics.""

Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook
 Walt Disney Co. said late Friday that Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey won't be re-nominated to its board, citing conflicts of interest as Facebook and Twitter push further into Disney's businesses.
 In its annual proxy filing, the media giant said it would propose a slate of 10 directors at its annual shareholder meeting, and neither Sandberg, the Facebook COO, nor Twitter CEO Dorsey were included on it.
In a statement, Disney made reference to moves by both social media companies to produce or license an increasing amount of media and entertainment content.
 ""Given our evolving business and the businesses Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey are in, it has become increasingly difficult for them to avoid conflicts relating to Board matters, and they are not standing for re-election,"" the statement said.

 Facebook's pivot away from news will pay off in the long run, according to Wall Street analysts.
 The company announced on Thursday a major change to its newsfeed. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the internet giant will start prioritizing ""meaningful social interactions"" versus ""relevant content,"" and that he expects the time people spend on the social network will go down as a result.
Facebook shares dropped 4.5 percent Friday following the news.
 But on Tuesday, they were up nearly 1 percent after Needham reaffirmed its buy rating for the social media giant, predicting strong financial results this year.
""We are positive about these changes because we believe they will be economically neutral and they lower the risk that FB gets regulated,"" analyst Laura Martin wrote in a note to clients. ""By pivoting away from publishers (ie, news), FB immediately lowers its perceived power to spread 'fake news,' which lowers the risk of government intervention. We expect FB's ad price to rise as time spent and/or ad units fall.""
Martin reiterated her $215 price target for Facebook shares, representing 20 percent upside to Friday's close.
The analyst downplayed Zuckerberg's warning that the changes may lead to less user time spent on the internet service. She said the company has made repeated warnings in the past 18 months over growth.
""Selling FB's shares on this worry proved to be a mistake in 2017,"" she wrote. ""What FB's financial performance has demonstrated so far is that as FB's ad inventory shrinks, its prices at auction become more robust, nearly frenetic.""
GBH Insights' Daniel Ives is also confident Facebook will be able to raise its pricing after the changes.
""We see minimal negative financial implications from this move for Zuckerberg & Co in 2018. … Limited ad inventory will ultimately help drive up pricing power and more than offset decreased ad load,"" he wrote in a note Monday. ""We continue to believe this was the right strategic move at the right time for Facebook.""
Ives reaffirmed his ""highly attractive"" rating and $225 price target for Facebook shares.

 David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital bought Twitter shares, according to an investor letter sent to clients on Tuesday. 
 ""We initiated a small position in Twitter at an average [price] of $21.59,"" the letter said. ""Despite a massive user base and broad reach, Twitter has an enterprise value of about 2% of Facebook, the largest social media platform.""
The investor also said the fund started long positions in Brighthouse Financial, Ensco and Time Warner. 
 Einhorn explained Time Warner will likely get acquired by AT&T, but the company's stock will do well even if the deal doesn't happen.

David Marcus, vice president of Messaging Products at Facebook, speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, April 18, 2017.
 The Facebook executive leading its messaging products said the company will streamline its Messenger app this year because its design has become ""too cluttered.""
 The number of Messenger video chats also doubled in 2017, Facebook vice president David Marcus said in a post.
The company added emoji characters and other elements in 2016 and 2017 to enhance the Messenger user experience but not all have worked out as planned, Marcus says.
 ""Over the last two years, we built a lot of capabilities to find the features that continue to set us apart. A lot of them have found their product market fit; some haven't. While we raced to build these new features, the app became too cluttered. Expect to see us invest in massively simplifying and streamlining Messenger this year,"" Marcus wrote in the post, titled ""Six Trends for 2018.""
At the same time, Marcus sees Messenger and the broader messaging market, which also includes Facebook-owned WhatsApp, becoming more visual. 
""I predict visual messaging will fully explode in 2018; people will expect a super fast and intuitive camera, video, images, GIFs, and stickers with almost every conversation. Even in the workplace where conversations can be more serious, we see people embracing emojis and video to help drive a point home,"" Marcus wrote.
""There were 17 billion video chats on Messenger for the year - two times as many as compared to 2016,"" he wrote.
Messenger currently has 1.3 billion monthly users. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also said last week that the company would be making a ""major change"" to users' news feeds to emphasize more ""relevant content,"" which could result in people spending less time on the platform.

 Social media giants battle extremist content   
 12:00  PM ET Wed, 17 Jan 2018 |  04:31 
 Facebook, Google and Twitter told Congress Wednesday that they've gone beyond screening and removing extremist content and are creating more anti-terror propaganda to pre-empt violent messages at the source.
 Representatives from the three companies told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that they are, among other things, targeting people likely to be swayed by extremist messages and pushing content aimed at countering that message. Several senators criticized their past efforts as not going far enough.
""We believe that a key part of combating extremism is preventing recruitment by disrupting the underlying ideologies that drive people to commit acts of violence. That's why we support a variety of counterspeech efforts,"" said Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management, according to an advance copy of her testimony obtained by CNBC.
 Bickert said that in addition to using image matching and language analysis to identify terror content before it's posted, the company is ramping up what it calls ""counterspeech.""
Facebook is also working with universities, nongovernmental organizations and community groups around the world ""to empower positive and moderate voices,"" Bickert said.
Google's YouTube, meanwhile, says it will continue to use what it calls the ""Redirect Method,"" developed by Google's Jigsaw research group, to send anti-terror messages to people likely to seek out extremist content through what is essentially targeted advertising. If YouTube determines that a person may be headed toward extremism based on their search history, it will serve them ads that subtly contradict the propaganda that they might see from ISIS or other such groups. Meanwhile, YouTube supports ""Creators for Change,"" a group of people who use their channels to counteract hate.
 ""We believe that a key part of combating extremism is preventing recruitment by disrupting the underlying ideologies that drive people to commit acts of violence.""
-Monika Bickert , Facebook's head of global policy management
 The video site is also adapting how it deals with videos that are offensive but don't technically violate its community guidelines, putting this so-called borderline content behind interstitials and removing comments, according to the testimony of Juniper Downs, YouTube's head of public policy.
Downs said that over the past year YouTube's algorithms, in concert with human reviewers, have been able to remove hateful content faster than before.
""Our advances in machine learning let us now take down nearly 70% of violent extremism content within 8 hours of upload and nearly half of it in 2 hours,"" Downs said.
Twitter's Carlos Monje Jr., director of public policy and philanthropy in the U.S. and Canada, said the company has participated in more than 100 trainings events since 2015 on countering extremist content.
Those training sessions included events in Beirut, Bosnia, Belfast and Brussels and summits at the White House, the United Nations and in London and Sydney, Monje said in his prepared testimony.
 Tech companies under fire from lawmakers
 The U.S.-based tech giants have come under fire in the U.S. and Europe for allowing their websites to be used by Islamic terrorists and other extremists for recruiting and propaganda.
The German government passed a law last year that fines internet companies for allowing hate speech to remain on a site for more than 24 hours. Leaders in France and the U.K., which have suffered a series of terrorist attacks, have threatened similar action.
Now the companies are feeling the heat in Washington after revelations that extremists are using their services to recruit and target Americans.
A November report from New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights estimated the Islamic terrorist group ISIS generated 200,000 social media messages every day.
An investigation by CNBC, meanwhile, found dozens of accounts on Facebook and Google Plus being used by terrorists to promote their message. Some of those accounts had been taken over by hackers first.
All three firms said last year they were adding more workers to screen content and boosting investment in software that uses artificial intelligence to find and remove violent posts and videos.
They also created an industry-wide group, the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, to share data on extremist groups. The forum said in December its database had 40,000 images and videos which it was using to screen content from their sites.
""Social media companies realize the damage of these bad actors far too late,"" says Clint Watts, the Robert A. Fox Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, who is also scheduled to testify at Wednesday's hearing.

Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 2016 CEO Summit in Lima, Peru.
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is asking his followers implore Congress to resolve DACA recipients' immigration status.
 DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, is a U.S. immigration policy that allowed people who entered the country before they were 16 prior to 2007 and stayed in the country illegally to get a work permit and two-year period where they would not be deported. The status does not allow for a path to citizenship. About 800,000 ""dreamers"" are in the program.
President Donald Trump ended DACA in September 2017, saying he wanted lawmakers to reform the process within 6 months. A U.S. district judge in San Francisco ruled DACA must stay in place while there are pending lawsuits regarding the end of the program, but the Trump administration will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. 
 Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page DACA recipients are in limbo while their legal status is being negotiated. Though he said he was ""optimistic"" there will be a resolution, he said there is a need fix it soon because people are ""living in fear with no ability to plan for the future."" 
""This is a basic question of whether our government works,"" he wrote. ""Can Congress come together and find a path forward, or will we default to forcing almost one million people out of their jobs and country?""
Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg also wrote about DACA on her Facebook page on Tuesday, saying immigrants helped create the United States and make it stronger. 
""The United States is not a cruel country,"" Sandberg wrote. ""But what we're considering doing to Dreamers is cruel. They deserve the chance to earn citizenship and legal protection to keep them safe and keep their families together. And they deserve it now.""
See Zuckerberg's full post below: 
 Every day that Congress doesn't act more DACA recipients are losing their status. Dreamers are members of our communities, and there are 800,000 living in fear with no ability to plan for the future. Teachers with DACA don't know if they'll be allowed to teach in a few months -- but somehow we expect them to take care of our children. First responders with DACA don't know if they'll get to stay here -- yet they worked around the clock to save lives after the hurricanes in Texas and Florida. This is a basic question of whether our government works. Can Congress come together and find a path forward, or will we default to forcing almost one million people out of their jobs and country? I'm optimistic this will get solved. There's been some good bipartisan momentum on legislation recently. From my conversations with leaders in Congress, I believe they want to fix this, but we need to keep the pressure on so they know we'll hold them accountable. I've been calling members of Congress and you can help by calling your Congressman or Congresswoman too right now. To learn more and get connected today, go to http://dreamers.fwd.us.

 The future of Rappler, a former media partner of Facebook, is in question after a local regulator revoked its operating license on Monday. 
 ""The shuttering of Rappler — an organization whose credibility was undermined as a result of fake news and trolling circulating on Facebook — is a tragic reminder to Facebook of the central role it plays in shaping political discourse,"" said Carly Nyst, a human rights lawyer and independent consultant to non-governmental organizations, think tanks, and the private sector.
""It is increasingly untenable for Facebook to deny its role in facilitating the Duterte regime's clampdown on critical voices,"" she added.

 In response to such complaints, Facebook told CNBC it has taken steps to ensure the network is a safe space for people to express themselves politically. Those include new tools and technologies to prevent fake accounts, false stories, clickbait, harassment and hate speech.
""We recognize that the same tools that give people more voice can sometimes be abused, by anyone, to spread hoaxes and misinformation,"" a company representative said. ""We prohibit people from setting up fake accounts and have developed improved automated systems — using machine learning and artificial intelligence — to better identify and remove them quickly.""
The Philippines boasts one of the world's most active social media populations and is a crucial market for Facebook, which has an office in Manila and recently partnered with Duterte's administration on a high-speed Internet infrastructure project.
""While Facebook has expressed interest to have partnerships with (academia) and the media to better maximize the platform, it has not lent its voice in denouncing various forms of media harassment and intimidation, or even the prevailing culture of impunity,"" said Danilo Arao, associate professor at the University of the Philippines.
Arao said the company, already under fire for its role in propagating inaccurate articles during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, should use its power and influence to take a stand. But he said he doubts that will happen: ""It is still a business, and it does not make good business sense to antagonize governments, no matter how repressive they may be, as in the case of the Philippines.""
Still, Nyst argued that the social media platform ""needs to wake up to the fact that it can no longer claim neutrality and immunity from responsibility, but rather needs to adhere to journalistic ethics befitting of the world's largest publisher.""
 The shutdown
 The Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission revoked the outlet's operating license on Monday. The regulator claimed the publication's acceptance of $1 million in funding from a U.S. fund broke a law that bans foreign ownership in media institutions. In response, Rappler has stated that it is owned by Filipinos, and noted that the very same regulator had accepted documentation of the investment in 2015.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte
 Rappler's criticism of the country's president is widely believed to have influenced the regulator's decision. The outlet reported that the government was paying for trolls and bots to spread propaganda — a story that was deemed ""fake"" by government-aligned accounts on social media.
Duterte this week denied any role in the incident but slammed Rappler content for being ""pregnant with falsity.""
Misinformation is a major political issue that has complicated public discourse around Manila's ongoing drug war.
In fact, many have deemed Monday's SEC decision as part of Manila's broader campaign to silence detractors. Phelim Kine, deputy director at Human Rights Watch's Asia division, called the move ""a sinister use of state regulatory processes to stifle critical media voices.""
Rappler was launched as a Facebook page in 2012 and enjoyed triple-digit growth in its formative years.
In 2015, the news outlet partnered with the social network on a project aimed at loading news articles faster on Facebook's mobile app but pulled out the following year amid concerns that the algorithm was spreading false information.
Rappler founder Maria Ressa has long urged CEO Mark Zuckerberg to crack down on the spread of intentionally inaccurate reports, which she has said is hurting democracy around the world.

At the time, Zuckerberg says he was simply solving a problem he saw around him.
 ""Yeah, well, I never started this to build a company,"" says Zuckerberg, speaking to Freakonomics Radio as part of its six-week series called ""The Secret Life of CEOs,"" which launched Thursday. 
""Ten years ago, you know, I was just trying to help connect people at colleges and a few schools.

 ""That was a basic need, where I looked around at the internet and there were services for a lot of things that you wanted,"" says Zuckerberg, according to a transcript.  ""You could find music; you could find news; you could find information, but you couldn't find and connect with the people that you cared about, which as people is actually the most important thing.
""So that seemed like a pretty big hole that needed to get filled.""

124,2018-01-19,Executive Behind Facebook’s China Charm Campaign Is Out  Facebook's News Feed will now have users decide 'high quality' news through surveys  Facebook to rank news based on sources' trustworthiness  ,"Getty Images
Mark Zuckerberg
 The executive in charge of Facebook’s efforts to court China has left the company, a fresh setback for the social network as it seeks to get its products into China’s huge internet market.
Wang-Li Moser, who as Facebook’s lead liaison with Beijing had become a symbol of its ambitions in the country, resigned in December, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Ms. Moser had been brought in from Intel to professionalize Facebook’s efforts to court China’s government. Her job was a tough one. She set up and presided over negotiations between China’s most powerful officials and a social network that many of them believed could be dangerously destabilizing.
 She also had to manage broader trade and security frictions between China and the United States. China blocks Facebook and most other major American internet companies, fearing the products could be used to undermine the government. Google, Twitter and Snapchat are all inaccessible within China. Apple and Amazon have been forced to use local partners to offer cloud services.
During her roughly three-year tenure, Ms. Moser worked behind the scenes as Facebook waged a charm campaign to get back into the country. As part of those efforts, Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, showed off his Mandarin, did a promotional jog through a polluted Tiananmen Square and dined with President Xi Jinping.
Ms. Moser’s departure, after she failed to achieve any major breakthrough in China, underscores the challenges, and setbacks, Facebook has faced as it seeks to gain entry to one of the world’s largest — and most closed off — internet markets.

Along with Mr. Zuckerberg’s high-profile appearances in China, Facebook has quietly tried numerous other strategies to gain access. The company worked internally on a tool that would allow targeted censorship, even as some employees quit over the project. The tool has thus far not been used.
Last year, Facebook took the novel approach of releasing an app in China without putting its name to the product. Called Colorful Balloons, the app is an almost exact copy of Facebook’s own photo-sharing app Moments. Considered a sort of trial balloon to better understand the market, the app was introduced anonymously by Facebook through a separate company. It appears to be no longer available in app stores in China.
Stepping into the role of government liaison will be William Shuai, a former government relations executive at the Chinese search engine Baidu and the American social network LinkedIn. Before holding those positions, Mr. Shuai was briefly a low-level official in the Chinese government.
For Facebook, which declined to comment on Ms. Moser’s departure, getting into China remains a major priority. China is Facebook’s largest market for ad spending in Asia, even though it is blocked in the country. Chinese companies, local governments and the state news media all use advertising on Facebook as a way to reach beyond Chinese borders.
As has generally been the case for Facebook, at the moment there are both signs of progress and problems for the company efforts to enter China.
Facebook has been quietly scouting Shanghai for an office and late last year Mr. Zuckerberg was among several executives who met President Xi shortly after China’s leaders held the 19th Communist Party Congress.
But in the lead-up to the party congress, Chinese censors blocked the company’s last major viable product in China, WhatsApp. The chat app remains mostly unusable in the country.

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
 To solve its ""fake news"" problem, Facebook is asking its users to complete surveys on what they determine is ""high quality"" news content. 
 CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a post on his Facebook page Friday that the company will ask users if they are familiar with a specific news source — and whether they trusted it — in order to help weed out less reliable sources. As a result of the changes, people can expect the level of news in the News Feed to drop from the current 5 percent to 4 percent, Zuckerberg said.
The move is another effort by the company to re-establish trust with the public, after much of that trust was eroded in wake of revelations about Russian interests using the platform to influence the 2016 U.S. election. (The company's image was further tarred by some former high-level employees criticizing the platform, including co-founder Sean Parker saying that the network was specifically built to exploit vulnerabilities in human psychology.)
 ""There's too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today,"" Zuckerberg wrote. ""Social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don't specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them,"" he wrote.
Facebook said earlier this month it would be shifting its News Feed algorithms to prioritize ""meaningful social interactions."" The News Feed is currently designed to prioritize relevant content from friends and family, but now will highlight content that people are likely to comment, view and share regardless if it comes from a peer or a company. 
The company added in a blog post it is highlighting content that is trustworthy, informative and relevant to local communities. The survey process will begin in the U.S. and expand globally.

Rupert Murdoch
 Rupert Murdoch said on Monday that Facebook and Google have made ""scurrilous"" news sources popular, and that the U.S. tech giants should pay publishers if they want ""trusted"" content.
 ""Facebook and Google have popularized scurrilous news sources through algorithms that are profitable for these platforms but inherently unreliable,"" the News Corp. chairman said in a statement.
""If Facebook wants to recognize 'trusted' publishers then it should pay those publishers a carriage fee similar to the model adopted by cable companies,"" Murdoch said.
 The statement comes after Facebook said Friday it would survey its users about what news sources they trust, and tweak its ranking software to help promote more the credible ones.
In his own Facebook post last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, ""I've asked our product teams to make sure we prioritize news that is trustworthy, informative, and local. And we're starting next week with trusted sources.""
Facebook and Google have been gobbling up an ever-larger chunk of the digital ad market. The two companies are expected to post combined sales of just over $185 billion in 2018, based on Wall Street estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters.
Murdoch says the two companies should pay to ensure their users get quality journalism.
""Recognition of a problem is one step on the pathway to cure, but the remedial measures that both companies have so far proposed are inadequate, commercially, socially and journalistically.
""There has been much discussion about subscription models but I have yet to see a proposal that truly recognizes the investment in and the social value of professional journalism. We will closely follow the latest shift in Facebook's strategy, and I have no doubt that Mark Zuckerberg is a sincere person, but there is still a serious lack of transparency that should concern publishers and those wary of political bias at these powerful platforms,"" Murdoch wrote.

(L-R) Amazon's chief Jeff Bezos, Larry Page of Alphabet, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and President-elect Donald Trump at Trump Tower December 14, 2016.
 Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google cumulatively racked up a roughly $50 million tab fighting off President Donald Trump and an onslaught of new federal regulations last year — a reflection that the tech industry is increasingly under political siege in the nation's capital.
Over the course of 2017, the biggest brands in tech warred with the White House over immigration, tried and failed to save net neutrality and weathered a congressional investigation into the ways in which Russian trolls spread propaganda on their sites during the last election.
The heightened scrutiny and withering criticism — targeting tech on everything from sex trafficking to fake news — prompted many companies to spend more money than ever to lobby the government, according to official ethics forms filed at midnight. And yet the industry's political activities in 2017 may only presage a tougher and costlier clash with Washington, D.C., in the year to come.
 Tech's most prolific political spender last year was Google, which dedicated more than $18 million to lobby the U.S. government. That's more than its tech peers, not to mention much of corporate America.
More from Recode:
 Here's why people on Twitter are seeing news alerts that they didn't ask for  Netflix now has nearly 118 million streaming subscribers globally  Bitcoin broker Coinbase booked $1 billion in revenue last year — so the company has told hovering VCs to back off 
Like other tech giants, Google sought to stave off new regulations targeting the content and ads that appeared on sites and services like search and YouTube. Meanwhile, the company pitched its own wares,  like self-driving cars, as lawmakers and other federal officials debated the new technology.
Amazon, meanwhile, spent more than $12.8 million in lobbying last year — nearly four times what it spent four years earlier — as it continued to advocate for friendlier federal rules around everything from online sales taxes and cloud computing to package-delivering drones. The company also had to contend in 2017 with fresh questions about the size of its corporate footprint, particularly after acquiring Whole Foods.
Facebook spent a record amount last year — roughly $11.5 million — as lawmakers railed on the social giant for the ""fake news"" and other content that appeared in users' feeds.
And Apple shelled out $7 million — again, more than ever — to lobby the U.S. government over the same period. The iPhone giant continued to press forward on issues like encryption and immigration. And the company — like the rest of the industry — advocated for the tax reform law recently signed by Trump.
Apple and Facebook declined to comment for this story; Amazon and Google did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
For much of tech, the industry's tough 2017 began as soon as Trump entered the White House and signed an executive order restricting immigrants and refugees from majority-Muslim countries. While federal courts later tossed that initial directive, Trump's early, aggressive stance on immigration only foreshadowed further restrictions, including those targeting  high-skilled foreign workers and their spouses.
More recently, tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft have tapped their vast lobbying armies to  revive a program known as DACA. Scrapped by Trump in 2017, it had protected young immigrants who had been brought illegally to the U.S. as children from being deported. The future of DACA fed a stalemate in Congress this January that briefly caused the U.S. government to shut down.
Web companies, meanwhile, faced unfamiliar calls for fresh regulation in the nation's capital last year. For Facebook, Google and Twitter, it primarily came in the form of an investigation that found that hundreds of millions of their U.S. users had  fallen victim to Russian disinformation during the 2016 election..
In response, some lawmakers sought new federal rules governing the way that tech companies display political ads. But Facebook, Google and Twitter each devoted their seemingly limitless  lobbying resources toward fighting the measure, called the Honest Ads Act, as their federal disclosures show.
So, too, did that trio fight a proposal to hold social-media companies, ad networks and others accountable for enabling — or even failing to spot —  sex trafficking on their platforms. And these and other tech players lobbied extensively last year to  save the U.S. government's net neutrality rules, which the Federal Communications Commission ultimately scrapped in December anyway.
Those three fights — political ads, sex trafficking and net neutrality — remain unresolved at the beginning of 2018. Meanwhile, lawmakers and federal regulators are beginning to question the social costs of the digital age. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, for one, has emerged as one of  the more vocal critics of the ""downsides"" of social media.
Of course, the tech industry didn't totally lose in Trump's Washington last year. A major tax reform bill signed into law seems guaranteed to lessen tech giants' annual bills to the feds. To that end, Apple — a longtime advocate for tax reform — announced this month that it would reinvest billions of dollars in the United States.
Meanwhile, Uber also spent slightly more to lobby lawmakers and federal regulators last year. The ride-hailing giant in 2017 had to contend with a major executive shakeup, a series of allegations about sexism, multiple investigations into its business practices and a  major data security breach that it initially withheld from federal investigators.
Less known, however, is that the company began to lobby in Washington, D.C. for the first time on issues related to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPPA. The 1996 law governs the privacy and security of medical information, and Uber declined to explain to Recode why it hired a lobbyist last year specifically to focus on the issue.
So too did Uber begin to share with federal regulators its ""advancements in vertical take-off and landing technology,"" or VTOL. Remember,  Uber has been exploring for years whether it's possible to fly its users around cities.

 President Donald Trump has shown some reluctance to recognize the intelligence agencies' conclusions. In November, Trump said he believes the findings of the agencies ""as currently led"" by his appointees.

One of the creators of Flicks is Christopher Horvath, a former architect with Facebook's Story Studio. Horvath left that team in May and began later that month at Facebook's social virtual reality unit, according to a representative from Oculus.
 He noted in a Facebook post that his invention had made it into the real world:
 Story Studio, which Facebook closed last year, was nominated for an Emmy for the VR film ""Dear Angelica."" Horvath won an Emmy for an earlier Oculus film called ""Henry.""
Facebook shuttered the unit after deciding it didn't want a stand-alone studio.. 
According to Facebook, Flick ""is the smallest time unit which is LARGER than a nanosecond.""
 Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that Christopher Horvath began working with Facebook's social virtual reality unit in May, according to a representative from Oculus.

 With stocks like FB or P&G, check your bias at the door   
 6:52  PM ET Tue, 23 Jan 2018 |  01:00 
 It used to be an unspoken rule for investors to sell stocks at the first sign of negative news, but sometimes, the rules have to change, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday.
 ""This time is indeed different, which means you can't take your cue from the playbook that worked in more troubled times,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""We've developed a vicious tendency to want to give up on stocks of companies that slip up, especially after big moves ... but you know what? These days, that tendency will lead you astray.""
In a market that brushes off weak earnings reports and formerly market-rattling events, Cramer said that having long-standing biases about certain companies and stocks can hurt investors.
 One example of this was the recent action in Facebook's stock after the company's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced sweeping changes to the social media website's News Feed.
Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post that the move was meant to curb ""sensationalism, misinformation and polarization"" on the platform and promote ""meaningful"" user interactions.
Shares of Facebook instantly fell on the news, sliding from $187 a share to $177 in the days following the announcement.
But Cramer argued that Zuckerberg was making a smart move reacting to public opinion, much of which has soured on Facebook in favor of its more youthful platform, Instagram.
""Zuckerberg was responding to Facebook's need to restore its reputation in order to stay off a potential deceleration in the business. This move he announced is a good thing and will most likely lead to higher ad rates as advertisers push for a better user experience and, therefore, exposure to the company's precious worldwide audience,"" Cramer said.
""Of course the stock has come back with a vengeance,"" he contineud. ""It's up more than $1 from where it was when Zuckerberg made the pronunciation of death.""
Big tech companies aren't the only ones falling victim to bias. Cramer pointed to two consumer goods companies also under undue pressure: Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson.
With activist Nelson Peltz joining Procter & Gamble's board and CEO David Taylor steadying the ship, the company's weak quarter simply means the recovery is still ahead, Cramer argued, adding that investors are getting a good buying opportunity.
Johnson & Johnson's post-earnings weakness was caused in part by a patent conflict over one of its key drugs, Remicade. But Cramer also attributed that decline to weak-handed sellers.
""This is precisely when you want to buy a stock like Johnson & Johnson,"" Cramer said. ""Sure, I know there will be some doofus that will cut numbers tomorrow and tell you to get out of the stock because of the loss of exclusivity. That's what Wall Street does. ... But this stock rarely ever comes down, and what is this management going to do other than find more ways to make you money?""
The ""Mad Money"" host acknowledged how shocking it can be to see these stocks fall, especially for people who remember a time when investors were more inclined to sell on a whim.
""This bull market is like nothing we've seen since the great rallies of the '80s and '90s,"" Cramer said. ""If you take your cue from the last decade, you're going to miss out on some incredible opportunities. You'll be blind to them. We're now in a world where bad news is good news, because bad news is the only thing that gives you enough of a meaningful pullback that you can pull the trigger.""

 Big issue is whether Facebook can regulate itself: Inside.com's Jason Calacanis   
 12:30  PM ET Wed, 24 Jan 2018 |  02:05 
 Facebook has hired a former White House official as its first head of cybersecurity policy. 
 The social media giant confirmed Nathaniel Gleicher has joined the company. He joined Facebook this month, according to his LinkedIn profile, from cybersecurity firm Illumio.
The hire was first noted by cybersecurity website Cyberscoop. 
 Gleicher's hire comes as Facebook struggles to keep a small number of users from posting hate speech and spreading fake news on the site. This week the company bought a start-up called Confirm that authenticates user identities. Last week Facebook said it was overhauling its News Feed in an effort to promote ""trusted"" news sources.
Facebook has also come under fire for alleged failures to curtail Russian meddling during the 2016 presidential election. The company said in November it would expand its cybersecurity efforts. 
Gleicher previously served as the director for cybersecurity policy at the National Security Council and as senior counsel to the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section at the Department of Justice.
Correction: Nathaniel Gleicher joined Facebook this month and it's unclear which team he will be working with. That fact was misstated in an earlier version.

 Soros: Trump has US 'set on a course towards nuclear war'   
 11:22  AM ET Fri, 26 Jan 2018 |  00:49 
 Billionaire investor George Soros bashed Facebook and Google in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, saying that it's ""only a matter of time before the global dominance of the US IT monopolies is broken,"" according to a transcript obtained by CNBC.
 Soros said the tech companies were a ""menace"" and ""ever more powerful monopolies,"" that would be tempted to ""compromise themselves"" to enter the Chinese market, where they have long been banned. 
""[A]s Facebook and Google have grown into ever more powerful monopolies, they have become obstacles to innovation, and they have caused a variety of problems of which we are only now beginning to become aware,"" he said, according to the transcript.
 ""They claim they are merely distributing information. But the fact that they are near-monopoly distributors makes them public utilities and should subject them to more stringent regulations, aimed at preserving competition, innovation, and fair and open universal access,"" he said.
Buzzfeed first reported the news.
The temptation to among these companies to cooperate with authoritarian regimes like China in order to get access to those markets ""may well result in a web of totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined."" 
""Davos is a good place to announce that their days are numbered,"" he said.
Facebook in particular has come under fire from both big names and former employees as it has struggled to dampen hate speech and foreign influence on its platform.
Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also criticized Facebook at the annual meeting of global elites, where he called for Facebook to be regulated like tobacco companies. 
Soros separately at Davos had strong words for President Donald Trump, saying he has set the U.S. ""on a course towards nuclear war.""

Colin Stretch, general counsel for Facebook arrives to testify before Senate Judiciary Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee hearing on on ""ways to combat and reduce the amount of Russian propaganda and extremist content online,"" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 31, 2017.
 Facebook admitted this month that it recommended content produced by Russian operatives to some users, the latest acknowledgment that it underestimated how extensively foreign actors manipulated its platform around the time of the 2016 presidential election.
 ""This happened in some cases,"" Facebook told the Senate Intelligence Committee, in a written follow-up to a November hearing about election interference through social media. ""Because we were not aware that these Pages were not legitimate, they were sometimes recommended when people followed similar Pages, for example.""
The answer was in response to a question from Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who asked if Facebook's recommendation engine suggested ""to any Facebook user that they view, follow, or join any of the Russian-linked pages."" The letter, dated Jan. 8, was made public on Thursday. 
 Facebook has been under fire for its failure to initially recognize or acknowledge how much Russians were using its service to push propaganda to potential voters. CEO Mark Zuckerberg originally called that a ""crazy"" idea, before apologizing last year. Facebook then said that 10 million people saw Russian-bought political ads, but later said that 126 million Americans may have seen such content.
Facebook also told the Senate in the response that it has found ""insignificant overlap"" between Russian-produced pages and ads and those created by the election campaign of President Donald Trump.

 In answering Collins' question about whether there was evidence of potential collusion between Trump and Russian group on social media, Facebook said it ""does not believe it is in a position to substantiate or disprove"" such allegations.
Facebook was also asked if it made money from content produced by the Internet Research Agency, or IRA, a Russian propaganda farm.
""Ads generally did not run on IRA Pages, and we expect that any revenue from such ads would be immaterial,"" the company said.
Facebook said that Russian groups also used the platform to promote real-world events. There were a total of 129 events created on 13 IRA pages that were viewed by around 338,300 accounts. About 62,500 accounts said they intended to go to an event. 
The company plans to ""significantly expand"" the number of people working on election integrity before the November midterm elections and said it will be hiring ""people who investigate this specific kind of abuse by foreign actors.""

 The FANG stocks' earnings season started off strong as Netflix crushed subscriber expectations Monday. One analyst is optimistic the other internet giants in the famed technology basket will also report strong earnings results next week. Netflix shares surged 15 percent in the two days following the stunning results.
 ""We expect its FANG brethren to continue the 'beat and raise' party next week by delivering stronger than expected earnings/2018 guidance,"" Daniel Ives, GBH Insights' head of technology research, wrote in a note to clients Thursday. ""Overall, we continue to be very bullish on secular tech themes for 2018 around streaming/content, e-commerce growth, online ad growth, and the transformational cloud shift among enterprises.""
FANG stocks are a basket of high-growth technology stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google).
 Ives reaffirmed his ""highly attractive"" ratings for Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook.
1) Amazon (AMZN)
The analyst raised his price target for Amazon shares to $1,500 from $1,375, representing 10.5 percent upside to Wednesday's close.
 ""We expect strength from Amazon across the board this quarter as our analysis indicates a better than performance on the North America retail channel as well on the AWS front … Amazon has a unique window of opportunity to double down on its consumer and enterprise initiatives for 2018 and drive significant growth/cash flow for the coming years as Bezos & Co. further diversifies the Amazon franchise globally."" 
Amazon will report its fourth-quarter earnings results on Feb. 1.
2) Alphabet (GOOGL)
Ives increased his forecast for Alphabet shares to $1,280 from $1,190, representing 9 percent upside to Wednesday's close.
 ""Our mobile search analysis/tracker this quarter continue to show strength from Google around its bread and butter search business, which should be a catalyst for modestly better than expected top and bottom-line results in 4Q as ad growth was the 'star of the show' this quarter. We are also seeing accelerating ad momentum from search and YouTube yet again this quarter and heading into 2018 despite noise in the market."" 
Alphabet will report its fourth-quarter earnings results on Feb. 1.
3) Facebook (FB)
The analyst reiterated his $225 price target for Facebook shares, representing 21 percent upside to Wednesday's close.
 ""Facebook is on a trajectory to have another solid quarter in 4Q on the MAU front and has strong momentum heading into 2018 on this all-important growth driver for the business, despite lingering clouds from the recent News Feed overhaul."" 
Facebook will report fourth-quarter earnings results on Jan. 31.

Robert Mueller
 Special counsel Robert Mueller's staff has interviewed at least one member of a Facebook team associated with President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, according to a new report in Wired, which cited a person familiar with the matter.
 The interview was part of Mueller's Department of Justice probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and what role, if any, the Trump campaign played in it, the report said.
The report comes a day after Facebook said, in written replies provided to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, that it found ""insignificant overlap"" between the targeting efforts of Trump's campaign and that of a Russian propaganda unit called the Internet Research Agency.
 Facebook also said in those replies, prompted by questions during a November 1 hearing on the matter, that it has been providing investigators, including those in Congress, with information it has regarding the scope and nature of Russian information operations.
That echoed a September post from CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said the company had shared what it had found with Meuller's probe.
""We are actively working with the U.S. government on its ongoing investigations into Russian interference...When we recently uncovered this activity, we provided that information to the special counsel,"" Zuckerberg wrote then.
Facebook has said previously that it offered help to both the Trump campaign and that of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, in using the company's platform for political advertising, but that it did not assign workers full time to either campaign. 
Facebook declined to comment. Read the full report in Wired here.

 Cramer breaks down the Super Bowl of earnings   
 6:26  PM ET Fri, 26 Jan 2018 |  00:51 
 This year, the week of the Super Bowl coincides with the week of the Super Earnings Bowl for CNBC's Jim Cramer.
 ""Even as President Trump made the pitch for doing business in America at Davos, it's the earnings that are front and center,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Without further ado, Cramer turned to the stocks and events he'll watch in one of the most eventful weeks of earnings season:
 Monday: Lockheed Martin
 ""Lockheed Martin kicks things off on Monday and all I can say is you want this company to give you some reason, any reason, to get into what's become the hottest group in the market, and that's the defense sector,"" Cramer said.
Trump's U.S.-centric sales pitch at Davos and Republicans' efforts to boost defense spending are powerful drivers for military hardware makers like Lockheed, the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""Unfortunately, you haven't gotten many opportunities to buy the defense stocks into weakness. Hopefully Lockheed will say something [in its earnings report] that causes a quick dip,"" he said.
 Tuesday: Pfizer, McDonald's, Advanced Micro Devices
 Pfizer: Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer will report earnings on Tuesday, but Cramer warned that investors shouldn't expect it to wow investors like AbbVie's quarter did.
""[AbbVie] is up $15 today thanks to, get this, earnings growth. Not buybacks, actual growth,"" Cramer said. ""I wouldn't hold your breath if you're waiting for that kind of thing from Pfizer.""
McDonald's: Cramer praised the fast-food chain's turnaround under CEO Steve Easterbrook ahead of its Tuesday earnings report.
""Easterbrook has turned this aging hulk around to the point where it's now doing three times the same-store sales of Starbucks in the U.S., and while I don't have a man-crush on him, I'm certainly blown away by how he keeps delivering,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
AMD: Encouraged by Intel's successful quarter, Cramer expected good earnings results from AMD and hoped CEO Lisa Su would tell an optimistic story.
 Wednesday: Boeing, Microsoft, Facebook
 Boeing: The Dow's top dog reports earnings on Wednesday. Despite Cramer's bullish long-term outlook for the company, he hoped this quarter would bring out sellers so that investors could get an opportunity to buy the roaring stock.
Microsoft: Cramer's outlook on Microsoft improved after Intel reported that the rate of decline in personal computer sales was slowing, even as sales were still down 2 percent.
""This relative improvement, along with the strength in the data center business, allowed Intel to thrive,"" he said. ""Microsoft wins with both the P.C. and the data center, with the latter fitting into the company's booming Azure cloud business.""
Facebook: Even though Cramer predicted Facebook would blow away the earnings estimates with its report, he expected management to talk down revenues and talk up expenses on the conference call.
""That will spook people,"" he warned. ""To make matters worse, Facebook will open the selling window for their shareholders who work at the company and we will see some first-class stock dumping from their top executives. So even if the numbers are as fabulous as I'm anticipating, the action's just going to be nightmarish.""
 Thursday: Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple
 Alibaba: The Chinese e-commerce giant will deliver its earnings report on Thursday, and Cramer expects a ""total blowout, because they're the masters of under-promise and over-deliver.""
The ""Mad Money"" host recommended that investors either buy the stock before the quarter drops, or wait for the typical ""down leg"" in the stock post-earnings.
Alphabet: Cramer hoped for news of repatriation or a share buyback program from the massive Google parent, but had otherwise dim expectations for its earnings report.
""I think Alphabet disappoints and then spends the rest of the quarter trading up as people realize [that] maybe that quarter wasn't so bad,"" he said. ""Be careful.""
Amazon: ""I see Amazon saying that it's going to spend a fortune building a new headquarters and that hurts the stock even after a fabulous quarter, giving you still one more chance to buy,"" Cramer said in anticipation of Amazon's Thursday earnings report.
Apple: Cramer wanted to prepare investors for the inevitable analyst-led shakedown of consumer products giant Apple after it reports earnings on Thursday.
""They'll seize on weakening sales of the new iPhone X, so I've just got to get you ready. I'm not so glib as to say that there won't be anything wrong with the quarter. There will be. There may be plenty of things wrong. But even if it's perfect, the analysts will find some way to make Apple look bad. It's what they do,"" he said.
Even so, Cramer said the potential for Apple to start a share buyback program or boost its dividend was real, giving shareholders a potential catalyst for another rally.
 Friday: Exxon Mobil, Chevron
 Cramer expected the usual pattern to occur for multinational oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron when they report their quarterly results on Friday.
""The first will likely be lackluster and the second will be unabashedly positive,"" he said. ""That's been the pattern for a year now. I bet this time will be no different.""
 Final thoughts
 ""Here's the bottom line: the Super Bowl of earnings, unlike the actual Super Bowl, never lets you down in terms of sheer excitement,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""I can't wait for the week to begin. Oh, yes, there's also the game: E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!""

If Facebook fully integrates Confirm.io's ""biometric identity authentication"" APIs into its own platform, it may become easier for users to regain access to their accounts in extenuating circumstances by scanning in a drivers license. Today, Facebook's billions of users can send the company a copy of their photo ID by snail mail to regain access. The tech could also help Facebook create a digital passport.

A woman waits for an elevator in front of a logo at Facebook's headquarters in London.
 Facebook is overseeing a transparency drive ahead of the introduction of stringent data protection rules in the European Union (EU).As global tech behemoths scramble to prepare for the impact of looming EU data privacy regulations, Facebook announced Sunday that it had published its so-called privacy principles for the first time. The privacy controls detail how the company handles users' information.
 ""We recognize that people use Facebook to connect, but not everyone wants to share everything with everyone — including with us,"" Erin Egan, chief privacy officer at Facebook, wrote in a blog post.
 Getting ready for GDPR
 The announcement from the world's largest social network is widely seen as an attempt to get ready for the introduction of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on May 25. The pending data protection shake-up marks the biggest overhaul of personal data privacy rules since the birth of the internet.
 Among other things, GDPR aims to boost a person's right to be forgotten as well as guaranteeing them free and easy access to their own personal data.Facebook's privacy principles — which are separate from the terms and conditions agreed to when someone opens an account — advise users on a range of issues, including how to manage the data the website uses to show them adverts, how to delete old posts and what happens when they delete their account.

 Facebook, which has more than 2 billion users, said it would soon roll out educational videos in order to help users control who is able to access their information. And instead of dispersing privacy information across the social network, it has moved all of its security settings onto one page.
""We put products through rigorous data security testing. We also meet with regulators, legislators and privacy experts around the world to get input on our data practices and policies,"" the blog post said.
 Transatlantic consequences
 The level of fines for companies found to be in breach of data protection laws is set to increase significantly under GDPR. Business could be fined as much as 4 percent of global turnover or 20 million euros, whichever figure is greater.
Speaking in Brussels, Belgium, last week, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer at Facebook, said the company's upcoming changes would give it ""a very good foundation to meet all the requirements of GDPR and to spur us on to continue investing in products and in educational tools to protect privacy.""
In recent years, Facebook has faced probes from EU regulators over its use of data and tracking of online activities.
While strict new regulations are poised to come into force in the EU in May, the changes are also rippling out worldwide with Google and Amazon both amending their respective privacy processes in recent weeks.

Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer and founder of Facebook Inc., speaks during the F8 Developers Conference in San Jose, California, U.S., on Tuesday, April 18, 2017.
 Facebook said Monday that changes it's making to its content-recommendation software will put more local news into users' feeds.
 ""Today, we're updating News Feed to also prioritize local news so that you can see topics that have a direct impact on you and your community and discover what's happening in your local area,"" the company wrote in a post.
""This change is taking effect in the U.S., and we plan to expand to more countries this year,"" said the post, which was written by Alex Hardiman, head of news product at the company, and Campbell Brown, head of news partnerships.
 Facebook said it is also ""testing a dedicated section on Facebook that connects people to news and information in their community, called Today In. We are testing this in six US cities and plan to expand in the coming months.""
The company said earlier this month it would begin to prioritize posts from friends and what Facebook calls ""high-quality news sources.""
Taken together, the changes will mean users will see less news overall in their feeds.
Facebook shares fell 4 percent on January 12, after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would make changes to promote more ""meaningful social interactions,"" though the stock has recovered since then.
The changes have come after members of Congress and other critics have faulted Facebook for allowing the spread of fake news, hate speech and other unwanted content on the site.
The company will report fourth-quarter and year-end results after the close of markets on Wednesday.

 Facebook is banning all ads that promote cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, in an effort to prevent people from advertising what the company is calling ""financial products and services frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices.""
That means no advertiser — even those that operate legal, legitimate businesses — will be able to promote things like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, initial coin offerings —  ICOs for short — or binary options, according to a Facebook  blog post.
That also means that  ""crypto-genius"" James Altucher, whose ads have appeared all over the internet and have become a meme of sorts for the entire crypto industry, won't be able to advertise on Facebook.
 Ads that violate the company's new policy will be banned on Facebook's core app, but also in other places where Facebook sells ads, including Instagram and its ad network, Audience Network, which places ads on third-party apps.

 10:43  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  00:50 
 A slew of negative reports hit the cryptocurrency world Tuesday.
 Facebook announced a ban on advertisements for ""binary options, initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency."" The blanket decision is part of the social media giant's efforts to prohibit ads for financial products and services ""that are frequently associated with misleading or deceptive promotional practices."" 
The news followed a Bloomberg report, citing a source, that on Dec. 6 the U.S. Commodity Futures and Trading Commission subpoenaed Bitfinex, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, and a digital coin company called Tether that is run by many of the same people as the exchange. The CFTC and a representative for the companies did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.
 Also on Tuesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that a court approved an emergency asset freeze for AriseBank, which claimed it raised $600 million in sales of new digital coins. Two websites for the Dallas-based firm were unavailable Tuesday morning, and its lawyers couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
Bitcoin tumbled 12 percent to a low near $9,810 on CoinDesk before recovering slightly, and all major cryptocurrencies sold off. 
The headlines hit as U.S. stocks tumbled for a second straight day amid a jump in Treasury yields. Some market analysts have attributed the cryptocurrency mania to the generally positive sentiment generated by stock market gains — the S&P 500 is in its second-longest bull market ever, a period without a drop of more than 20 percent from a recent high. 
Worries about regulation persist in east Asia, a major market for cryptocurrencies. South Korea's Financial Service Commission is trying to limit speculation. It confirmed Tuesday, South Korean time, to CNBC that new measures, such as bans on anonymous trading accounts, had been implemented.
In Japan, regulators are still trying to handle the fallout from a Friday hack on a major local exchange called Coincheck, which lost the equivalent of more than $500 million. Coincheck said the stolen NEM coins were held in storage linked to the internet, making it easier for hackers to steal the cryptocurrency. 
Alex Sunnarborg, founding partner of Tetras Capital, noted the hack likely ""spooked the market a bit, and especially among those with balances on exchanges, leading to the recent selling and drop in prices across crypto assets."" 
Despite Tuesday's slew of worrying headlines, bitcoin has survived worse over the years. It recovered from a more than $2,000 drop in September following China's cryptocurrency crackdown and has bounced back from several other plunges of more than 20 percent.  
""Because of the growth of the industry last year, there are some cracks in the industry as well that are being quickly ironed out,"" said Joe DiPasquale, founder and CEO of BitBull Capital, a cryptofund that invests in other cryptofunds. 
He said hedge-fund managers he spoke with ""are pretty encouraged now for the defining of a new bottom for bitcoin around $10,000. It's a support level that can be moved up from. The other things are growing pains for the industry.""

Former US Vice President Al Gore arrives at Trump Tower in New York on December 5, 2016.
 Former Vice President Al Gore's investment firm is making a big bet on one of the creators of Facebook.
 Asana, a software company headed by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, said on Tuesday that it raised $75 million in a financing round led by Generation Investment Management.
Generation, which Gore co-founded in 2004, invests globally and focuses on what it calls ""sustainable business practices."" Asana develops cloud-based project management software used by teams.
 ""Asana offers its customers a strong value proposition for work management, rooted in transparency and productivity, while fundamentally reducing resource inefficiencies and busy work,"" said Colin le Duc, one of Generation's founders, in a statement. 
Moskovitz, who was one of Zuckerberg's roommates at Harvard, left Facebook in 2008 to start Asana. The company is also backed by Y Combinator and Founders Fund, the venture firm led by early Facebook backer Peter Thiel. 
While Gore doesn't focus specifically on tech, he's had plenty of exposure to Silicon Valley. He's a board member at Apple and has long had ties to venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which still lists him as a senior partner.
Moskovitz and fellow Asana co-founder Justin Rosenstein said in Tuesday's statement that, ""we have both greatly admired Al Gore and the Generation team for their sustainability leadership in the business and financial community.""

 5:30  PM ET Wed, 31 Jan 2018 |  03:17 
 All that scrolling really ads up when it comes to Facebook's bottom line. 
 The company reported Q4 earnings on Wednesday, where it showed ""average revenue per user""— commonly shortened to ARPU on Wall Street — hit $6.18, up from just over $5 over the summer.
That's double the company's ARPU at the end of 2014, when it was $2.81.
 But most of Facebook's money still comes from users in the U.S. and Canada, where that number is even higher: $26.76 per user.
Facebook makes money by showing users advertisements — think of those sponsored videos from brands, or the little ad boxes on the bottom right-hand side of the screen. Other companies pay for that space on your Facebook feed, and to filter who sees each ad based on each viewer's interests or ""likes.""

 The number of people using Facebook daily in North America dropped for the first time   
 11:19  AM ET Thu,  1 Feb 2018 |  00:48 
 The number of people in the U.S. and Canada who check Facebook every day dropped between the third and fourth quarter of 2017, the first such quarterly drop in company history.
 Facebook usage in North America has been largely flat for the last several years, leaving international growth to pick up the slack. But the drop suggests that Facebook usage has reached a saturation point in its first and most lucrative market, and could foretell similar usage drops around the world.
The drop could also be a result of a steady drumbeat of negative press about Facebook, including concern over foreign governments using Facebook posts to divide the U.S. electorate during the 2016 election season, and growing concern over violent and other inappropriate content on the site.
 If usage flattens, Facebook will have to pack more ads into the News Feed, charge advertisers more per impression, or figure out new and similarly profitable business areas to maintain long-term growth.
Facebook claimed 184 million daily average users (DAUs) in the U.S. and Canada in Q4 2017, down from 185 million in Q3. Those users accounted for $6.39 billion of Facebook's revenue in the fourth quarter, up from $5.03 billion in Q3. That revenue increase despite the usage drop is probably thanks to seasonal changes related to the ad market, which is typically strongest in the holiday quarter.
On the company's earnings call, CFO David Wehner said that usage in this region would ""fluctuate"" based on m arket penetration.
Here's the usage chart from Facebook's earnings deck:

 Biggest names in tech to report earnings. But are any of the stocks worth a buy?   
 4:25  PM ET Tue, 30 Jan 2018 |  03:11 
 Brace yourself for a tech earnings wave over the next two days as some of the biggest names on Wall Street open their books to scrutiny.
 Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet all report this week. The five companies make up more than 40 percent of the Nasdaq 100.
Piper Jaffray's Craig Johnson has sifted through the bunch and picked one he thinks has the best potential: Apple.
 ""Clearly it's a great company,"" Johnson told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday. ""It hasn't gotten as extended as what we've seen with other companies in the tech landscape.""
Apple has endured a sharp pullback this year, siloed off from a broader market rally that lifted the S&P 500 to new records this year. Its shares slumped 4 percent last week, its worst performance since September, after several reports of weaker iPhone demand in recent months. Apple's signature smartphone is the largest contributor to sales.
Its recent decline has pulled its price-to-earnings ratio back below 15 to trade at 14.2 times forward earnings this week, its lowest level since October. By comparison, the Technology Select Sector ETF trades at 18.9 times forward earnings and the S&P 500 18.6 times forward earnings.
Compare Apple to some of the darlings of the tech space. The FANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet — trade at a far higher premium relative to earnings. Amazon holds the highest P/E at an eye-popping 168 times forward earnings and Alphabet the lowest at 28 times.
""They've all gotten fairly extended, a lot of the charts are starting to look a bit parabolic, almost going straight up,"" Johnson said of the general tech rally.
Tech gains carried the market in 2017. Facebook ended the year with its second-best annual performance since going public in 2013; earnings beats and a surprise purchase of Whole Foods fueled Amazon's 56 percent; steady subscriber growth helped Netflix add 55 percent; and Google rose 33 percent in its third straight year of gains. The XLK Tech ETF rallied 32 percent in 2017, exceeding the S&P 500's 19 percent gain.
For Michael Bapis, managing director at HighTower Advisors' Bapis Group, any gains for the rest of the tech sector will stem from product innovation in the last quarter and beyond.
""Reinventing yourself in today's technology world is one of the crucial components to earnings releases,"" he said on ""Trading Nation."" ""What's the next product they're developing? I think at the beginning of the year coming out, they should be focused on certain technologies that maybe no one is.""
For example, Bapis is keeping an eye on Microsoft for any announcements tied to new gaming or blockchain technology. Microsoft is scheduled to report earnings after the closing bell Wednesday, as do eBay, Microsoft, PayPal, Qualcomm and Symantec.
Thursday's session is just as busy: Alibaba is before the opening bell, and Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and GoPro report after the closing.
Correction: An earlier version misstated when Alibaba reports earnings. It is before the opening bell on Thursday.

James Altucher
 James Altucher has made himself the face of bitcoin.
Now  Facebook has banned him, and everyone else who wants to advertise anything to do with bitcoin and and other cryptocurrencies.
Good idea, Altucher says.
 ""I think this is a very good move for Facebook,"" Altucher says via email, in response to questions from Recode. ""There are many scams and illegitimate services out there.""
That's the same sentiment Facebook expressed yesterday, when it announced its ban on all crypto ads. And Facebook reps made it clear that the ad ban included the ones Altucher had paid for, on Facebook and throughout the web, with come-ons like ""crypto-genius reveals the next bitcoin.""
More from Recode: 
 Tech is now a weapon for propaganda and the problem is way bigger than Russia  It's not just bitcoin: Look at all the stuff Facebook won't let you advertise.  Trump didn't say much about tech in his first-ever State of the Union address 
 Altucher is a one-man self-help industry, who says he grossed $11 million in 2016, before the most recent crypto boom. He distributes free content on Facebook, podcasts and other outlets, and charges for subscriptions to services that offer stock picks and other financial advice.
Altucher is currently selling a ""Crypto Trader"" package that includes a ""six-video crypto masterclass"" and other services for $2,000.
I asked Altucher how much he spent marketing his crypto services, and what percent of his marketing spend went to Facebook, and what his plans are now. He didn't answer those questions, but did praise Facebook for ""trying to clean up all of the garbage out there.""
Here's the text of two emails Altucher sent in response to my queries:
 I think this is a very good move for Facebook. There are many scams and illegitimate services out there. About a year ago I had an opportunity to do a $100mm+ hedge fund in the crypto space. I turned it down in order to create a solid research service in the cryptocurrency space. I hired people, wrote a book, created a class, and send out reports every week to subscribers. In addition to my normal newsletter which is on entrepreneurship, health / well-being, and there are some articles each month or week on stocks. I wanted an opportunity to help many people instead of just a few (I've been there, done that in the hedge fund space). So I welcome any opportunity to help legitimate and sincere voices rise to the top, as they always do. My hope is that a lot more focus in the cypto space will be on education services. Something like 70% of Bitcoins are owned by men under 35. It's about time that ads and services start being focused on the enormous number of people that simply need to learn what a Bitcoin IS. And again, kudos to Facebook for trying to clean up all of the garbage out there. This is an enormous opportunity but, like any new financial opportunity, the schemers and crooked charlatans are having a field day. I've worked with Rob Leathern (the product manager at Facebook who wrote the press release) before (I was on the board of directors of his last company, Optimal, which sold to Brand Networks for $35 million) before. He's a genius level guy in this space and knows what he is doing. Overall, this is a positive move for the cryptocurrency space.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, left, and Google CEO Larry Page
 To make any real progress in advancing data privacy this year, we have to start doing something about Google and Facebook. Not doing so would be like trying to lose weight without changing your diet. Simply ineffective.
 The impact these two companies have on our privacy cannot be understated. You may know that hidden trackers lurk on most websites you visit, soaking up your personal information.
What you may not realize, though, is 76 percent of websites now contain hidden Google trackers, and 24 percent have hidden Facebook trackers, according to the Princeton Web Transparency & Accountability Project. The next highest is Twitter with 12 percent. It is likely that Google or Facebook are watching you on many sites you visit, in addition to tracking you when using their products.
 As a result, these two companies have amassed huge data profiles on each person, which can include your interests, purchases, search, browsing and location history, and much more. They then make your sensitive data profile available for invasive targeted advertising that can follow you around the Internet.
This advertising system is designed to enable hyper-targeting, which has many unintended consequences, such as the ability for bad actors to use the system to influence the most susceptible or to exclude groups in a way that facilitates discrimination.
 ""These two companies have amassed huge data profiles on each person, which can include your interests, purchases, search, browsing and location history, and much more.""
 Because of their entrenched positions in a wide array of Internet services, each collecting personal information that together combine into these massive digital profiles, Google and Facebook can offer hyper-targeting much better than the competition.
As a result, they now  make up 63 percent of all digital advertising, and accounted for 74 percent of this market's growth in 2017, according to eMarketer. Together they form a tight digital advertising duopoly, showing no signs of abating.
Google and Facebook also use your data as input for increasingly sophisticated AI algorithms that put you in a filter bubble — an alternate digital universe that controls what you see in their products, based on what their algorithms think you are most likely to click on.
These echo chambers distort people's reality, creating a myriad of unintended consequences such as increasing societal polarization. On their unending march to profit from more and more personal information, Google and Facebook have shown little regard for all the negative consequences of their runaway algorithms.
So how do we move forward from here?
Don't be fooled by claims of self-regulation, as any useful long-term reforms of Google and Facebook's data privacy practices fundamentally oppose their core business models: hyper-targeted advertising based on more and more intrusive personal surveillance. Change must come from the outside.
Unfortunately, we've seen relatively little from Washington. Congress and federal agencies need to take a fresh look at what can be done to curb these data monopolies. They first need to demand more algorithmic and privacy policy transparency, so people can truly understand the extent of how their personal information is being collected, processed and used by these companies. Only then can informed consent be possible.
They also need to legislate that people own their own data, enabling real opt-outs. Finally, they need to restrict how data can be combined including being more aggressive at blocking acquisitions that further consolidate data power, which will pave the way for more competition in digital advertising.
Until we see such meaningful changes, consumers should vote with their feet. DuckDuckGo found that about a quarter of American adults are already taking significant actions to take back their privacy. Helping in this effort are seamless browser add-ons that will block Google and Facebook's hidden trackers across the Internet, as well as more private alternatives to their core services. I can say from my own experience, you can indeed live Google and Facebook free.
If we do nothing about Google and Facebook, we will get more of the same: more hyper-targeting, more algorithmic bias, less competition and the further erosion of collateral industries, like media. Enough is enough.
The complete loss of personal privacy in the Internet age is not inevitable. Through thoughtful regulation and increased consumer choice, we can choose a brighter path. I hope to look back at 2018 as a turning point in data privacy, where we awoke to the unacceptable implications of two companies controlling so much of our digital future.

 4:51  PM ET Wed, 31 Jan 2018 |  02:15 
 Facebook reported adjusted fourth-quarter earnings and revenue on Wednesday that crushed expectations, as it made more money than expected from each user.
The company's shares, which initially dropped sharply in after-hours trading, recovered after CFO David Wehner maintained the company's 2018 expense forecast and said Facebook would benefit from a weaker dollar in the first half of the year.
 EPS: $2.21 vs. $1.95 expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Revenue: $12.97 billion vs. $12.55 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Daily active users: 1.4 billion vs. 1.41 billion expected by a StreetAccount estimate Monthly active users: 2.13 billion vs. 2.13 billion expected by a StreetAccount estimate ARPU: $6.18 vs. $5.90 expected by a StreetAccount estimate 
 That's compared to earnings of $1.41 per share on revenue of $8.81 billion in the year-ago period. Usership also rose about 14 percent from a year ago on both a daily and monthly basis.
 Facebook also said its daily active users declined in the United States and Canada, its most lucrative market. Daily users fell from 185 million to 184 million in the quarter. Its monthly user total was flat in North America.
The company said it had made changes, including a crackdown on viral videos, that reduced the amount of time users spent on its social network by 50 million hours a day in the quarter, or 5 percent.
Shares at first fell as much as 4.5 percent after hours, but recovered after executives said that advertising prices increased, balancing out audience declines, and that they expected operating expenses guidance wouldn't change, remaining at growth of 45 percent to 60 percent. 
In premarket trading Thursday, Facebook shares were up nearly 2 percent.
Facebook has been adding workers to boost security and said it now has 14,000 dedicated to site operations, or roughly double a year ago.
 Shares then rose 2 percent above the stock's closing price after Wehner said currency movements would provide a ""tailwind.""
 The cost of 'fixing' Facebook
 Facebook's fourth quarter marks the close of 2017's fiscal year, one of the company's more difficult years as a public company — and it showed in parts of the company's earnings report.
""Already last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people's time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day,"" co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the earnings release.
The company also said it cracked down on e-commerce vendors that had ""misleading"" ads during the holidays.
Zuckerberg has vowed to fix the issues at the social network, after a series of headlines highlighted botched advertising metrics and targeting tools. Critics have also raised concerns about censorship, safety and the addictive qualities of social media. But perhaps the most pervasive issue has been evidence that Russian actors may have used social media or ""fake news"" as a tool to influence the last U.S. presidential election.
The solutions to these problems could require future hits to Facebook's top and bottom lines. The company said that ""some measures of engagement"" may fall as the News Feed shifts away from featuring publisher content — which could affect Facebook's advertising business.
Facebook has also pledged to double its 10,000-person safety and security staff by end of 2018. These changes would all come on top of ongoing projects for the company, like investments in data centers to support more video, and an effort to limit the number of ads, or ""ad load,"" on the platform.
Facebook said that its staff has already swelled 47 percent over the past year, and capital expenditures are projected to roughly double, as expected. 
""2017 was a strong year for Facebook, but it was also a hard one,"" Zuckerberg said.
Still, analysts at UBS said,  there remains a ""wall of worry"" around whether Facebook is in a transition period around when it comes to user engagement. 
Nonetheless, Facebook still has new revenue sources it can mine for growth, including its ownership of WhatsApp, Instagram and Oculus, none of which have been heavily monetized. 
Advertising revenue at Facebook grew 48 percent from a year ago.  Eighty-nine percent of advertising revenue came from mobile users.
And like many companies, Facebook will face new tax benefits after a recent federal overhaul. 
Facebook also said that as a result of the tax bill there was an additional $2.27 billion in taxes for 2017, decreasing diluted earnings by 77 cents per share for both the fourth quarter and all of last year. But paying that tax will free Facebook to bring back overseas cash at a lower tax rate.
Executives on a conference call emphasized not only their investments in safety, but also services for international clients and small businesses, and Facebook's support of job creation.
""Advertising should be safe and civil,"" chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said.

 Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook changes reduced time spent on site by 50 million hours a day in Q4   
 6:14  PM ET Wed, 31 Jan 2018 |  00:46 
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday that the changes the company made to its service last year reduced time spent on the site by 50 million hours per day, or 5 percent.
 ""Already last quarter, we made changes to show fewer viral videos to make sure people's time is well spent. In total, we made changes that reduced time spent on Facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day. By focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term,"" Zuckerberg wrote.
On a conference call with analysts, Zuckerberg said that figure represented 5 percent of the total.
 The company has also begun to make changes to its content-recommendation software amid criticism that Facebook has been used to spread misinformation, hate speech and other violent content.
Last April, a Facebook user recorded and uploaded a video of himself killing an elderly man.
On the company's previous earnings call in November, Zuckerberg had said: ""I want to be clear about what our priority is. Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.""
The decrease in time spent could likely cause the company to insert more ads into the NewsFeed to keep ad prices consistent, said Omnicom's Hearts & Science executive director of digital activation Ben Hovaness.
Facebook's advertising sold through an auction forces, which means price is related to demand. As user time decreases, ad inventory in the NewsFeed will also decrease. Immediately, it will cause ad prices to go up so Facebook will have to balance the issue out by adding more ads.
""Facebook will have to increase ad load to keep costs stable,"" Hovaness said.
Zuckerberg made the comments as part of the company's fourth-quarter earnings announcement.
Facebook reported sales that topped analysts' expectations. Its profit was less than expected due to a huge increase in its tax bill caused by recent tax-law changes.

A pedestrian passes an AT&T store in New York.
 Check out the companies making headlines after the bell Wednesday: 
 Facebook stock fell more than 2 percent after the bell. The social media giant reported fourth quarter earnings and revenue that crushed Wall Street expectations. The company also reported making more money per user than anticipated, as well as a 14 percent increase in usership year-over-year. Facebook also said it's daily active users declined in the United States and Canada, its most lucrative market.
The report comes on the heels of one of Facebook's most difficult years to-date, in which the social network repeatedly came under fire amid concerns about censorship and the addictive qualities of social media.
 Shares of AT&T gained 3.7 percent in extended trading. The telecommunications company reported fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.78 on revenue of $41.68 billion, topping analyst expectations.
AT&T also said subscriber cancellations for the fourth quarter were the lowest ever.
Shares of PayPal lost more than 3 percent in extended trading. The online payment company reported earnings per share of $0.55 on revenue of $3.71 billion, beating the street's expectations of $0.52 EPS on $3.63 billion in revenue. PayPal also announced it closed a deal with eBay, securing PayPal as a payment partner through 2023.
Despite strong earnings, PayPal issued weak outlook for earnings and revenue during the first quarter of 2018.
Shares of eBay climbed more than 6 percent in the extended session. The e-commerce company announced fourth quarter earnings and revenue that fell exactly in-line with analyst expectations, reporting earnings of $0.59 on revenue of $2.61 billion. eBay announced it grew active users by 5 percent across its platforms, bringing its total to 170 million active users globally.
Prior to the earnings report, shares were up 2.6 percent after PayPal announced a continuing deal with eBay.
Microsoft stock lost more than 1 percent after the bell. The technology company reported second quarter financial results that beat analyst expectations on top and bottom lines. Microsoft also beat projections for growth in revenue from personal computing, gaming and business processes, several key areas of Microsoft's business.
The company announced a one-time, albeit significant, $13.8 billion charge, as a result of recent changes to the U.S. tax code.

 Cramer tackles Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet earnings   
 6:26  PM ET Thu,  1 Feb 2018 |  01:42 
 CNBC's Jim Cramer has noticed a pattern of ""downward bias"" among investors in the stock market.
 ""I'm talking about the notion that a slowdown lurks around every corner, as people thought would be the case with Apple tonight, or that pricing is going to get worse, a fret about Alphabet, or demand is about to taper off, the whisper that drove down the stock of Amazon in [the] late afternoon,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Did you know that none of these happen to be the case?""
""So many supposed experts and analysts keep giving you second-rate, or even just plain wrong, information,"" Cramer continued. ""They're used to things going bad for so many years and they just can't shake the prejudice even when everything is, arguably, coming up roses.""
 So, to make sure investors got a more comprehensive look at one of the market's most hotly contested sectors, technology, Cramer dove into the earnings reports from Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple after the giants delivered their quarterly results.
 Facebook
 On Wednesday, Facebook reported an earnings beat, but the stock seesawed as investors balked at the company's core website revamp.
Despite the fact that the social media colossus reported a 48 percent rise in advertising and forecast a strong growth story, the narrative that it was losing total user time on its platform because of the overhaul reigned supreme.
Cramer pointed out that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had prepared Wall Street for the trade-off ahead of the report, saying that the decline in hours would come hand-in-hand with fixes to the user experience.
""A lot of these negative commentators say things like, 'The daily user trend's bad news.' But Facebook told us point-blank that it doesn't expect to see any sort of long-term slowdown in daily active user growth,"" Cramer said.
Moreover, the actual improvements will reduce the number of advertisements and viral content on Facebook. The company's Chief Operating Officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said on the post-earnings conference call that they could lead to ""more monetization opportunities"" — music to Cramer's ears.
""A better user experience does translate to more users, which translates into, guess what? More money,"" the ""Mad Money"" host explained. ""The truth is, there's no immutable law of the universe that says things have to go wrong.""
 Apple
 Cramer saw similar negativity seeping into the market narrative after Apple reported what he saw as ""a phenomenal quarter.""
Knowing that tech hawks were worried about its iPhone production, the company gave positive guidance on its next quarter, predicting steady demand and strong pricing.
""The bear case, once again, failed to pan out, particularly with all the money [Apple's] got and what they're going to do with it, and it was right to hold it, not trade it, at least for now,"" Cramer said.
 Amazon
 The e-commerce giant's quarter gave investors everything they could have wanted from its retail, web service and advertising lines of business, the ""Mad Money"" host said
""I think its stock can romp now from the $1470s, where we're going to be when we're going home tonight, to the $1500s in a short period of time. I'd be a buyer anywhere below $1500,"" Cramer said.
 Alphabet
 Alphabet delivered what was perhaps the most mixed quarter of the bunch, but Cramer still believed in the Google parent's story despite its weaker-than-expected results.
""I was a tad disappointed, but then again, it had run up so much in anticipation of a blowout quarter that there was a letdown for certain,"" Cramer said. ""My take? Don't lose hope, don't lose sleep, it's doing well.""
 Final thoughts
 ""If you don't want to miss these moves, you need to stop assuming that the default state is for everything to be horrible,"" Cramer concluded. ""Sometimes, I almost feel like it's my job to be upbeat. But the reality is that I am not being upbeat. I'm merely being empirical. I'm telling you the facts. This is not a glass-half-full, glass-half-empty situation. The glass, to me, is overflowing and anyone who tries to tell you different, I think, is simply being rigorous or worse, quite disingenuous.""

 Facebook is not going to let users be overwhelmed by commercials says Jim Cramer   
 9:26  AM ET Thu,  1 Feb 2018 |  01:40 
 Wall Street is cheering Facebook's surging ad pricing growth, while downplaying any negative impact from the company's recent news feed changes.
 The shares gained 3.9 percent Thursday, hitting a new all-time high.
The social media giant on Wednesday reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and sales. Facebook revealed that changes it made to news feed, including a crackdown on low-quality viral videos, reduced the amount of time users spent on its network by 50 million hours a day in the quarter or 5 percent.
 KeyBanc Capital Markets reiterated its overweight rating for Facebook shares, citing the company's dominant position in the digital ad market.
""News Feed changes do not impair the power of the platform. Facebook offers reach, targeting, and ad-unit quality that is difficult to match, and they are the underlying drivers of its growth,"" analyst Andy Hargreaves wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. ""As long as Facebook continues to improve its effectiveness, the foundation for strong growth should remain intact, regardless of adjustments to the News Feed algorithm.""
Hargreaves raised his price target for Facebook shares to $245 from $220, representing 31 percent upside from Wednesday's close.
One Wall Street analyst said the company is still in the early innings of increasing its profit streams.
""Better-than-expected top and bottom line results speak to how early it is in FB's monetization story,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients Thursday. ""In our view, FB remains in control of the pace of its monetization even while aggressively improving/refining the quality (not quantity) of engagement on its platform.""
Nowak reaffirmed his overweight rating and increased his price target for Facebook shares to $230 from $215.
Credit Suisse believes Facebook can continue to raise its ad pricing. Facebook's average ad pricing rose 42 percent year over year in the fourth-quarter versus 35 percent growth in the previous quarter.
""The key driver of the offsetting ad price growth acceleration is the increasing propensity among advertisers to buy on a more targeted basis,"" analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a note to clients Thursday. ""We believe there remains a significant amount of room for ad price inflation to continue and therefore offset any potential changes to engagement.""
The firm reiterated its outperform rating and raised its price target for Facebook shares to $240 from $232.
Facebook shares have outperformed the market in the past year. Its stock is up 40 percent in the past 12 months versus the S&P 500's 24 percent gain.

David Wehner, CFO at Facebook.
 Facebook is showing that it's plenty capable of finding revenue expansion even if users drop off and ad growth slows.
 In 2017, the number of ads Facebook delivered rose 15 percent from a year earlier, slowing from 50 percent growth in 2016, according to its annual report that was filed on Thursday.
Yet the average price per ad increased by 29 percent, compared with growth of about 5 percent in 2016, the filing said.
 Facebook has said that ad growth would slow as the news feed gets saturated, but that's only now showing up in the numbers. Finance Chief David Wehner told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday that average ad prices in the fourth quarter rose 43 percent from the prior year, with ad impressions up 4 percent.
Advertisers are so eager to reach Facebook's user base, which exceeds 2 billion people a month, that they're willing to pay higher prices.
""The increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory,"" the filing said.
Facebook said on Wednesday that its base of users in the U.S. and Canada fell from 185 million a day in the third quarter to 184 million in the fourth, the first drop in the company's history. Still, the stock price rose more than 3 percent because Facebook reported fourth-quarter revenue and adjusted profit that topped analysts' estimates.

134,2018-02-02,Facebook Messenger chief explains why Facebook isn’t rushing into cryptocurrencies  Mark Zuckerberg says he doesn't want Facebook to edit news because its users can do it better  ,"Michael Newberg | CNBC
David Marcus
 Facebook's VP of Messaging David Marcus may have just joined the board of digital currency exchange Coinbase, but that doesn't mean bitcoin is about to show up on Facebook Messenger.
 In fact, crypto won't have play role on his platform anytime soon, Marcus told me in an interview on stage this week at Upfront Ventures' annual summit in Los Angeles.
""Payments using crypto right now is just very expensive, super slow, so the various communities running the different blockchains and the different assets need to fix all the issues, and then when we get there someday, maybe we'll do something,"" said Marcus.
 This skepticism is despite what Marcus says is a longtime interest in cryptocurrencies and his expertise in digital payments. He founded a mobile payments company called Zong which he sold to PayPal, becoming its president, before leaving to run messaging for Facebook.
While Marcus is wary of enabling Messenger's 1.3 billion users to pay with bitcoin, he's focused on encouraging people to exchange money. ""When you want to pay someone you always have a conversation about it...Payments is really at home in a conversational environment,"" Marcus said. ""The experience is really frictionless because it's debit card to debit card experience.""
Earlier this week, Facebook banned all cryptocurrency-related ads. Marcus defended CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision to block all ads related to the category, even though that means passing up ad revenue.
""We want to protect the community. That's job number one. All the legitimate people in the crypto world that I spoke to at least thanked me for what we just did with that move,"" Marcus said. ""The reality is the vast majority of these ads were a scam and we cannot allow scams to exist on our platform.""
 Marcus left the door open to reverse course, saying ""once the industry self regulates a lot better and you have better more legit products that want to be advertised on the platform. When we get to that stage, we'll figure out a way to reintroduce these things. But right now, I think the whole industry is actually very worried about what was happening because as a whole it delegitimizes the whole industry.""
I asked Marcus how much cryptocurrency he owned. He said he owned some. When I asked if it was more or less than rapper 50 Cent who admitted to forgetting about a bitcoin stash now worth millions, he said no comment.

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook
 Mark Zuckerberg says he doesn't want to censor the news on Facebook because users are best-positioned to judge the credibility of content.
 ""What we try to do is get our community to tell us what matters to them. ... People are smart. They know what they want and what's good. And they can tell us that if we can ask them in a simple enough way and get aggregate data.""
Zuckerberg has made cleaning up the site he co-founded in 2004 his personal mission for 2018 in the wake of its use by purveyors of propaganda, misinformation and click-bait scams.
 On a conference call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the company's fourth-quarter earnings, the CEO gave the most detailed account yet of why the company has resisted the wholesale editing or banning of sites that spread fake stories designed to stoke anger, hate and division among Americans.
This is what Facebook does instead, according to Zuckerberg:
""We basically ask people — we don't want to assess by ourselves which sources are trustworthy. I think that's not a situation that or a position that we're comfortable with ourselves. I don't think personally that that's something that our community or our society wants us to do.
 Facebook surveys not new
 Zuckerberg also revealed that the two-question survey Facebook designed to help it judge the veracity of news is not the first time it's surveyed readers to rank content.
""The way that we've done this for years is we've had a panel, a survey, of thousands of people who basically we asked, 'what's the most meaningful content they had seen?' on Facebook,"" he said. ""And we design our systems to be able to get to that ground truth of what people, real people are telling us is that high-quality experience.""
In reply to a question on the call, he also telegraphed what type of content he thinks will do well as the company starts to favor content that promotes interactions between users, rather than aggregate views of posts and videos:
""The example I gave before of The Wall Street Journal or New York Times. You know, a lot of people read those, a lot of people don't. But people who don't still think that they're high-quality journalism, in general, and that's not true for a lot of the other stuff that's out there. And we found that that's a reliable signal of content that helps to build common ground that is unlikely to be polarizing, that is unlikely to be false news.""

Facebook's internet-beaming solar powered aircraft takes flight over Yuma, Arizona.
 Facebook is looking to hire an ""extra-terrestrial product manager"" in Southern California as it plans for a future when the internet is delivered using systems based in the sky and in space.
 The company is looking for a veteran engineer with experience ""taking novel communication/aerospace systems from early development phases to productization and industry infusion,""  according to a recent job posting.
The extra-terrestrial product manager will be based in Northridge, California, and work in the company's Facebook Connectivity research unit, which is looking into technologies that include ""free-space optical communication, high frequency RF/mmWave RF, and electro-mechanical.""
 Like its larger rival Google and others, Facebook wants to position itself to deliver services within communication systems that use more than Earth-based wireline or wireless technologies.
The start-up OneWeb, based in Virginia and backed by $1 billion from Japanese investing giant Softbank, plans to launch 10 satellites in March as part of plans to build a space-based internet system using hundreds of satellites.
Facebook gave more details into its own strategy in the job posting:
""We are developing complex communications technologies that bring together advanced radio frequency, electro-optical, opto-mechanical, electronics and software systems into an array of integrated packages, and we need someone to help us interact with industry to transfer our developments into landed connectivity impact,"" the post reads.
Facebook has used satellite data to map human populations in about two dozen countries as it searches for the best way to deliver connectivity worldwide.
Last year, it also conducted a second test flight of a large-scale drone, called Aquila, designed to beam internet access from the sky.
An email to Facebook seeking comment wasn't returned.

 });On the 14th birthday of the launch of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg reflects on what he has learned building the social media behemoth.
 And to hear the 33-year-old entrepreneur tell it, he had to learn everything.
Now a titan of the tech industry and sitting at the helm of a company with a market capitalization of almost $550 billion, Zuckerberg says that when he launched Facebook, he had no idea what he was doing.
 ""I was 19 when I started Facebook, and I didn't know anything about building a company or global internet service,"" Zuckerberg says in a Facebook post published on Sunday.
""Over the years I've made almost every mistake you can imagine. I've made dozens of technical errors and bad deals. I've trusted the wrong people and I've put talented people in the wrong roles. I've missed important trends and I've been slow to others. I've launched product after product that failed,"" writes Zuckerberg of his missteps.

 mps._queue.gptloaded.push(function() {
 (mps && mps.insertAd && mps.insertAd('#dart_wrapper_responsiverectangle', 'responsiverectangle'));	
 });
 He also indicates he and Facebook still have room to grow. 
""It's a moment to reflect on how far we've come from that dorm room at Harvard and how far we still have to go to bring the world closer together. And it's a moment to think about what we need to do better,"" Zuckerberg says.
""We are still early in this journey and we will keep working to improve. That focus has always been our strength, and that's what this year is all about.""
Since the early days, Facebook has grown massively. Today, the social media behemoth sees 1.4 billion daily active users and 2.1 billion monthly active users. Notably however, in the most recent quarter, Facebook said users spent 50 million fewer hours per day on the platform. According to Facebook, that's due to algorithm changes made to reduce the number of viral videos displayed.
""The reason our community exists today is not because we avoided mistakes. It's because we believe what we're doing matters enough to keep trying to solve our greatest challenges — knowing full well that we'll fail again and again, but that it's the only way to make progress,"" he says.
Indeed, Facebook has had a challenging year. The social media conglomerate has come under intense scrutiny after Russian hackers disseminated ""fake news"" on the platform in a way that allegedly influenced the Presidential election. Further, the company itself has admitted that social media can be bad for users, if they scroll passively through content as opposed to engaging actively with individuals who mean something to the user.
In response to these and other challenges, Facebook has pledged to add 10,000 people to its ranks to — as of December 31, 2017, the social media giant had 25,105 employees — to address safety and security. Also, Facebook says it will change its algorithm to promote more local news and will prioritize news from ""high-quality news sources"" and users' friends. 
""Bringing us closer together with our family and friends matters, and 14 years in I'm proud of what we do and grateful to be a part of something so meaningful,"" Zuckerberg says.
""It's an honor to be on this journey with you.""

Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook
 Facebook is talking about expanding its TV-like service, Watch, into a rival to Google's YouTube by opening the platform to more individual creators, according to several people familiar with the plans. This would increase the amount of long-form video content that Facebook can sell ads against, and could reverse a decline in the time users are spending on the site.
 Facebook wants to allow more people to create their own shows on Watch, according to three media agencies who asked they remain anonymous because the conversations are private. Instead of buying rights to these shows, however, Facebook wants to create a system where creators can upload their shows for free, then earn a cut of the revenue from ads placed on that content — similar to how YouTube pays its online creators. Another source with knowledge of the situation said Facebook's ultimate goal is to create a sustainable ad-supported video platform, where it won't have to pay for the majority of content.  
Creators are hungry for other video platforms that can earn them more revenue after YouTube made it harder to earn advertising money on its platform. Amazon has also talked to advertising agencies about creating more ad-supported video initiatives.
 More broadly, the move continues Watch's encroachment into YouTube's territory. Currently not everyone on Watch makes advertising revenue. Facebookpays some media, production companies and creators for rights for their shows, ranging from $10,000 to $500,000 per episode depending on the length and exclusivity, according to four companies who have Watch deals. Some shows are uploaded for free on a ""partner"" basis.
Facebook declined to comment. 
 An opening
 Launched in August 2017, Watch is an effort to get more long-form episodic shows on to Facebook in hopes of capturing more video advertising revenue from leader YouTube. Early shows on the service have included ""Comeback Kids"" by digital media company The Dodo, and ""Struggle Meals,"" which shows users how to cook meals for under $2. Digital video advertising was a $5.2 billion industry during the first six months of 2017, according to a report from the Interactive Advertising Bureau.
Facebook said in December 2017 it will add commercials before videos, a first for the platform. At the same time, to make sure users stay engaged, Facebook is requiring videos to be at least three minutes long to qualify for ads in the middle of them, and those ads can appear only after 60 seconds of content. Previously, videos only needed to be 90 seconds to qualify for ad breaks, and an ad could appear after only 20 seconds.
Facebook also hopes the move to long-form video will keep people on the site longer.  Last quarter the company said time spent on the site was reduced by 50 million hours per day, partly because of News Feed algorithm changes. 
Google has provided an opening for Facebook as it clamps down after an advertiser backlash over ads appearing next to inappropriate content. To combat the problem, in January it announced a revamp of its advertising program Google Preferred, which allows companies to buy ads on its top ""safe"" videos. Under the new rules, a human must review every single video that qualifies for the program. It now also requires creators to have 4,000 hours of ""watchtime"" over a year and more than 1,000 subscribers in order to earn advertising revenue, as opposed to a previous threshold of just 10,000 lifetime views.
Media agencies say their clients are excited about the prospect of video advertising on Facebook, but most of the money is earmarked for buying sponsored placements in the News Feed rather than Watch ads. Brands are hesitant about advertising on Watch, and are particularly concerned about where their ads might appear, because Facebook category designations are extremely broad. 
Expanding Watch to more creators will make it harder for Facebook to vet content, they note.
However the company told two buyers it is thinking about allowing the purchase of specific shows starting in Q2. The method, which is similar to how television is sold, could be a way to weed out lower-quality shows — which won't earn ad revenue — and may convince advertisers to spend similar amounts of money as they would on television commercials. Facebook also seems to be considering creating a tiered advertising system, similar to YouTube advertising program Google Preferred, one source noted.

 Chip stocks turn volatile in sell-off   
 4:46  PM ET Mon,  5 Feb 2018 |  02:16 
 It was a rough day for growth technology investors. So-called FANG stocks lost more than $90 billion in stock value Monday. 
 FANG stocks are a basket of high-growth technology stocks — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (formerly known as Google) that have led the bull run of the last 9 years.
 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet shares all fell during the dramatic market decline Monday ranging from a drop of 2.8 percent to a 5.1 percent fall.
Alphabet was the biggest loser at $39.5 billion in value lost. The total stock value lost from FANG stocks was $90.7 billion.Even after the sharp drops Monday, all the FANG stocks are up so far this year. Netflix is still up more than 30 percent year-to-date after its strong December quarter results, followed by Amazon's 19 percent year-to-date gain.

 Comedian Jim Carrey urges people to delete their Facebook accounts and dump the stock   
 5:36  PM ET Tue,  6 Feb 2018 |  00:59 
 Jim Carrey is quitting Facebook and dumping his stock — and is urging everyone else to do so as well.
 ""We must encourage more oversight by the owners of these social media platforms,"" Jim Carrey said in a statement to CNBC. ""This easy access has to be more responsibly handled. What we need now are activist investors to send a message that responsible oversight is needed. What the world needs now is capitalism with a conscience.""
The comedian tweeted on Tuesday he was selling his Facebook shares and deleting his page because the company profited from Russian interference during the 2016 U.S. election. He asked all ""other investors who care about our future to do the same."" Carrey did not state how many Facebook shares he owned or sold.
 He added the hashtag ""#unfriendfacebook.""
 Tweet
 Facebook has admitted up to 126 million people saw Russian-bought ads intended to sway the 2016 U.S. election. The company has also said its algorithms recommended content created by Russian operatives. Initially CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the idea of Facebook impacting the elections was ""crazy,"" but later apologized for dismissing the real concerns. 
""For a long time America enjoyed a geographical advantage in the world with oceans on both sides to protect it,"" Carrey said. ""Now, social media has created cyber-bridges over which those who do not have our best interest in mind can cross and we are allowing it. No wall is going to protect us from that.""

 Snapchat is still growing faster than Facebook in this key market   
 6:57  PM ET Tue,  6 Feb 2018 |  00:54 
 Snap is still growing faster than Facebook in North America, the most lucrative market for both companies.
 Snap said late Tuesday its daily average users in the region during the fourth quarter of 2017 rose 5 percent from the prior quarter to 80 million.
Facebook said last week its daily average users in the U.S. and Canada fell slightly from the third quarter, to 184 million. That was the first time Facebook reported such a drop.
 On a year-over-year basis, Snap grew much faster during the period, with North American DAUs surging 17.7 percent.
Meanwhile Facebook's growth was just 2.2 percent on that basis.
The figures suggest that even though Facebook dented Snap's overall growth last year by copying many of its features, including Stories, Snap finished the year strong, helped by a product redesign.
In one test market, Snap said that the number of daily active users watching Publisher Stories on Discover grew by over 40 percent, when compared to the old design of the application.
Snap posted quarterly revenue above expectations, while its loss was less than expected, sending its shares soaring around 20 percent in after-hours trading.
Snap's average revenue per user in North America rose to $2.75 in the fourth quarter from $2.15 a year ago, while its overall ARPU grew even faster, to $1.53 from $1.05.

 FANG stocks can stabilize amid volatility   
 7:45  PM ET Tue,  6 Feb 2018 |  00:59 
 After several days of a rapid-fire sell-off that rattled global markets, CNBC's Jim Cramer and technician Bob Lang took to the charts to prove that some stocks are still worth investors' time.
 Lang, the founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and one of the three market minds behind TheStreet.com's Trifecta Stocks newsletter, specifically called attention to four of the market's most recognizable names.
""Here's the thing: almost exactly five years ago, Lang had this idea for a cute acronym that would sum up the hottest growth stocks around, FANG — short for Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, which has since become Alphabet,"" Cramer said. ""I liked the idea so much that I shamelessly adopted it. Some would even go so far as to say I stole it.""
 The ""Mad Money"" host admitted that the FANG stocks, like most, were not immune to the market-wide sell-off. All four stocks fell hard in the last week, only starting to pare their losses on Tuesday.
But in the last five years, their gains have been staggering, Cramer noted: Facebook is up 547 percent, Amazon has run 441 percent, Netflix has surged 967 percent and Alphabet has tacked on 183 percent.
In comparison, the Nasdaq gained 124 percent over the same time frame and the S&P 500 climbed 78 percent — not bad, but weak compared to FANG, Cramer said.
""More importantly, for the last five years, FANG has been incredibly resilient. As Lang points out, the so-called experts tried to crush these stories over and over again,"" Cramer said. ""None of it really mattered. Every time, FANG bounced back.""
So as investors reevaluate their holdings amid wild market volatility, Cramer and Lang took to the charts of each FANG stock to determine whether the tech titans could have even more upside.
 Facebook
 First up was the daily chart of social media giant Facebook. After making a series of higher highs and higher lows, a typically bullish sign, shares of Facebook tanked on Monday, pulling back to $180.
 Facebook's stock even grazed the $177 level on Tuesday before settling at $185, but Lang pointed out that its floor of support just under $180 has held true three times since the fall.
""Will it bounce again? Lang thinks so,"" Cramer said. ""He likes that the Chaikin Money Flow, which measures the level of buying and selling pressure in a stock, has remained positive ... indicating the big institutions still have an appetite for Facebook. Put it all together and he wouldn't be surprised if Facebook can make a move to $200 in the not-too-distant future.""
 Amazon
 Next, Cramer and Lang turned to the daily chart of Amazon, the e-commerce colossus involved in everything from food retail to entertainment to, most recently, health care.
 Amazon shares declined dramatically on Monday, but only after a staggering run, Cramer said. Just over three months ago, Amazon's stock was at $970 a share. Now, it's hovering at $1,442 a share.
The online retailer also reported earnings last Thursday after the market closed, causing the stock to surge by over $100 a share on Friday despite the beginnings of the sell-off.
""Lang likes that the Chaikin Money Flow has stayed strong here, and he also likes that the stock's recent rally happened on strong volume,"" Cramer said. ""There's really a lot to like with Amazon, which is why Lang sees it making a run to $1,500.""
 Netflix
 After spending much of January soaring to new highs, shares of Netflix dropped in recent sessions along with the rest of FANG.
 But Lang noted that Netflix's declines happened on lower volume, an indicator technicians use to determine whether a move is deserved or not. Weak volume means the move could be ""lying,"" Cramer said.
""Meanwhile, Netflix has a nice floor of support at its 20-day moving average, currently at $242, and the Chaikin Money Flow is still very high, meaning the big institutions continue to lap this stock up,"" Cramer said. ""Lang believes Netflix can go from $265, where it is now, to $300.""
 Alphabet
 Finally, Cramer turned to the daily chart of Google parent Alphabet.
 Shares of Alphabet took a nosedive after the company's weaker-than-expected earnings report last Thursday, sinking even more at the start of this week.
""This is the one FANG component that Lang's not feeling quite so sanguine about,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.
Lang noticed that the stock's moving average convergence divergence indicator, or MACD, which helps technicians spot changes in a stock's path before they happen, recently made a bearish move, depicted on the chart by the black line crossing below the red.
The MACD tends to be a reliable indicator, but Cramer pointed out that Alphabet's money flow was still strong. Still, all things considered, Lang came out fairly bearish on Alphabet.
""Put it all together and Lang could see Alphabet bottoming out at the current levels,"" Cramer said. ""He thinks the $1,050 level would be a buying opportunity, and if the stock can settle down a bit, he wouldn't be surprised if it can head back to $1,200. But he says it's probably going to $1,050 first.""
 Final thoughts
 ""For five years, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet survived everything that the bears had to throw at them, and each time they came out stronger than before,"" Cramer said. ""The charts, as interpreted by the incredible Bob Lang, suggest that this time may be no different. He does expect Alphabet to pull back some more before it can find its footing. But as for Facebook, Amazon and Netflix, he's optimistic. Me? I remain a FANG stalwart.""

Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Square co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey.
 The author of a best-selling book on designing technology products says the ongoing criticism of social media companies is ""very healthy"" yet in need of some ""perspective.""
 ""It's great that we're looking at the industry with a critical lens, [and] very healthy for us to ask whether technology is serving us or we are serving it,"" said Nir Eyal, author of the 2013 book ""Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products.""
""But we need to keep some perspective,"" added Eyal, who has taught a course at Stanford University based on the principles in his book.
 ""We're not freebasing Facebook or injecting Instagram. If you turn off notifications from Twitter, they won't bother you. If you uninstall Facebook, there's nothing Mark Zuckerberg can do about it.""
His comments, made in a phone interview with CNBC, come as criticism of Facebook, Google and Twitter intensifies.
Some of their former employees recently formed a group called the Center for Humane Technology that's dedicated to weaning users away from the technologies they helped build.
Last week a group of child advocates called on Facebook to shut down a version of its Messenger Kids app targeted at children.
That criticism comes after Facebook's own research unit found that passively consuming content on the site, rather than using it to connect with others, can be bad for users' mental health.
 'We're not helpless'
 While he applauds the intentions of those wanting to counteract the negative impact of heavy social media use, Eyal says the techniques being used by these companies can also be used for positive outcomes.
""The same techniques used by Facebook are also used to help people exercise more, save money, learn a new language or stay connected with loved ones.""
It's important for online consumers to remember that they ultimately have control over their online behavior, according to Eyal. If not, little may change.
""Users need to be proactive,"" Eyal said. ""If we sit around holding our breath, waiting for companies to change, it may never happen.""
Although some have referred to the problem of heavy social media use as an addiction, Eyal says there's an important distinction.
""We're not helpless and these products are not irresistible. An addiction is when you know something's bad for you, (you) want to stop and can't. It's not the product itself but the interaction between the product and the user. A lot of people get morphine in the hospital but only a tiny fraction get addicted.""

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook
 Tavis McGinn applied for a job at Facebook last year hoping to work in market research. He had previously spent three years at Google, where he helped large advertisers refine their marketing campaigns across the company's family of products. But part way through the interview process at Facebook, the recruiter told McGinn the company had something else in mind for him. How would he like to track the public perception of Mark Zuckerberg?
It was April, and Facebook was caught up in the fallout of the 2016 US presidential election. After initially discounting the possibility that fake news had contributed to Donald Trump's victory, Facebook acknowledged that Russia-linked groups had spent more than $100,000 on political advertising. Zuckerberg undertook a nationwide listening tour modeled after a modern political campaign. McGinn would fill another role common to political campaigns: leading an ongoing poll operation dedicated to tracking minute changes in Zuckerberg's public perception.
""It was a very unusual role,"" McGinn says. ""It was my job to do surveys and focus groups globally to understand why people like Mark Zuckerberg, whether they think they can trust him, and whether they've even heard of him. That's especially important outside of the United States.""
 ""It was a very unusual role.""
 McGinn tracked a wide range of questions related to Zuckerberg's public perception. ""Not just him in the abstract, but do people like Mark's speeches? Do they like his interviews with the press? Do people like his posts on Facebook? It's a bit like a political campaign, in the sense that you're constantly measuring how every piece of communication lands. If Mark's doing a barbecue in his backyard and he hops on Facebook Live, how do people respond to that?""
Facebook worked to develop an understanding of Zuckerberg's perception that went beyond simple ""thumbs-up"" or ""thumbs-down"" metrics, McGinn says. ""If Mark gives a speech and he's talking about immigration and universal health care and access to equal education, it's looking at all the different topics that Mark mentions and seeing what resonates with different audiences in the United States,"" he says. ""It's very advanced research.""
Facebook also conducted similar research on behalf of the company's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. Surveys measured awareness about Sandberg, whether people liked and trusted her, and how they felt about her speeches, interviews, and Facebook posts. McGinn also surveyed people on whether they associated Sandberg with Facebook or her personal initiatives, such as Lean In and  Option B.
The company further measured how Sandberg's public image compared with Zuckerberg's. The results were shared directly with Zuckerberg and Sandberg, along with their lieutenants, their communications teams, and external public relations agencies. Research included both surveys and focus groups and was conducted around the world, McGinn says. (He declined to share the budget for the project, but described it as ""very, very expensive."")
Facebook is not unique among tech companies in conducting surveys to gauge perceptions about its brand. Sometimes, those surveys include questions about founders and CEOs. Amid its own crisis last year, Uber surveyed customers on their opinions about the brand and about its former CEO Travis Kalanick. (Perceptions of Kalanick were so negative that the board used the data in an effort to persuade him to quit, according to a report in Bloomberg last month.)
 ""Facebook is Mark, and Mark is Facebook."" 
 But it is unusual for a company to have a staff person charged exclusively with monitoring perceptions of its CEO full time. Facebook began monitoring Zuckerberg's perception about two years ago, a spokesman says. The move reflects his close association with Facebook's brand and his role as the company's chief spokesman. The company regularly posts announcements on his personal Facebook profile, which has more than 102 million followers. Understanding how Zuckerberg's posts and speeches resonate globally could help the company navigate a difficult period in which it has faced stern criticism from lawmakers, regulators, journalists, and average users.
The company declined to comment on McGinn's role, but the polling was not designed to influence Facebook products or policies, a spokesman said, and no specific changes have resulted from it.
""Facebook is Mark, and Mark is Facebook,"" McGinn says. ""Mark has 60 percent voting rights for Facebook. So you have one individual, 33 years old, who has basically full control of the experience of 2 billion people around the world. That's unprecedented. Even the president of the United States has checks and balances. At Facebook, it's really this one person.""
McGinn declined to discuss the results of his polling at Facebook, saying nondisclosure agreements prevented him from doing so. But he said he decided to leave the company after only six months after coming to believe that Facebook had a negative effect on the world.
""I joined Facebook hoping to have an impact from the inside,"" he says. ""I thought, here's this huge machine that has a tremendous influence on society, and there's nothing I can do as an outsider. But if I join the company, and I'm regularly taking the pulse of Americans to Mark, maybe, just maybe that could change the way the company does business. I worked there for six months and I realized that even on the inside, I was not going to be able to change the way that the company does business. I couldn't change the values. I couldn't change the culture. I was probably far too optimistic.""
After McGinn left Facebook, he founded a new market research firm named Honest Data. On January 27th, he  posted the results of a poll he had conducted regarding opinions of Facebook. The poll, which surveyed 2,000 Americans using Google Consumer Surveys, asked respondents to evaluate a list of companies and mark which ones ""are having a negative impact on society."" Among tech companies, 32 percent of Americans said Facebook is harmful. A separate survey, which placed Facebook among other large brands including Walmart, McDonald's, and Marlboro, found that 27 percent said it is harmful.
The results largely matched McGinn's own perception. ""I think research can be very powerful, if people are willing to listen,"" McGinn says. ""But I decided after six months that it was a waste of my time to be there. I didn't feel great about the product. I didn't feel proud to tell people I worked at Facebook. I didn't feel I was helping the world.""
 ""I didn't feel proud to tell people I worked at Facebook."" 
 McGinn sees further opportunities for research into the company. ""It would be interesting to dig in and see where the breakdown in trust was happening,"" he says. ""Is it because of fake news? It is because Facebook isn't taking accountability? Is it because they're addicted to Facebook? I'm interested in digging deeper, and seeing if that trust can be rebuilt. Everyone makes mistakes, but if you break trust and someone says, 'I'm confident you will make this mistake again because you don't share my values,' that's a harder thing for a company to overcome.""
McGinn says there are ""plenty of good people at Facebook trying to make a difference."" He doesn't believe the company has acted with bad intentions. But he does believe the company's priorities have had negative consequences.
""I think Facebook could have a really good impact on society,"" McGinn says. ""I think a lot of what this comes down to is how a company chooses to measure success."" The company's historic focus on acquiring the maximum number of users, and occupying the maximum share of their time, distorted its perspective, he says.
""Facebook has never had on their report card, in my opinion, true social outcomes,"" McGinn says. ""From a business perspective, Facebook has done phenomenally well. Facebook is a cash cow. But from a social perspective, those metrics could be inversely related. The more Facebook builds profit, the more it's at the expense of the American people.""

 Cramer bullish on Snap, compares stock to Facebook's early days   
 7:34  PM ET Wed,  7 Feb 2018 |  01:27 
 Since Snap's rocky initial public offering and subsequent declines, CNBC's Jim Cramer has been hesitant to recommend the stock of the social media giant to investors.
 ""Yes, I justifiably warned you away from this practically from the moment it came public,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Of course I did. I mean, it was losing oodles of money with botched plans and little to show for it.""
But after the Snapchat parent delivered a top- and bottom-line earnings beat on Tuesday, sending shares up more than 40 percent early on Wednesday, Cramer felt he had to reconsider.
 With a pickup in user growth, longer advertisement viewing times, a broadening reach and a mission to cut costs, Snap's fourth quarter managed to turn the tide, the ""Mad Money"" host said.
""Sure, I was a skeptic, but after this quarter, I'm now a believer,"" Cramer said. ""In many ways, Snap reminds me of where Facebook was years ago when the company finally figured out how to address its mobile problem. So even though the stock skyrocketed up an astounding 47 percent today, it's got a lot of run room and it is a natural to be bought.""
""There simply aren't enough investable social media plays around,"" he added. ""The once-scorned Snap is now legitimate.""
Cramer argued that amid a week of wild trading on Wall Street, stocks like Snap are emerging as obvious bargains.
""The same wild swings that have crushed the averages allow you to buy individual stocks at absurdly cheap prices if you're simply waiting for them to come in,"" he said. ""There are too many bargains being created by the new nonsense to ignore, which is why I say that the disease of volatility will spawn its own cure.""
The ""Mad Money"" host called attention to the stock of The Walt Disney Company, which also delivered an earnings beat on Tuesday driven by strong theme park attendance, a hit-filled movie slate and a new strategy for distributing ESPN online.
""Most important, you can personalize what you want, which is incredibly important to the younger generation. I can't wait for the service,"" Cramer said. ""Disney's merging with Fox, a deal I love, made even more amorous by a strong Fox earnings report after the close this very night, but in the interim, ... Disney's buying it back its own stock hand over fist.""
So as investors decide whether to stay in or hop out of the increasingly difficult-to-predict stock market, Cramer used a line from Pearl Jam's ""Yellow Ledbetter"" to suggest a strategy.
""Don't be the bag; be the boxer,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""Take this volatility by the horns and harness it to pick off the stocks of high-quality companies that are cheaper than they deserve to be because of the nuttiness. And be ready for the next downdraft. ... The longer -term problems of higher interest rates and the possible re-emergence of inflation will make things tougher. But you can get tougher yourself, as long as you know that you're doing the punching and bagging the best merchandise you can get.""

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg
 Facebook is testing a ""downvote"" button that lets users flag and hide comments they deem inappropriate. 
 The feature was confirmed to various media outlets by the social networking giant on Thursday. 
""We are not testing a dislike button. We are exploring a feature for people to give us feedback about comments on public page posts. This is running for a small set of people in the U.S. only,"" a Facebook spokesperson said.
 The feature was shown in a tweet by a reporter from The Daily Beast.
 TWEET
 When the downvote button is hit, a user has the option to report the comment as ""offensive,"" ""misleading"" or ""off topic."" The comment is then hidden from the user.
A Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch that the reason behind the new feature is to let people signal to the moderators that a comment is inappropriate, uncivil, or misleading.
The downvote button currently only appears on public posts on Pages, not on individuals' accounts, according to TechCrunch. 
Facebook insisted that this was not a ""dislike"" button. In 2015, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company was experimenting with a dislike button, which ended up forming the basis for the feature that allows people to react with different emotions, which is currently on the site. 
The latest move by Facebook could be part of Zuckerberg's broader push to fix the social networking platform this year. Already the company has made a major change to the News Feed by putting fewer posts from publishers and advertisers in it. Zuckerberg said the goal is to start prioritizing ""meaningful social interactions"" versus ""relevant content.""

 Comedian Jim Carrey urges people to delete their Facebook accounts and dump the stock   
 5:36  PM ET Tue,  6 Feb 2018 |  00:59 
 Actor/comedian Jim Carrey really doesn't like President Donald Trump and the Republicans. He's also really mad at anything that may have helped them get elected.
 Oh, and it looks like he thinks you're very easily persuaded. 
That sure seems to be what's going on after Carrey's well-publicized call for everyone to delete their Facebook accounts and even sell their shares in the company. Carrey wants Facebook punished for profiting from Russian interference in the 2016 election and allegedly not doing enough to stop it from happening again:
 Carrey tweet
 Carrey followed up that tweet with a statement to CNBC.com that included this key line:
 ""Now, social media has created cyber-bridges over which those who do not have our best interest in mind can cross and we are allowing it. No wall is going to protect us from that."" 
Carrey has a good point about the Russian attempts to influence the election. The schemes to get access to both the Trump and Clinton campaigns are very well documented. Even more upsetting is the news Russia successfully penetrated the voter registration rolls of several U.S. states prior to the 2016 presidential election.
But his visceral hatred of Trump seems to be the real catalyst here. A look at his Twitter feed shows little of the humor and charm that made Carrey rich and famous. It's mostly just a litany of slams on the president and congressional Republicans, punctuated by sketches that sometimes get into obscene territory.
Carrey is certainly not alone there. A lot of us come off angrier and ruder on social media than we are in real life. 
But if Carrey's attack on Facebook really is an attempt to weaken Trump, he's going to be very disappointed. In fact, his efforts do the president a tremendous favor. That's because promoting the fiction that Trump won due to interference by foreign forces keeps Trump foes well off the right track toward political recovery.
The ""Russia won the election for Trump"" narrative has to be called a fiction because there is still no evidence of it. Even that troubling report about Russia hacking voter rolls doesn't say vote totals were altered. Any significant voter machine tampering would have been highlighted by discrepancies in the exit polls. Instead, exit polls confirmed the Trump victory.
That's why these conspiracy theories are so damaging to Trump's opponents. Politics are like sports. Most candidates can recover from losses once they admit they lost fair and square and recognize the reasons why.
The idea that Russia swung the election for Trump via persuasive ads on Facebook is a double whammy in that way. It convinces anti-Trump folks to believe they didn't really lose the election. It also masks the fact they lost for the same reason every losing political candidate loses: he or she is a less persuasive candidate than his or her opponent. 
It's a simple recipe, but political parties often get too bogged down in their own messaging to remember it's always about the candidate. Perhaps in the days before television or the Internet, you could run a successful campaign based solely on party identification or ideology. Not anymore.
The Democrats' best path to recovery is to start grooming candidates who have a record to run on that has nothing to do with Donald Trump. Some current and former Democrat state governors would be a good place to start.
The key is to find someone like Bill Clinton in 1992. He cleverly ran a positive campaign that wasn't about bashing Republicans or their incumbent President George H.W. Bush. He focused mostly on fixing the stagnant economy at the time. In short, the Democrats need to start refocusing on the voters' problems, not their personal nemesis. 
Yet this Trump election conspiracy theory has dominated the Democratic Party's narrative for more than year. It remains the impetus behind special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian collusion, even though it appears to have morphed into a focus on alleged obstruction of justice. The Republican pushback on the probe has now led to evidence that there was some form of collusion between the Democrats and the Russian agents who contributed information for the now-infamous Steele dossier. It's all pretty dizzying when you try to keep track of it. 
But what we actually know is far from sensational. Sure, the Russians tried to influence our election. They've tried to do that before. Where's the evidence they actually succeeded in any meaningful way? Do Facebook ads really persuade people that much? Most people have a Facebook feed that serves as an echo chamber for their beliefs and preferences. Moreover, an extensive study of Facebook user practices showed that conservatives were about 50 percent more likely to click on a story that opposed their political views than liberals.
If anything, the Russians seem to have chosen the wrong platform to try to get people who weren't already voting for Trump to do so. 
Yet Carrey is more than just hinting the voters were too ill-equipped to fight off foreign machinations. He and many like him won't accept the Occam's razor explanation that the Democrats backed the wrong candidate. Worse, they're making the same mistake Hillary Clinton made with her ""deplorables"" comment or Mitt Romney did in 2012 with his jab at the 47 percent of Americans supposedly too addicted to government aid to vote for him. That is, they're blaming the voters. That's like a company making a product the public rejects, and then refusing to change the product because it's the customers' fault.
Since Facebook really is a news content provider it should do more to reveal the source of political ads and politically-motivated groups on its platform. Those are the rules traditional media companies have had to follow for years. If Carrey's outburst helps make that happen, then that's great. 
But none of that will magically erase the 2016 election results or help the Democrats field a better candidate in 2020. Facebook's real and imagined misdeeds are just another detour on their path to political recovery.

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook
 Facebook will give up to $1 million to as many as five people and hand out a total of $10 million to community leaders who use its services ""to bring people closer together.""
 The company unveiled its Facebook Community Leadership Program at its Communities Summit event in London this week. 
""This program is about finding and supporting great community leaders wherever they are,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post.
 The company has faced intense scrutiny from critics who say it allowed Russian propagandists and other groups to use its advertising tools to target users with divisive messages, hate speech and other harmful content.
The company wants to reward those who use its platform for good, according to Zuckerberg.
""Our goal is to find people who are using Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger to bring people closer together,"" he wrote in the post.
""We'll pick up to five leaders around the world and give them up to $1 million to fund their ideas for doing even more. We'll invite 100 leaders to be part of our fellowship program that includes training, mentorship, and up to $50,000 for a specific initiative,"" Zuckerberg wrote.
