 Allergan CEO on the battle over drug pricing   
 3:17  PM ET Thu, 15 June 2017 |  02:02 
 Allergan CEO Brent Saunders believes an executive order on drug pricing could have a positive impact and he believes his company is well-positioned to handle any changes. 
 The Trump administration is preparing that executive order, which could be signed within weeks, Bloomberg reported Thursday, citing people close to the matter. The White House had no comment on the report.
One policy that may be included is a move toward more value-based agreements, according to Bloomberg.
 ""That is a good, positive, constructive outcome for the industry and for patients,"" Saunders said in an interview with CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Thursday.
Another thing being discussed in the industry as a possibility is more transparency around the rebates the industry pays and perhaps even applying those rebates directly to lowering drug prices instead of premiums, he added.
""Having them more directly lower the cost of drugs, I think, is a good thing and ultimately will lead to a more clear and transparent system for drugs because it is pretty complex today.""
Allergan has already committed to being responsible when it comes to drug pricing, releasing a social contract with patients in September. 
Because of that, Saunders believes Allergan is the best-positioned biopharmaceutical company to deal with a tougher or different pricing environment.
""We have great diversity. We already price our medicines I think very fairly. We don't take big prices increases,"" he said.
The question is what the rest of the industry will do.
""We have seen companies start to be, I think, a lot more responsible and a lot more focused on finding the right equilibrium between pricing and access and the ability to invest in innovation to procure the treatments of new diseases,"" he said. ""Where people set that equilibrium is a little different.""
News of the report sent drug stocks lower Thursday.    — CNBC's Eamon Javers and Fred Imbert contributed to this report.

 Allergan CEO: More millennials and men turn to aesthetic treatments   
 7:24  PM ET Mon,  7 Aug 2017 |  00:51 
 The ""selfie generation"" could be even more of a needle-mover than you thought, at least according to Allergan Chairman, President and CEO Brent Saunders.
 Of the 30 million people in the United States who consider getting aesthetic treatments like Allergan's Botox, only three million people actually follow through with getting the procedures.
But within that three million, ""we see two new groups that are starting to emerge: millennials, which only account for maybe 10, 15 percent of the three million, and males, which also probably account for 10, 15 percent,""  Saunders told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Monday.
 Both millennials and males are relatively new to the aesthetic application space, but the groups are growing rapidly, the CEO said.
""So, yes, maybe the selfie generation has a lot to do with this,"" Saunders told Cramer.
Allergan has made a concerted push into the medical aesthetics space, its recent $2.48 billion acquisition of Zeltiq being the biopharmaceutical giant's latest move.
Allergan will add Zeltiq's signature body-contouring technology known as CoolSculpting to its list of aesthetic offerings, which also include Kybella, an injectable double-chin treatment.
Despite rumblings that Allergan's management was disappointed with Kybella's performance, Saunders assured Cramer that the treatment works, it will just take time to develop.
""We are creating a new market – the lower face,"" Saunders said. ""It takes some time. It took us a long time to develop the upper face, several years. CoolSculpting, for fat reduction, it's been around six, seven years. We just hit somewhere around four, five million treatments. We're just hitting our stride. These new markets take a few years to develop. We should be patient. But Kybella works, it delivers exactly as the label indicates, and the injectors are getting comfortable with it.""

 Black, Jewish Goldman Sachs executive sues firm for discrimination, claiming bias killed her chance to land Allergan CEO as client   
 6:28  PM ET Wed, 16 Aug 2017 |  00:53 
 A Goldman Sachs executive who is black and Jewish sued the firm and one of its managing directors for discrimination Wednesday, saying her effort to land Allergan's CEO Brent Saunders as a client was scuttled because of the partner's alleged race- and religious-based prejudice against her.
 The lawsuit by Goldman Sachs vice president Rebecca Allen also charges that ""the discrimination committed against Ms. Allen should come as no surprise given that the Bank has virtually no Black presence in its leadership.""
And it says Allen has faced ""discriminatory comments"" at Goldman Sachs ""based on the fact that she is Jewish, including various inquiries clearly designed to determine 'how Jewish' Ms. Allen is, given that she is Black.""
 A Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, when asked for comment, said, ""We believe this suit is without merit and we will vigorously contest it.""
""Our success depends on our ability to maintain a diverse employee base and we are focused on recruiting, retaining and promoting diverse professionals at all levels,"" the spokesman said.
An Allergan spokesman declined to comment.
Allen was hired into Goldman's private wealth management division in 2012, according to the suit.
Since then, the suit alleges, ""despite her outstanding work product and results,"" Allen ""has been discriminated against in myriad ways throughout her employment.""
Specifically, the suit alleges, Allen was given ""substantially fewer and less valuable clients"" than male colleagues when clients were redistributed among her team after colleagues left Goldman.
The suit also says she spent almost three years working on a potential client relationship with Saunders, head of the drug giant Allergan, who ""expressed interest in committing significant assets to"" the private wealth management division.
But last November, the suit charges, Allen ""was abruptly removed from the Saunders relationship without explanation.""
The removal deprived Allen of what she believed would end up being $300,000 in compensation annually.
Christina Minnis, a partner in Goldman's investment banking division, was responsible for Allen being removed, after Minnis ""became Mr. Saunders' investment banking relationship partner,"" the complaint states.
Allen's direct supervisor, Corey Jassem, asked Minnis, who is white, why she was removing Allen from dealing with Saunders, the suit says.
""Immediately after that conversation, Mr. Jassem told Ms. Allen that Ms. Minnis had made an anti-Semitic comment during the conversation and said 'all this racist stuff,'"" suggesting that Ms. Allen had been removed from the relationship because she is Black and Jewish,"" the suit says.
Jassem also allegedly told Allen ""that he was so distressed by his conversation with Ms. Minnis and her discriminatory remarks that he believed he had an obligation to elevate the issue to Human Resources,"" according to the complaint.
But Jassem never did so, and later changed his story, telling Allen that Minnis had only made anti-Semitic remarks, the suit says.
""Jassem went so far as to blame Ms. Allen for reacting to Ms. Minnis' misconduct and accused her of being hypersensitive,"" according to the suit.
Allen later was told by Goldman's employee relations division ""that she was removed from the account because Mr. Saunders was not impressed with her, a blatant lie,"" the suit says.
Minnis was promoted earlier this year to head of acquisition finance for Goldman Sachs, a newly created position, according to Dow Jones Newswires.
Allen's lawyers, Douglas Wigdor and Michael Willemin, in a statement said, ""It is inconceivable that Goldman Sachs holds itself out as being a diverse employer when [its 32-person] management team includes only one Black employee.""
""Not surprisingly, as a result, the entire leadership of the Bank and the Private Wealth Management Division is virtually devoid of color, and, according to the Complaint filed earlier today, critical decisions regarding which professionals will cover a client are made not based on ability, but rather on the basis of race,"" Allen's lawyers said.
""We are confident that with the filing of this complaint, other Black employees or those that were denied a position at Goldman will step forward so that we can expose what is really happening behind the closed doors with regard to the denial of opportunity for entrance and advancement for qualified Black individuals.""

 Allergan reaches agreement regarding RESTASIS patents   
 1:56  PM ET Fri,  8 Sept 2017 |  01:23 
 Pharmaceutical companies do some creative things to try to extend their patents, but Allergan may have just taken the cake.
 Allergan said Friday that it transferred all the patents for its billion-dollar eye drug Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which then granted the drug giant back an exclusive license.
For its trouble, the tribe will get $13.75 million from Allergan, plus potentially $15 million in annual royalties. 
 Why? Restasis is facing multiple patent challenges, including some under a system known as inter partes review, or IPR.
The tribe, Allergan says, holds sovereign immunity against these kinds of legal challenges, and thus is now filing a motion to dismiss the IPR.
The result: Allergan potentially gets a legal challenge off its back.
""I believe it's novel,"" Allergan CEO Brent Saunders told CNBC in a telephone interview after the agreement was announced. 
""The actions today really allow us to focus the defense of the Restasis patents in the federal court system and avoid the double jeopardy created by the IPR system,"" Saunders said.
Allergan's stock rose 1.8 percent in trading Friday on the heels of the news.
 Mark Neuling | CNBC 
Brent Saunders, president and CEO of Allergan.
 The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe agreement doesn't affect Allergan's patent battles in the federal court system. That patent litigation, under the more traditional challenge through abbreviated new drug applications – or ANDAs – just wrapped a five-day trial in federal district court.
There is no precedent for this kind of move in the pharmaceutical industry, at least that Saunders said he was aware of.
But it has been done before with state universities, said Bob Bailey, Allergan's chief legal officer.
Bailey said Allergan was approached with the idea in early August. 
""My first reaction was: 'This is brilliant,'"" he said Friday.
The pharmaceutical industry has railed against the IPR system for patent challenges ever since hedge fund manager Kyle Bass used it to launch a series of attacks against drugmakers, while shorting their stocks. 
Saunders pointed out the legality of the IPR process has been challenged and is expected to be heard by the United States Supreme Court this fall.
Teva Pharmaceutical, one of the companies that has used the IPR process to try to invalidate the patents for Restastis called the agreement ""a new and unusual way for a company to try to delay access to high quality and affordable generic alternatives.""
""Teva will continue to pursue its ANDA and accompanying patent challenges and also will be interested to see what comments are made about this tactic by regulatory agencies,"" a Teva spokeswoman said.
The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe called the agreement ""a viable and sound opportunity"" in its joint statement with Allergan on Friday. The tribe is working with the law firm Shore Chan DePumpo.
In an interview, Dale White, general counsel for the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, said it is seeking additional economic opportunities, including a soy plant project and other contracts, to add to the revenue it already gets from a casino.
The tribe is based in upstate New York, along the border of Canada, with a population of about 13,000.
""We're experiencing what a lot of tribes are experiencing: unless you're in a heavily populated area, you may not be able to rely on the revenues from casinos forever,"" White said. ""Then this came along, and at first it was like, 'This is too good to be true.'""
So should we expect to see more such partnerships from pharma? Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat says, potentially, yes.
""Allergan just made a legal move that is extremely important for the industry to track,"" Raffat wrote in a research note. He said if Allergan's partnership holds up in the courts, three other companies may seek to do the same: Eli Lilly, Amgen and Pfizer.
White strongly agreed.
Asked if the tribe would consider other similar deals with pharmaceutical companies, White said: ""Yes. Can you put my phone number in your article?""

 Senator questions Allergan deal   
 7:35  PM ET Mon,  2 Oct 2017 |  01:32 
 Scrutiny over Allergan's patent partnership with a Native American tribe is ratcheting higher, with Senator Claire McCaskill late Monday calling it a ""brazen loophole"" she says should be illegal.
 Allergan's deal, announced Sept. 8, transferred the patents for its blockbuster eye drug Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk tribe. In return, the tribe licensed the rights back to Allergan, and employed its sovereign immunity to move to dismiss certain challenges by generic drugmakers. Allergan paid the tribe $13.75 million upfront in the arrangement, with the potential for $15 million in annual royalties thereafter.
Allergan pointed out at the time the arrangement only affected the challenges in a relatively new system known as inter partes review; the company still faces challenges from generic drugmakers through the traditional federal court system. CEO Brent Saunders said the move was to avoid ""double jeopardy"" in defending its patents.
 Analysts called the deal creative, and Allergan's stock initially rose. But since then scrutiny has mounted, with four democratic senators — Maggie Hassan, Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey and Richard Blumenthal — last week calling for an investigation. Allergan's stock has faltered, and Monday evening, McCaskill joined the fray.
""This is one of the most brazen and absurd loopholes I've ever seen, and it should be illegal,"" the senator said in a statement to CNBC.
McCaskill, who is ranking member of the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee, sent a letter to Stephen Ubl, chief executive of the industry lobbying group PhRMA, asking him to consider whether Allergan's deal with the tribe is in keeping with its ethical standards.
The group this year took moves to exclude member companies based on their commitment to research and development, leading to the expulsion of 22 members including Marathon Pharmaceuticals, which had come under scrutiny for its pricing practices.
""Given its recent comments regarding corporate responsibility, PhRMA can and should play a role in telling its members that this action isn't appropriate, and I hope they do that,"" McCaskill said in her statement.
In the letter, she asked PhRMA's Ubl ""to review whether the recent actions Allegan has taken are consistent with the mission of your organization.""
""I ask that PhRMA review whether actions to block patent challenges through claims of tribal sovereign immunity align with PhRMA efforts to promote innovation and discourage predatory pricing practices and anticompetitive conduct,"" McCaskill wrote. ""Strong action by PhRMA on this issue may discourage other pharmaceutical actors from employing similar tactics — with the end result of promoting and protecting affordable drug prices for American consumers.""
A PhRMA spokeswoman told CNBC in a statement Monday that ""as a trade association, we can't comment on individual company business decisions.""
But it added that ""the threat of inter partes reviews (IPRs), coupled with having to defend patents in multiple venues under different standards, creates significant business uncertainty for biopharmaceutical companies that rely on the assurance of their patents to justify long-term investments needed to discover new treatments and cures.""
The association supports reforms to the IPR process, the spokeswoman said.
Allergan pointed out that patents owned by state universities ""have been exempted from this same process"" of inter partes review, which a spokesman called ""deeply flawed.""
""Allergan recently completed a Hatch-Waxman trial in a Federal District Court in Texas on the validity of the patents covering Restasis, and a ruling is anticipated in the near future,"" an Allergan spokesman wrote in an emailed statement to CNBC Monday, referring to the traditional patent-challenge system. ""To be clear, if the District Court ruling is adverse to Allergan's patent position, and there is an FDA approval of a generic version of Restasis, that product could enter the market many years in advance of the listed patent expiry dates.""
The company reiterated that its agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe ""has no impact on that case."" If upheld, the patents for Restasis are due to expire in 2024.

13,2017-10-03,Allergan responds to mounting criticism of Mohawk patent deal  ,"Source: Allergan | YouTube
Allergan's Restasis medicine for dry eyes.
 As a fifth U.S. senator and four congressmen piled on criticisms of Allergan's patent deal with a Native American tribe, the drugmaker responded by urging the Senate Judiciary Committee to review the patent challenge system it's been accused of thwarting.
 Allergan raised eyebrows last month when it said it had transferred the patents for its blockbuster eye drug Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe in a deal designed to dismiss a certain brand of patent challenge from generic drugmakers.
Analysts said the deal could be emulated by other pharmaceutical companies if it's successful. But Allergan's move, initially heralded as creative and buoying the $69 billion drugmaker's stock price, has since drawn intense scrutiny and shined a light on a dual system of patent challenges in the U.S. Allergan's stock is down 6 percent since the announcement.
 Now it's responding to what it calls misperceptions by four senators in a letter they wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, requesting it open an investigation into the deal.
""The Senators' … letter is incorrect when it asserts that there has been an 'attempt to shield [the Restasis patents] from review,'"" CEO Brent Saunders wrote in his own letter Tuesday to committee leaders Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., obtained by CNBC. ""The opposite is true.""
The four senators, led by Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., called Allergan's arrangement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe a ""blatantly anti-competitive attempt to shield its patents from review and keep drug prices high."" 
Monday night, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., also weighed in, calling the arrangement a ""brazen loophole"" that should be illegal. And Tuesday afternoon, four congressmen from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, including Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., sent a letter to Saunders suggesting the patent transfer may ""impair competition across the pharmaceutical industry and ultimately dissuade companies from pursuing less-costly generic alternatives to brand drugs.""
Here's how the agreement came about: Allergan was facing patent challenges from generic drugmakers in both federal court and through a relatively new system called inter partes review, or IPR. Native American tribes, it turns out, like state universities, possess sovereign immunity from challenges under the IPR system. 
So Allergan transferred the rights to Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which licensed them back to Allergan. The tribe then sought to dismiss the IPR challenges. In return, Allergan is paying the tribe $13.75 million, and $15 million in additional potential annual royalties.
""It appears that Allergan's deal with the Tribe exploits the law to thwart review of the Restasis patents, protecting Allergan's market monopoly — and its profits — at the expense of patients who need the drug,"" wrote the group of four senators, which also included Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Bob Casey, D-Pa.; and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.
But Saunders argues Allergan is still facing patent challenges for Restasis, pointing out it just completed a trial over the drug's patents in federal district court in Texas, with a ruling ""anticipated in the near future.""
If Allergan loses that case, and the Food and Drug Administration approves a generic version of Restasis, that product could enter the market ""many years in advance of the listed patent expiry dates,"" Saunders explained in his letter.
""Allergan's recent agreement with the [Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe] has no impact on that case,"" Saunders wrote.
He used the bulk of his letter to urge the committee to review the IPR process, which he said ""has created unintended and negative consequences,"" including undermining the traditional patent challenge process created in 1984 through the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, also known as Hatch-Waxman.
Saunders also argued the IPR system, created through the America Invents Act in 2011, ""creates an unnecessary and unfair burden on innovators of branded medicines by opening up patents to parallel and often inconsistently adjudicated challenges before both federal courts and the Patent Trial and Appeal Board"" — a ""double jeopardy"" Saunders said last month that Allergan was seeking to avoid.
The Supreme Court is due to hear a case on the constitutionality of the IPR process this fall, Saunders pointed out. He said Allergan, drugmakers AbbVie and Celgene, and industry groups PhRMA and BIO are among parties filing supporting amicus briefs.
In its response to the letter from the House Oversight Committee, Allergan doubled down on its insistence that the IPR process, not its deal with the tribe, should be in the government's crosshairs.
""While we fully recognize their need for information, the Committee's focus should not be on Allergan, the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe and our agreement which does not shield Restasis patents currently being litigated in federal district court,"" an Allergan spokesman said in a statement. ""The focus should be on the IPR process and its negative impact on life science innovation.""
The congressmen asked for a response to their request for information by Oct. 17. Allergan said it intends to comply.

 Allergan trading at a zero pipeline valuation: Evercore's Umer Raffat   
 3:40  PM ET Tue, 10 Oct 2017 |  02:23 
 Wall Street's No. 1 biotech analyst Umer Raffat has two names at the top of his buy list —Allergan and Dermira.
 Shares of Allergan closed 2 percent higher on Tuesday but are down more than 14 percent from a year ago.
Raffat, who was named the best biotech analyst in 2017 by Institutional Investor on Tuesday, believes Allergan is trading like it has nothing in the pipeline.
 However, it ""is about to enter a fairly heavy phase of pipeline readouts starting in 2018,"" the senior managing director at Evercore ISI said in an interview with CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Tuesday.
Plus, compared with the rest of the large-cap therapeutics in his coverage space, Allergan's top-line growth is much more diversified and much less patent-risk dependent, Raffat noted.
""I also think the quality of growth comes from the highest margin parts of the business.""
Meanwhile, Dermira has a ""huge catalyst"" due potentially in the next six months — a phase three trial in acne treatment.
""We tend to think that they have a pretty good shot going into this upcoming phase three and that wasn't necessarily the case for some of the recent trials that failed.""
Shares of Dermira closed up more than 5 percent on Tuesday.

Allergan CEO Brent Saunders is interviewed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
 A coalition of 10 groups spanning hospitals, health insurers and generic-drug makers sent a letter to Congressional leaders Tuesday asking it to examine Allergan's controversial patent deal with a Native American tribe, adding voices to a growing chorus denouncing the arrangement.
 ""This issue deserves the prompt attention of Congress, and we encourage you to vigorously apply your oversight authority,"" wrote the group, which included America's Health Insurance Plans, American Hospital Association and the Association for Accessible Medicines.
The letter was addressed to House Speaker Paul Ryan, Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, and Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer.
 The letter came after at least nine congressmen already raised objections to the deal, in which Allergan transferred patents to its $1.4 billion eye drug Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, whose sovereign immunity could shield it from certain patent challenges from generic-drug makers. The industry groups, in their letter, argued more companies will follow suit if Allergan is successful.
""Allergan's transfer of patent ownership rights to the Saint Regis tribe is a brazen attempt to circumvent U.S. law and engineer a mechanism to maintain monopolistic high drug prices,"" the group wrote.

 It compared the move to another that drew negative publicity to the pharmaceutical industry in years past: tax inversions (something Allergan, in an earlier iteration of the company, did to headquarter the company in a country with a lower corporate tax rate), suggesting ""Allergan's scheme may be the first ever 'IP Inversion.'""
The group also sought to tie Allergan in with the industry's most infamous examples of high drug prices: Daraprim, made famous when Martin Shkreli's company Turing raised its price by 5,000 percent, and the EpiPen, sold by Mylan.
""Given the ongoing concern about drug costs, it warrants mention that Restasis generates more in annual revenue than both of those products combined,"" the group wrote.
Allergan declined to comment on the letter. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal Monday, CEO Brent Saunders said the transfer was a way to protect the company's intellectual property ""from unfair challenges,"" saying IPR creates a disadvantage for biopharma innovators and patients.
Analysts and investors originally applauded Allergan for the deal, which was announced Sept. 8, calling it creative. But since then Allergan's stock has declined 7 percent as criticism has mounted.
The company also is defending the same patents against the same generic-drug challengers in federal court, under a process established in the 1984 Hatch-Waxman law. Saunders has also argued that working with the tribe to dismiss the IPR challenges is a way to avoid ""double jeopardy"" on the same patent battle.

 Allergan CEO: Mohawk tribe patent deal not desperation, it was tenacity   
 7:07  PM ET Wed,  1 Nov 2017 |  01:09 
 Allergan's controversial deal with the Saint Regis Mohawk tribe giving the group the patent rights to one of its key drugs was widely misunderstood, Allergan CEO Brent Saunders told CNBC.
 ""I think there's a lot of misunderstanding on why we did it,"" Saunders told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer in a Wednesday interview. ""It wasn't desperation, it was tenacity.""
In exchange for the patents for Allergan's eye drug, Restasis, and $13.75 million (plus potentially $15 million in annual royalties), the tribe granted Allergan an exclusive license to sell the drug.
 The deal involving the billion-dollar drug drew widespread criticism, raising concerns that Allergan could now raise the price of Restasis while keeping it under patent protection.
A group of hospitals, health insurers and other drugmakers flagged the deal to Congress, asking lawmakers to review it. But Saunders said that it was simply how the pharmaceutical industry works.
""I believe that the biopharmaceutical industry is grounded in one thing, and that's intellectual property protection. That's why we invest billions of dollars coming up with cures and treatments because we get a very short period that's protected by patents to sell those drugs,"" the CEO said.
On the other hand, Saunders acknowledged big pharma's duty to patients and consumers.
""The flip side of that is I have a social contract that says when we are successful, we'll price it responsibly and we'll make them accessible to those people who can't afford them,"" he told Cramer. ""And I think people got confused that said because I believe in strong intellectual property, I don't believe in making medicines affordable and accessible, and one has nothing to do with the other.""
While Wall Street has turned sour on Allergan lately, Saunders said that leading the company past patent cliffs like this one is just part of the job.
""Look, we are tenacious. We believe in protecting our shareholders. We believe in protecting our employees and we believe in protecting our medicines, which means our patients,"" the CEO said.

17,2017-11-07,Senators question Allergan CEO on tribe patent deal  ,"Scott Mlyn | CNBC
Brent Saunders, CEO, Allergan
 Allergan's unusual deal with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe to gain protection from certain patent challenges drew intense scrutiny when the drug giant announced it in September. Then, last month, a federal judge invalidated those patents, appearing to render the whole controversy moot. Now, a group of five senators doesn't want to let Allergan forget about it. In a letter to Allergan CEO Brent Saunders Tuesday, Sens. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Maggie Hassan, D-N.H.; Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Al Franken, D-Minn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., requested documents and information about the deal, calling it a ""blatant attempt to further Allergan's market monopoly"" on its $1.5 billion eye drug, Restasis. ""It is difficult to conceive of Allergan's transaction as anything other than a sham to subvert the existing intellectual property system,"" the senators wrote. ""Put simply, Allergan paid another entity to take possession of its property, and then guaranteed annual payments for doing no more than holding the property and asserting a special legal standing to quash all disputes related to said property."" The letter was released ahead of a House subcommittee hearing Tuesday afternoon titled ""Sovereign Immunity and the Intellectual Property System."" Saunders wasn't among those testifying. In its agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawks, Allergan transferred the patents for Restasis to the tribe, which used its sovereign immunity to move to dismiss challenges from generic-drug makers seeking to invalidate those patents through a system called Inter Partes Review, or IPR. It's a newer system of challenging patents that goes through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Allergan paid the tribe $13.75 million, with the potential for an additional $15 million a year in royalties on Restasis. Saunders argued the arrangement allowed Allergan to avoid the ""double jeopardy"" of defending the same patents in two systems simultaneously: IPR, and the traditional patent-challenge system through the federal courts. But about five weeks after the deal was announced, the judge in the federal case invalidated those patents. The senators are requesting information from Allergan about the terms of the agreement and the benefits to Allergan; whether Allergan has plans to transfer patents for any other medicines to the tribe or other sovereign entities, such as state universities; and whether tribal sovereign immunity could be used not just in IPR challenges but also through the federal court system. As for the tribe, the Allergan deal wasn't the only one it struck; last month, along with tech company SRC Labs, the tribe sued Microsoft and Amazon for patent infringement. The tribe's leaders say these partnerships give it a much-needed source of new revenue. In their letter to Allergan Tuesday, the senators challenged the company's assertions that the arrangement is consistent with its ""Social Contract,"" a multi-part pledge to keep drug price increases to less than 10 percent a year and keep its medicines accessible. Saunders told CNBC's Jim Cramer last week that the deal was misunderstood. ""It wasn't desperation, it was tenacity,"" he said on CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" noting the pharmaceutical industry is grounded in intellectual property protection.
 Tuesday, the company confirmed it had received the letter, and said the senators' focus shouldn't be on the agreement with the tribe, but instead ""on the IPR process and its negative impact on life science innovation for patients.""
Allergan also defended its commitment to its ""social contract.""
 ""Allergan is not attempting to artificially extend patents, we're trying to protect our investment in intellectual property against a system that exposes our products to the double jeopardy created by the unfair IPR process,"" the company said in an emailed statement. It also pointed out the constitutionality of the IPR process is due to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The senators called the move hypocritical, saying the promise ""to increase access and to not substantially raise drug prices while creating and exploiting loopholes to thwart competition renders meaningless the entire 'social contract.'"" They asked for Allergan's response by Dec. 1.

A clinical technician holds a syringe and a vial of Allergan Botox, produced by Allergan.
 Shares of Allergan jumped 2.2 percent Wednesday after analysts at Morgan Stanley downplayed concern over competitive pressure for its key product, Botox.
 ""Fears about a 'better Botox' may be overdone,"" said analyst David Risinger in a note to clients. He noted that it ""could be difficult"" for competitor Revance Therapeutics to show that its Botox-like product, botulinum toxin RT002, ""is materially longer-lasting than Botox, which has been a concern for AGN investors.""
Allergan shares are down 23 percent over the past three months, while Revance's stock is up 7.4 percent in that time period.
 But Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to overweight from equal weight and maintained its $200 per share price target, which is 16.3 percent higher than Tuesday's closing price.
""We also think that mechanistically it would be difficult to create a significantly longer-lasting Botox because botulinum toxin gradually loses efficacy over four months due to neuronal regeneration,"" Risinger said. ""If we are correct, … AGN shares could benefit.""

 It's easy to call the market ""crazy"" or ""irrational"" in the face of an unexpected sell-off like the one that happened in the technology stocks this week, Cramer said on Thursday.
""But the market's not crazy, nor is it irrational,"" he said. ""In reality, traders tend to make wild over-generalizations. They act fast, they paint with too broad a brush and it's a mistake to assume that they really know what they're doing. In short, the market's often wrong.""
Even as tech stocks recovered later in the week, Cramer wanted to point out some of the most puzzling names that were thrown away by hasty sellers.
Cramer began with the stock of Salesforce.com, a massive cloud company with its hands in nearly every part of customer relations and enterprise software.

 With the CBOE, CME and Nasdaq hopping aboard the bitcoin train to offer their own derivatives of the wildly popular cryptocurrency, Cramer issued a warning about the craze.
""After its recent ascent, bitcoin's become some sort of abstruse casino game that seems to have only winners and no losers. You've got to like that, right? I think, though, that could change,"" Cramer said. ""Whenever any security runs from $5,000 to $10,000 to $15,000 to $19,000 in a matter of weeks or even hours, you've gotta wonder how long it will be before it bursts.""
Given the buzz around bitcoin, Cramer said that it could still have room to run even after Thursday's rally, which brought the digital currency above $19,000 for the first time.
But the ""Mad Money"" host still came up with five reasons to be suspicious of the trend.
 Boeing CEO on tax reform

Jim Cramer speaks with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg at the NYSE on Dec. 7th, 2017.
 As the House and Senate move closer to passing tax reform, Boeing Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg told CNBC that he sees the effort as critical to economic growth.
""I think tax reform is the single most important thing we can do in this country to unleash economic energy. It's going to unleash growth,"" Muilenburg told Cramer in an exclusive interview on Thursday.
Corporate tax cuts would be particularly good for Boeing, which had a 23 percent effective tax rate in 2016, according to the non-profit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
Muilenburg said that the global aircraft manufacturer would put the additional cash to work mainly by boosting its $6-billion-a-year research and development budget.

 Passenger traffic in the travel sector is growing at 7 percent a year — outpacing the United States' near-2 percent GDP growth — and Boeing is at the center of the trend, Muilenburg said on Thursday.
""The nature of the business has changed. Global traffic has become very networked, very connected,"" Muilenburg told Cramer. ""We've got millions of new people traveling every year. And so our business has turned from being a cyclical, commercial business to a long-term sustained growth business.""
As a company that focuses on long-term prospects (and one of the few public companies with a 20-year plan), Boeing is ramping up production to meet the pace of growth, the CEO said.
Muilenburg also talked up his company's partnership with NASA, saying that Boeing will beat Elon Musk's SpaceX in a space race to Mars.

25,2018-02-06,"Allergan smashes earnings estimates, says a trial for its migraine drug succeeds  ","Scott Mlyn | CNBC
Brent Saunders, CEO, Allergan
 Allergan on Tuesday smashed expectations for fourth-quarter adjusted earnings and said the first of two key trials for its migraine treatment was successful.
 Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street expected:
 EPS: $4.86 vs. Thomson Reuters' survey projection of $4.74. Revenue: $4.33 billion vs. Thomson Reuters' $4.28 billion estimate. 
 In the fourth quarter, the pharmaceutical company reported a net income of $3.05 billion, or $8.88 per share, compared with a loss of $70.2 million or 20 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter.
However, after stripping out special items, such as costs associated with Allergan's restructuring program, the company earned $2.17 billion, or $4.86 per share, above analysts' estimates of $4.74 cents per share.
Allergan clocked $4.33 billion in revenue, up 12 percent from a year earlier and above expectations of $4.28 billion. Worldwide Botox sales reached $864.3 million, up 17 percent from a year earlier. 
Restasis gained slightly to generate $414.9 million in global sales, up about 1 percent from the previous year. Allergan CEO Brent Saunders has told investors generic entrants aren't likely to hit the market before the second quarter. 
Allergan also released top-line results of the ACHIEVE I study, which measured orally administered ubrogepant 50 mg and ubrogepant 100 mg compared with a placebo in a single migraine attack of moderate-to-severe headache intensity. 
Allergan found the most common adverse events to be nausea, drowsiness and dry mouth, none of which was reported with a frequency greater than 5 percent. 
""We are pleased with the favorable results of our ACHIEVE I study, which support the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of ubrogepant,"" said David Nicholson, Allergan's chief research and development officer. ""We are confident that ubrogepant, an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist will be an option for the treatment of migraines in adults.""
Next quarter, Allergan anticipates revenue to range between $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion and adjusted earnings between $3.20 and $3.40 per share. Street estimates are $3.72 billion and $3.71 earnings per share, according to Thomson Reuters.
For 2018, the company forecasts revenue between $15 billion and $15.3 billion. The Street had been anticipating $15.33 billion. It expects adjusted earnings to range between $15.25 and $16 per share, compared with analysts' estimates of $15.50 per share.
Shares of Allergan rose 2 percent.
